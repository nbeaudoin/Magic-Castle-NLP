0,9/11/2019,"So this place gets a lot of love, and a bit of hate, too.  I didn't love it but I definitely didn't hate it.  It's an interesting place, for sure.The building itself is gorgeous.  It's beautiful on the outside and spectacular on the inside.  I'm pretty sure I read that the building itself is over 100 years old.  The business inside (the Magic Castle) has been operating for decades.I know they call themselves a ""private club"" and you have to be ""invited"" to get in (or stay at the Magic Castle Hotel next door, like we did) but I personally find the admissions policy a bit obnoxious.  It certainly didn't feel like a private club.  But it is what it is. Everyone has tips on how to get an invitation.  I got nothing for you on that one, folks.Yes, it's expensive.  Everyone gets charged an admission fee.  Let's just call that your ""show"" price.  Everyone is also forced to pay for either brunch (on the weekends) or dinner.  It's all you can eat for brunch but it's pricey, pretty much like any brunch.  Is it worth it?  Probably not but you gotta pay to play.Overall, you will probably be there for 5 or so hours.  That's a very long time for any experience.  So do the math and decide if you received value for your dollar.  I feel like we received value.Now, they give you a little pitch at the start about how you are ""guaranteed"" to see only ONE show and any extra shows you see would be a ""bonus.""  Oh, thank you, sir, so much, I sure hope the Lord is smiling on me today so I can get to see those bonus shows.  Personally, I really think this a little marketing pitch and a lowering of expectations so that, after you see all the shows, you feel like you received something extra or something special.  You received a ""bonus.""  Right.We went for the brunch because that's the only time you can bring kids.  The food was pretty darn good and bottomless mimosas are included.  There's endless shrimp, lox, crab legs, roast beef, salads, bacon, sausage, and an omelet station, among other things.  I liked pretty much all of it.What I didn't like is that the food is served in a ridiculously small space.  I know the building is very old and they are constrained by space limitations but they still could enlarge the food area; however, if they did, they would then lose some tables and thus, some customers.  So, they choose to sardine you and the food into a little closet-sized spot.Others have noted that they felt ""rushed"" by their servers.  We weren't rushed but there definitely was some strong encouragement given to us and others that if we finished up by a certain time, we could make it in time to see one of those special ""bonus"" shows.  Some people hurried up their brunch and left for the shows and others didn't.  I believe you can enjoy your food and not rush and still make those shows at some point.The ""guaranteed"" show was very good.  The smaller shows were fun but I got a little tired of all the card tricks.  All of the kiddos seemed to love all the shows so if you're bringing kids, they'll probably really enjoy the experience.Invisible Irma (the player piano) is a must-see/must-do.  Her knowledge of songs was excellent.  You've got to check it out.The bars throughout the building were stunningly beautiful.  I didn't frequent any of them but they were gorgeous.There's an old pay phone inside one of the men's rooms.  It plays ""alibis"" or excuses, if you're calling someone and want to disguise your true location.  It's pretty cute.  If you can go into this men's room, you should check it out.I followed the strict no photos policy so, other than the exterior and the lobby (where taking photos are allowed), I didn't take any pictures.  They are very serious about this rule, although I'm not sure why.Would I come back?  Maybe.  Would I go often?  No.  Was there value received?  Yes.  Was it an amazing value?  No, I wouldn't say that.   All said, I'm glad we went.  And my kid had a great time",4 star rating
1,11/1/2020,"this was my favorite place to visit by far other than Disneyland, I always wanted to go to the magic castle since I was 6 years old watching magic videos cassettes on VHS and to know I finally did with my beautiful wife Evelyn it was meant to be, one day we will be magic members that's for sure. I am still in love with this place the vibe was incredible and the magic superb, oh plus the food A+ the waiters were on point and very educated, I had the tomahawk steak OMG the best steak ever the meat was so tender to the bone I also really like the fact there's no photos inside so everyone stays socially connected with each other and focus on the magic I really didn't want to leave but the night was done, one can only dream again to visit this place the next goal is to be a member of this wonderful place called the Magic Castle",5 star rating
2,2/9/2020,"The Magic Castle (Hollywood, CA)I had this place bookmarked,for as long as I remember.But to get in here,you must be a member. Or you can be a guest of one,that's how we got in.For a night full of magic,and even some din. Here are the rules,so you don't get the boot.Dress code is enforced,so I bought a suit.Pictures aren't allowed,once you're inside this castle.If you're a Yelper or on IG,this can be a hassle. We started at the lobby,then ventured around.Every room had that excitement,like there's magic abound.A lot of card magic,the magicians are slick.Magic is more than an illusion,it's more than a trick.These magicians are skilled,and highly trained.They work hard at their craft,Are you not entertained? More than entertained I was,from the beginning to the end.I admit I was amazed,I can't even pretend.One thing I noticed,every one had a drink.There's a bar everywhere,in almost every room, I think. We also had dinner,as I earlier stated.I heard the food was pricey,and a bit overrated. I didn't think so,I liked my meal.I passed on the pork,and even the veal.I had their chicken,it was an amazing sight.I also did magic,food gone in one bite.My wife had their steak,she ate more than she could chew.So I helped her finish it,cuz' that's what hubbies do.There was still a final show,after our dinner date.But it was around 10 PM,I'm rarely up this late.The show was entertaining,but by then I was done.I still enjoyed the magic,and had a lot of fun.So, here's my advice,if you're not a member yet.If it's magic you seek,it's magic you'll get.We're not members,but family to one.She made us her guests,So we could enjoy the fun.Yes it was fun,regardless of the dress code hassle,The performers have talent,at this Magic Castle.",4 star rating
3,1/23/2020,"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Magic Castle with 10 people during the holiday season -- and two of them were celebrating birthdays that month, which is apparently a huge deal here. Now a first-timer to the Castle (Isn't everyone else, though?), I outlined a few lessons that I learned (sometimes the hard way) by the end of my magical evening:1. Expect to wait on hold for a long time to make or modify a reservation. I waited 27 minutes to make my reservation, and 52 minutes to modify my reservation from 15 to 11 people. Wow, that was not fun. The hold music is pretty lame, too.2. You have to order an entree from the dinner menu, but there are a variety of choices. And, per my friends, it's all quite delicious. I had the pasta -- great size, great taste. Prices are pretty high, but so is everything else here.3. Make a schedule, but don't expect to stick to it. We had a vague idea of what we would be doing that night, and we deviated from it quite a bit. For one, we didn't know where anything was -- but we didn't mind. There's plenty to see and do.4. Not every act is a magic act. In fact, our ""Main Show"" consisted of an acrobatic duo. Fun, but not magic.5. Visit during the holiday season. The lights and decorations only add to the appeal.6. If it's your birthday, tell them. They'll make a big deal out of it -- seriously.7. Bring extra cash to tip. Probably the biggest lesson of the evening: bring cash! Every magician has a tip jar, and certain rooms in the house have attractions with tip jars.8. It's easy to get lost inside -- let it happen. The Magic Castle is a fun place to let loose and wander around!",4 star rating
4,7/22/2019,"So i learned a couple more new things throughout my visits to the Magic Castle. Every bar serves desserts, quick bites and appetizers, but the coolest bar, in my opinion is the one that is on the right of the top of the stairs. The reason that particular bar is my favorite especially when taking first timers is because you can ask the owl yes or no questions. THATS RIGHT. you can ask him questions. another cool thing is behind the first bar when you enter, there is a room where the piano is. Maybe if you want to change or set the mood, you can actually request songs. Be polite, her name is Irma. You dont have to go around the room to order a drink either, you can order from the little window that opens to the bar. I may have to reiterate that the castle does open at 5, and you dont have to show up at the same time as your dinner appointment. You can actually show up a lot earlier, so you can still enjoy the early shows, catch dinner while you're there and then stay and watch the rest of the shows. There is an early set of magicians and a late set, so if you go into the room of prestidigitation for a 6 o clock show, it may be a different performer at the 7 o clock show and a different experience, so there a lot to do, you just have to time it right - i havent mastered that yet. There are close up galleries throughout the castle. There are 2 downstairs areas, 4 rooms for performances. Youre allowed to bring your beverage into all of the 4 rooms. You can freely walk in and out of 2 of them. I got called up on stage for the first time, too. Never knew the magician. Never seen him ever. No strings attached, and i was in ABSOLUTE AWE.  HOW?? WHAT?? 10/10, will come back.",5 star rating
5,6/30/2019,"Food: I had heard the menu had been redone and new chef had come to the place. I found that the food was incredibly lackluster, in the small caesar salad and in the tagliatelle pasta. The food was also served cold, which was both dangerous and disheartening. The waiter was only checked up on us once more after dropping off food, so I was not happy with the service. I had expected decent service and warm food, and neither was delivered. Performances - I give the tricks and magicians five stars. They are passionate about their craft. While I went on a weekday and there weren't many magicians presenting, the ones there were a load of fun. Overall - I average things out to five stars noting the high cost of entry to such a novel LA establishment. While I respect the invite only notion, I do not believe such a high premium should be placed on those visiting and looking to have an experience that is already coveted. I would imagine the castle is a successful business, but at the expense of the average person. Perhaps I'm looking out for the little guy with a dream, or just don't know the true cost of running a place like this.",2 star rating
6,11/4/2019,Hubby knew a member who was able to get us in for our Anniversary. This place has been on my bucket list for awhile. We stayed at Magic Castle hotel next door so that was convenient The Victorian mansion is very cool and unique. You are only allowed to take pictures on the outside and in the lobby so take your pictures before you enter the actual club. My husband and I had dinner reservations at 8 so tried to catch a few magic shows before hand.  This place was majorly crowded. I'm not sure if they limit the amount of people allowed in each night but it doesn't appear that they do. We were able to  Get in about 15 minutes early for dinner reservation. Dinner was fantastic. My husband had the Tomahawk steak and I had the prime rib. The service was also excellent.  My only gripe about this place is that it's way too crowded and chances are you won't be able to see most of the magic shows available due to lines. We were only able to get in 2 out of the 6 shows. It's a cool experience but not sure we would go again.,3 star rating
7,1/15/2020,"Nothing is more difficult or secretive in Los Angeles than this place! Magic Castle truly is a magical event upon entering and is worth the money and trouble to get in!Getting a reservation: Probably the most difficult part of this whole ordeal. To make a reservation you must either be a member, know a magician, or stay at the Magic Castle Hotel nearby. Upon doing that and calling to make a reservation, you may be waiting a good time on the phone just to get through. After, expect reservations booked far in advance! Mine took about 5 months out. Entrance: Two ways to enter; either through the members line or non member line. There is a small backdrop that provides one of the few places to actually take a photo. Once you enter, you can take a last photo inside the lobby while paying the entrance fee. Also, if you don't have a jacket to enter they provide which is a nice touch!The rooms: Come early to each room and enjoy the shows up close! Don't forget to stop by the bar downstairs for an awesome show. Each room rotates their magicians every show with the bar magician staying the same. The main show ticket is provided after dinner which I recommend coming early to as well. The food: Exceptional and expensive! Expect to pay a hefty amount for drinks or desserts as well but it's all worth it and top notch. Overall, this place is worth the hassle to plan. Just ensure you've got enough money to spend and the correct dress code!Come early prior to dinner reservations to truly soak in every show and room in the house. If you're lucky to come by the opportunity to go here don't miss this awesome chance!",5 star rating
8,4/5/2020,"My son and I had a wonderful experience there. I wanted surprise him that I planned the day at the Magic Castle since he has been always interested in Magic. We both had a great time watching wonderful performances. My favorite was Irma the ghost pianist. She was ""Pleased"" to play my request Canon in D; it was played so beautifully and perfectly  Thank you for the magical day",5 star rating
9,3/6/2020,"This has been and ever shall be my favorite place to drink in Hollywood. I've been coming here for years & I'm still discovering little surprises the building has to offer.  Such as:-A ghost that plays piano and keeps up to date on your favorite tunes. -A number of well placed (& a few well hidden) bars each with interesting bottles, unique character & top talent providing the pours.-Seemingly endless nooks & crannies where one can enjoy a drink, a card trick or some intimate conversation. For a long time the one complaint was that the food was lackluster but they must have hired a new chef in recent years because (aside from an overly salted risotto) the last few meals we had here were top notch. After maybe a dozen visits I'm struck by how I always find something new to dazzle & delight.  It's a bit like Disneyland but without the hour+ drive.",5 star rating
10,5/28/2019,"I finally made it to The Magic Castle. It is about time. I  have been hearing about it for years, but I didn't have any connection to get in. Now I am happy to say I have been here few times to this exclusive  and private club. I can honestly say that this place did not disappoint me. This place has a Magic university, Houdini room and a gift shop. Next door to the castle, there is a hotel, which you can stay at. I heard you can get free entry to the Magic CastleMagic Castle used to be called The Rollin B. Lane Mansion, which it was built in 1909. The Lane Mansion became the Magic Castle in 1963 after being taken over by The Larsen Family. The Lane family used to have a frequent guest, Irma, who is a pianist. She did not get along with Ms. Lane. After she died, she vowed to haunt this house. The piano was found in the attic in 1963, where it was moved to the music room along with her pet bird. Irma is still an intricate part of the castle experience, she appreciate her guests and will take request from guests on what music to playTo start, you can only make reservation if you have an invite from a member of the Academy of Magical Arts. This place is one of the world's most renown magical organization dedicated to the craft of magicHours of Operation: Monday to Friday 8:00am-10pmSaturday 9:00am-10pmSunday  9:00am-8pmWeekend Bruch from 10:00am-3pmEvenings 5:00pm-2:00amEntrance Fee$25 Monday to Thursday$35 Friday to Sunday$25 for Brunch Entry$20 for under 11 years oldParking$15 valet is the only optionThere is a strict dress code you must follow. They will deny you entry if you don't meet the dress code requirement. You must be 21 years old to be admitted to dinner. All other ages are able to come during brunch. For dinner, you must order one entrée per person and there is an automatic 18% for party of 6Once you get up to the castle, you have a place to take photo outside. Once you get inside, you can only take picture in the library. You will say abracadabra  or open sesame and somehow an owl will start to blink and the bookcase will open. You will walk into the actually castle. You will no longer be allowed to take any photos.You may ask for a tour if it is available. If not, you can just walk around until your reservation time. Brunch is a buffet style and very casual. For dinner, you can order from a menu. It is very fine dinning and the food is divine. I love that everyone is dressed up and very proper in this castle. When your check comes, they will provide you with a ticket to go see a magic show. I have seen magicians (Dale Salwak and Yuji Yamamoto & Mariko) at The Palace Mystery Theatre. They were really entertaining.  It is definitely worth the entrance fee. I was very impressed by all the talented magicians. Once the main show is over, you can walk around to see other small magic shows throughout the castle.Overall, it was an amazing and one of a kind  experience. I highly recommend you come, if you have the hook up. They do provide birthday celebration and give a button with your name on it for special ocassion. It is definitely a spectacular and magical experience that you can't get anywhere else. Interesting facts, Carey Grant was on the board member. He was the one who did not want any pictures taken inside the castle. He wanted celebrities to have their privacy. To this day, the Magic castle still honor and respect his wishes. Also, Johnny Depp was also on the board and  he is a foodie. He transformed to the current fine dining menu. As for myself, I am just so grateful to my friend for hooking me up so many times.",4 star rating
11,7/19/2019,"It's magical at the Magic Castle! Secret doors from bookshelves, multiple rooms ranging in old school decor, interesting architecture, several bars, a surprisingly tasty restaurant, and some of the most impressive magic I've ever been blessed to witness. Its $25 each at the door. Don't expect cheesy saw-cutting acts or magical acts that have been done over and over again. It was nothing like that. Not. At. All. At least for the magicians who were performing on my night...I was very much impressed! From the close-up magic to the larger full stage room, to the library bar, and the Parlour of Prestidigitation, most of the acts were things I've never seen and completely blew my mind! It was def one the most entertaining nights I've had since ever and it didn't really matter that it was not a cheap experience. But for the cons: The drinks are stupid expensive for super small glasses that have little liquor. I didn't even get buzzed off one $15 cocktail and it was on an empty stomach. The food in the restaurant is delicious, but damn...pretty pricey. Seriously $15 for some cheese bread? It's basically like a personal sized cheese pizza cut into pieces and throw into a bread basket. Overpriced. The lamb was good, perfectly seasoned, and cooked to a beautiful medium. The tomahawk steak was nicely tender, but wasn't seasoned enough and damnnn that price is up there. Way up there. The donuts were fresh and sweet, but a little too doughy. I prefer it to be a lighter, less dense dough. Overall, the experience was truly magical. You really have to experience it and be open to having fun and have your mind blown! Stop trying to figure out how they did that. Just take it as it is...it's magic!",4 star rating
12,1/19/2021,"Think Harry Potters Hogwarts with martinis and black cards. There is no other place like it anywhere... phenomenal magicians, great martinis truly a magical place and must see.

13,1/17/2020,"I know a lot of adults still go crazy for Disneyland, but for me it will always be The Magic Castle. This was my fifth visit--I've been for brunch and Valentine's events, but this time we were celebrating my friend's birthday. I don't know how it's possible, but this place only gets better. The bartenders are always fast and friendly, and the magicians are, well, straight up magical! The Close-Up Gallery always has the best shows, and it didn't disappoint on this visit. I was there with a member who frequents the castle regularly, and our birthday girl had been about ten times. We all agreed that magician, Jeff Kaylor, was the best we'd ever seen! (We actually exited the theater shouting at everyone in the bar to get their butts in there before the line got cut!) As always, I can't wait to go back!",5 star rating
14,1/6/2020,"This place is amazing!  Not only is the magic so much fun and entertaining, the food is really good too.  I love the prime rib and the special tomahawk steak for 2.  I feel like this place is an amusement park for adults!!  Once you enter the magic doors, it is truly magical!  I love to just let my imagination free and enjoy all the shows by the talented magicians.  Dress code is strictly enforced and no photos allowed within the vicinity.",5 star rating
15,1/24/2020,"We made reservations a month in advance and got a slot for Wednesday evening. They have a really Strict dress code - I Highly Recommend checking out their dress code online beforehand because they will deny entry if you're not in the proper attire. Everyone was dressed to the nines (Fancy dresses, Tuxes) If you're saving a fancy outfit for a night out- this is it! This is your time to shine! Entrance fee was $25 and you're required to have dinner. I think they charge a $70 entrance fee if you forego dinner. Each guest is required to get an entree, and we got the Bouillabaisse and Beef Wellington. They're famous for their Beef Wellington's and I was really excited to try it, but unfortunately it wasn't worth the hype. The steak tasted slightly dry and the pate/puff was mushy and cold.. it honestly tasted like an overpriced soggy pasty. The Bouillabaisse was pretty good though. The broth was rich and savory and it was filled with shrimp, clams, swordfish and octopus.  The BEST PART ~ The shows! If you have the 6pm reservation, you'll watch the main show at 8. If you come early enough, you'll have time to catch a small show at the Parlour after dinner. We saw Brendan Dooley and his show was brilliant. I'd honestly say that his show was as good as the main one! The main show had three different magicians: Arthur Trace, Kerry Pollock, and Zoppi & Rolanda. Their styles of ""magic"" are very different.. so grab a drink and watch all of the magic unfold in front of you for the next hour:) Setting: This place was originally built in 1909  but I think they remodeled the place throughout the years. The Victorian Gothic decor makes the castle captivating and magical.   I also love how versatile this setting is- it's such a great place to take a date, friends, family or even hosting a client. I noticed that a lot of company dinners take place here and I get it.. it's such a great place to unwind after work!",4 star rating
16,12/11/2019,"I really loved this place at magic castle, when they served us a free buffet on the Saturday. Also, I enjoyed watching the magic show with the magician on any showtimes from every different room. However, we're not allowed to take photos and video recording inside the magic show. Only the entrance of the magic castle. It's my very first time that I visit with my family as well. Hopefully, I'll recommend to anyone once in",5 star rating
17,5/7/2019,"When you say ""open sesame"" you know you are in for an unforgettable experience at the Magic Castle. The Magic Castle (""MC"") is one of the few places in L.A. that is exclusive to members and members' guests. I had the privilege to visit MC for a couple times in the past few years and not once I left the Castle without great memories. MC has strict dress code, so definitely check out their website for dress code before visiting. My philosophy is that you can never be overdressed, so if you want to wear your prom dress or fancy tux, please feel free to do so because you will look perfect for MC. Everyone inside of the Castle is dressed up, so you won't feel like you are too dressed up for this unforgettable night! If you got a pass from a member, make sure to call for dinner reservation 3 months ahead of time because it is very unlikely you will get a dinner reservation for the following week (unless some parties cancel theirs). The dinner menu was changed from 2017 to 2018, and they added more appetizers to the menu. I enjoyed fried oysters as an appetizer because the fried oysters were unique and not a lot of restaurants offer that. In terms of the main course, I really liked their rack of lamb, the lamb tasted really juicy and tender. The lamb is from New Zealand, so one thing about New Zealand lamb is that it is all grass-fed, so the meat actually does not taste gamey. My second choice would be the sea bass, it is cooked to the perfect tenderness, and will be a safe dish to order if you are not sure what to order (and also not a big fan of lamb).Personally speaking, I am not a fan of their ribeye for the price of $50 dollars. You can certainly get better ribeye from other upscaled steakhouses in L.A. Also, when you book your dinner reservation, try to book an earlier one so you can secure your tickets to the big performance. Those tickets will run out by 8 or 9 pm even if you have a dinner reservation at that time. If you are here for your birthday, make sure you ask for a birthday pin in the front desk at the lobby. They will write your name on the pin and you can keep it as a souvenir. As far as all their holiday events, I especially enjoyed coming to MC for NYE, they have some nice decors and offers all guests a free champagne toast by the end of the night. NYE party always have a theme, and for 2017, it was the Roaring 20's and in 2018, it was casino royale. You also get a souvenir for NYE in the lobby.Also another remarkable event at MC is the Halloween party, it is also the ONLY time you can wear whatever you want to the Castle since they won't be enforcing the strict dress code in the spirit of Halloween. I saw some people wearing zipper leather jacket, vans, and jeans. So if you get to pick when you visit the Castle, make sure try to come during Halloween or NYE for their special themed parties. I saved the best part for my last paragraph (sorry about the length of my review) - the MAGIC SHOWS! Since I have been to MC a lot of times in the past, I have to say Mike the bartender is a great magician at MC. You can check him out in between shows (close ups and the big performance). Beside Mike, I like all the close ups. Since the performers change every week, so it would be hard for me to mention some names as suggestions. But you can check out the performers on MC website so you can figure out which show to see and plan your night based on the show times. Also, there is always a chance you will get picked by the magician to go up to the stage to participate. So get ready to be picked by the magician during close up performances. In sum, Magic Castle is truly a great place to forget about the reality and enjoy an unforgettable night in the realm of magic. Just remember believe your eyes even if you thought you blinked when the magic happened!",5 star rating

19,12/11/2019,"I had the privilege to come to the Magic Castle because I was invited through a friend. We were scheduled to be there at 530 and we got inside at about 6pm. There was tons of traffic getting there and going up the hill sucked. I felt like if my car was going to go back down and hit the car behind me. There was no entrance fee and no parking fee for us except we did tip the valet people. I loved it here! We had an open bar and enjoyed the shows. My only complaint was the food. My steak was extremely rare. I like my steak well done and I received it rare and cold. The bread was also cold. Other than the food, I had a great time. I would recommend this place to anyone.",4 star rating
20,5/12/2020,"YES. Oohh yes yes yes! I've gotta say, my experience at The Magic Castle was absolutely amazing and words cannot describe how much fun I had the past 2 times I was able to attend a be a guest. My boyfriend works in the bartender industry and luckily came across some magicians at his work on several occasions. He had surprised me the first time for my birthday celebration last year in 2019 in July & I was so excited to go! I've always known that this place was a mysterious, top secret, and luxurious place that only magicians and their guests could enjoy on operating nights. I have to admit, I felt like a princess coming here. Growing up I've been the biggest fan of magic, and to have this opportunity was one for the books in my history of birthdays! I was so in awe during my first visit here because there's always some sort of magical component of the castle that leaves me speechless. Every patron who enters this castle is dressed up as if they were attending a Hollywood red carpet affair (or rather, suit and tie apparel, ladies in formal wear). Honestly, it felt really good to get all dolled up just to join a bunch of other people, and we all had one goal.. to have a great time. There were several bars throughout the castle, one right after the entrance and others scattered around. For those of you who need a drink immediately, here's your chance!~We were given pamphlet with a list of various magicians and showtimes, which could be easily navigated based on how you prefer to spread your time and experience through the night. The pamphlet also included a big show in the late evening (only if you choose to dine in at the castle) and other options of close magic time slots upon check in if you were curious. The magicians who learn their tricks in this magicians academy are beyond talented and I cannot praise how great they are; I have to say, my first visit in July 2019 was actually during the Junior star magicians week, so I had the change to see the young ones perform. The 2nd trip to the magic castle opened up another door of magic as I gazed in shock over the talented young and older magicians. SUPER DUPER AMAZZZINNG.Pros: Awesome experience, hands down. You have to actually be immersed into vibe to fully understand how I felt the moment I went in. It's definitely left me without words because my past 2 experiences here have let me wanting to come back again for another good time and memories with my friends! The castle offers valet parking which is charged with your guest entry fees, excellent service and food (I've always opted for the Tomahawk steak, which is ginormous and good for 2 ppl, but you are required to have an entree/person). *Refer to my steak pic, yumm.. Not to worry, lots of leftovers for the next day! Pro tip: get there as early as you can so you have more time to enjoy the magic shows, have time to eat, and spend time with your company/ party! I've found it so exhilarating to come at the start opening and be there til the castle closes. Well worth your time and memories!Cons: Be prepared to have a dent in your wallet if you plan to take a special someone or a big party here; Entry fee, nonstop drinks, dinner, and valet charges can add up!  Honestly, I'd say it's all worth your experience here if you've never been, and I always look forward to the next time I will get to see the inside of this castle again!",5 star rating
21,2/22/2020,"This place was very interesting and fun. You don't just see one magic show, you'll see mini Magic Shows . After catching the main show make sure you see all the smaller shows. We seen Ice McDonald wow was this an awesome and outstanding show. It even takes you back to childhood and your first magic show.There are many card tricks all around and an old museums to look at. The food is great, but don't forget to have a few drinks with your few laughs. Now you know Magic always looks better when you've had a few drinks. Over all this was definitely a five star and a wonderful place A honeymoon, first date, or just to get out the house.PS oh but I forgot to mention you have to be invited.",5 star rating
22,12/20/2019,"Came here for a company party. Apparently we were able to bypass the invite only by reserving over a party of 20+ people, so bring lots of cash money if you don't have an invite to get in.The dress code is on their website and rather strict and fancy, although I did see the front staff offer a guy some dress shoes since his were not up to par. Maybe they have extras in the back?The inside was very late 1800s/early 1900s Sherlock Holmes/dark library aesthetic so super fun but no photography allowed. They had a variety of drinks but all made very strongly. So if you're not a heavyweight like me, they have tea and coffee available. I actually ordered the tea and you get your own little teapot and a selection of tea bags to choose from. Mostly Twinings.Lots of cool places to explore and look at as the inside is very detailed. Even the bathrooms were very nice and matched the theme as well. And a magical piano!We had a nice sit down dinner with warm bread, soup and salad, salmon, prime rib, and mushroom ravioli. Dessert was a choice between strawberry rhubarb pie (shaped in a circle tart) or coconut cream pie. Both pies were pretty tasty. The food was decent although the ravioli was a bit too al dente. Would recommend the prime rib but they cook it quite rare so make sure you let the servers know your preferences beforehand.We then went to watch a show in one of their theaters which was quite intimate and fit about 60 or so people. But every seat had a great view of the stage. We saw lots of sleight of hand acts, a disappearing fire act, and acrobatics. Really entertaining a d the hour flew by. There are also a variety of smaller acts that you can go see as well.Overall, great staff and experience. They even have a gift shop and academy you can go to become a magician!",4 star rating
23,1/20/2019,"I know just a handful of people who got to go to the Magic Castle. It's a legendary place in LA that you read about it.We got an invitation to the Castle in the summer, befriending a lady magician at a picnic at the Hollywood Bowl.So, I started to look into it, see what we want to do since the invitation does have an expiration date. My in laws booked tickets for a X-mas vacation here, they always wanted to go to the Magic Castle, so I booked a reservation for late December, 6 months in advance or so...I did my research, and thanks to my Yelp Friends (Jenni M, Tora M, Isobel L, thanks guys!!!!) I had a strategy going into this evening. I did book my dinner at 6 pm to have an early start at 5 pm, right as they open. And we started to shop for clothes since they have a strict dress code, my husband had to buy a tie (doesn't like ties, didn't wear one at our wedding, fine by me), and I got my dress since it was gonna be a winter night in LA! Ladies, bring a shawl, it's on the cooler side inside!We did arrive at 5 pm, keep going on Franklin till you see signs for parking and entrance. Did the valet ($15) - you pay inside alongside the entrance fee (A steep $35 since it was a weekend evening!). My husband still got scolded to button his shirt more and tighten his tie (he wasn't a fan), I think it's a bit much especially if you're an artist, and this place is dedicated to the arts and magic!The Castle is beautiful decorated for X-mas, the Victorian mansion was turned into the Magic Castle in the early '70-s.Take photos outside and in the main lobby! You won't be allowed afterwords. You'll be given a code to say to The Owl and then, the doors are opened. Once inside, they were seating for the Close-Up Gallery, we were invited in, so of course we wanted to see a show, my husband got pulled in as a magician's assistant (no I don't have photos), it's an intimate theater and the show was fun, interactive.After the show, we went to dinner. Everyone here is a showman, the waiter, his aide, they're all set to entertain you!The food was better than I thought, especially since their menu is based on a lot of old-fashioned dishes (Beef Wellington, anyone?). We started with garlic bread (very good) and brussel sprouts (with pancetta) as appetizers to go along with the wine (got the Armida Red Zinfandel, pretty good). The dishes were nice.I got the Voodoo Chicken (so did my husband), it is a more modern, interesting dish. The chicken was well cooked, the potatoes and onions were light. I'd recommend it. The sea bass was a hit as well in our party.We got the Strawberry Tres Leches for dessert, light, moist, delicious.Prices are high for dinner, an entree is around $40, so save up!But the dinner entree gets you a ticket to the main show at 8 pm at the Palace of Mystery. Line up early, the place isn't that big.It is a lot of lining up and waiting to get inside shows.Honestly, I wasn't impressed with the main show, it had funny parts to it, but I wanted to see more magic, more interesting numbers. I've seen better than tables floating up in the air and magic card tricks!Once we came out of this show, it was crazy crowded inside the mansion, people at the bar, drunk, lines for the next shows that we tried to get in with no luck= full. I felt like with all the invites and membership, they let too many people inside, beyond capacity! It was hard to move, got to the restroom, find another way to go to another show. It was impossible for a way to move through the crowds. I get that they make a lot of money pushing drinks on you, continuously and the bars are full. It was hard to see smaller acts around the bar. By this point everyone is three sheets...We were ready to leave when we got pulled in to wait for a 10 pm show at the same Close-Up Gallery. We did want to see at least one more show. So we got pushed in this small waiting area (super cold, AC blasting!!!) and sat down. Well, a drunk older lady sat in my father in law's lap! He told her ""You're siting in my lap"" and she responded ""Yes, I know"". I guess she liked him or wanted his seat? 'Cause she got it!After a 15 min. wait we got to see another show, a bit too interactive for me, at too complicated, too much math involved for me at that late hour! After that, we did leave.Conclusions? I wish I'd have seen one more show in another theater. I'd have stayed longer if I wasn't with my in laws, but that's not the issue. I thought that they let too many people in, some who just came to party only. But we're strict about that dress code when we have lots of tipsy folks around who lose their manners, right?Would I go to the Magic Castle again? Not sure, I wasn't taken with it. At the best case scenario I'd go during the week time, save some money and hopefully see more shows.Food was good (better be for that price), but I wasn't taken with the magic numbers, I wanted more...magic? Yes! More complicated acts, more interesting, more out of this world.",3 star rating
24,11/15/2019,"Such a quirky, wonder of a place. We went on a Thursday when all of the rooms are open and had a blast exploring the many floors and nooks and crannies where magicians were plying their trade. You really need to come early and give yourself time to wander, because you'll want to see the big stage show and catch the smaller ones, too. Plus there are many people doing close up work at tables around the venue. We were there 3.5 hours and really just scratched the surface. Next time I would skip dinner so I could get more of the shows in!Also, you can get a 25 minute tour from a member standing in the vestibule. We would definitely do that next time.You need to know a member, so there's the rub. But if you can find one, it's a must see LA place/activity.",5 star rating
25,11/11/2019,"An exclusive club that has the entrance and glamor of what it promises, from a red carpet entry way where you can get your picture taken after dropping your car off by valet.  Entrance is either by staying at the hotel, or by knowing someone who is a member of the Magic Castle (amateur and professional magicians).  I have now been here for both their Sunday Brunch and for their Dinner.  Overall prices are a little high with $45 per person for brunch and about $40-50 per person for dinner.  I feel their Brunch is a better value since it is a buffet including prime rib, crab, smoked salmon, and omelette station with unlimited mimosas.  Their dinner selection is solid, including Beef Wellington which I enjoyed, but to be honest, your $40-50 is not going towards the food, but for the entertainment/experienceAfter your meal, you get a ticket for a magic show, which is always different week to week.  The magicians are always interactive and fun to watch.  On the Brunch shows, they feature a young Magician from their training/mentoring program, which is fun to see a developing act of what could become a headlining act in the future.  They have several smaller shows you can view as well, which are also equally as good.Overall, exclusive and a bit expensive ($15 valet and $25 entrance/show fee on top of dinner), but well worth the money since it's a dinner/brunch and show.  Food is solid but not amazing.  However an Excellent experience overall.",4 star rating
26,3/1/2019,"Where do I begin? You need a suit and tie, and a member to get you in. Very exclusive. My girlfriends cousin is a Magician and member so problem solved. There are a couple other ways to get in, but you need to look them up online.The drive up the hill in downtown LA I stunning. And a bit of a maze. The building is a wonderfully restored massive house on the hill. In front there  is a frenzied activity of people coming and going. The house and the fountains are lit up at night. Welcome to the Magic Castle Hotel and Club. Also know as ""The Academy of Magical Arts."" After checking in outside, you are required to check-in inside. There we were told no pictures at all once inside the club. If you are seen taking any, you will be asked to leave. And they mean it.We were instructed to go to an object at the bookshelf and speak magic expressions to it like ""Open Sesame."" And the wall slides open revealing a massive bar crowded with throngs of joyous well dressed people. For the next 3 hours were lead from room to room, attic to cellar seeing demonstrations and shows.Some of the magic I figured out, but some completely blew my mind. This is one of the most interesting places I have ever been. And the place is always packed.The restaurant and food was five star. The cocktails perfect, and the talent mind bending. The tour docents are lively and informative from history to being magicians themselves.Just saying you are a magician doesn't necessarily open doors. There is a rigid process if you don't have a performance history outside the club. But Amateur magicians are encouraged to join at a different level to perfect their craft. The largest collection of books on magic are in a 'members only' private library.There is celebrity spotting there too. I saw a 60s TV cowboy star sitting behind me at a show. These shows can be large in a big room or very intimate in smaller ones. There are also many private rooms open to everyone with visiting magicians performing. I couldn't tell you how many rooms have something going on, but its a lot. That house is massive.Just go there for the most fun you'll ever have in LA. It's ... well ... MAGIC.",5 star rating
27,4/2/2019,"FUUUNNNN!! So much magic around you. I have been here a few times before but it's been forever and yet it still held all it's magic for me.Wish I could post photos but your not allowed to take any inside.But there is a step and repeat for photo opportunity before you go in.We had a large group since we were celebrating a couple b-days. They were very helpful in being accommodating.  Entertainment: It's all about the magic and being entertained by almost all staff. Different rooms of magic taking place. It's been a few days and we are still talking about Stan's trick with the lemon.... can't give too much away as you must experience it yourself.Booze: master of ceremony is what I believe my experimental drink was.... sweet and yummy and then the lemon drops were amazingly strong (Yay!)Food: I had the salad, short rib with mashed potato and then cheesecake for dessert. Food was pretty good and my friends loved their sea bass.There is a dress code and they are strict about it but I think that's perfectly fine with the ambiance, and elite status of the magic castle it should be that way.Looking forward to going back in a smaller group since we had so much fun but difficult to maneuver with 40 of us there at the same time.",4 star rating

30,1/21/2019,"For those of you who haven't attended The Magic Castle, I'll paint as accurate a picture of my experience as I can so you can live vicariously through my review. And for those who have had the pleasure of being invited, feel free to chime in or give your two cents as well.First off, you need to be invited by a card carrying magician or employee of the establishment. It can be random, but the invite process is pretty selective from what I hear. The dress code is strictly business casual/formal. If you read up on it, they treat it as a classy establishment, so dress to impress. They have a strict no photography rule once you enter the main area, so keep that in mind. Parking situation is valet, so as soon as you go up the hill... you'll see the guys and you just hand them your keys and go on your merry way. As soon as you get to the front door, just give the name of your party or whoever invited you and you should be able to get through. Make sure you have $15 on hand.You'll enter a lobby area with a front desk surrounded by bookcases and a small gift shop. There's a $25 entrance fee just to get in... so you'll already be $40 down at this point. Once you get through the bookcase with the magic owl, just walk through the hallway and there will be a giant bar area and even bigger lobby with all the attendees. I honestly thought there would be less crowded given that it was an exclusive club, but I think it was like over 200 people or so.You'll be directed upward to the dining area which kinda reminds me of a magician's version of Lawry's. Very classic and upscale, so my suggestion would be to not order anything too messy. Their signature cocktails are a work of art! Order one and you will definitely have a great time for the rest of the night. I had the Australian Rack of Lamb, which I would say was the winner of the evening! Everyone in my party ordered the Prime Rib or the Beef Wellington, which were both exceptional... but the lamb exceeded my expectations! Delicious, flavorful, and depending on how you ask for it to be cooked... just amazing. For dessert, I would suggest their famous Banana Cream Pie or their Molten Chocolate Cake. Just suggestions, but I enjoyed them very much. The magic show... without spoiling too much of it, there is a different lineup every day, so right after dinner... you'll go downstairs to the lobby area where the room is open for you to enter. Find a seat and enjoy the show! And by the time you know it, it's already midnight!Definitely a place worth visiting if the opportunity presents itself, but be prepared! Come with a heavy wallet and a dress-to-impress attitude and you will have a great time!",4 star rating
31,11/3/2019,"No better place to dress up, enjoy the magic and spend time with friends. Dinner wasn't much to write home about, but we're all here for the magicians right? From card tricks to illusionists, the Magic Castle showcases a wide variety of talent. We were lucky enough to see some international talent from Japan last year who did some amazing puppetry work. Every visit has a different set of magicians. You don't know what to expect when you come here, and that's part of the joy. Loving the no photography policy, as it puts you more in the moment. At the end of the day, it's a fabulous opportunity to spend with friends, you get the chance to personally connect to performers and just enjoy the night.",5 star rating
32,9/15/2019,"We went to a matinee at the Magic Castle where the acts were all kid-friendly, but not juvenile. We saw shows in three theaters, each with different performers. Two of the three theaters had outstanding performers, and I'm frankly not necessarily a fan of magic tricks, but they were seriously entertaining, fun to watch, and extremely talented. The third theater was geared toward smaller kids, and it was definitely slower paced than the other rooms. There are also close-up magicians at small tables throughout the venue, and you can stop and watch them in between going to the theater shows. The venue itself is quite interesting, and you really need to pay attention to everything. Many things are not simply as they appear, including artwork, the phone booth, the piano, etc. We ate at the buffet brunch (required for the kind of tickets we had), and they had a very nice spread, where we indulged in bottomless mimosas, eggs Benedict, shrimp cocktail, crab legs, fruit, pastries, chicken nuggets, macaroni and cheese, and ice cream. They have a dress code, which differs between matinee and evening shows (no shorts, jeans, t-shirts). The parking is valet only, and I believe the fee was $15.If you're fortunate enough to get tickets to go to the Magic Castle, you're sure to have a great time!",5 star rating

34,9/30/2018,"Review #700: The Magic Castle!  The exclusive, need a connection to get in, mansion in Hollywood.I've tried to bid on their tickets at a fundraiser for 2 consecutive years but they were just too popular to outbid.You need to know someone who knows a magician and get you in. The exterior is very impressive. As you arrive there is a step and repeat where you can take photos like a celeb and a water fountain. They make sure your name is on the list and then you go into a lobby area that looks like a library to check in, and can also browse the gift shop. We paid $25 per person for admission, $15 for valet parking.Then they give you the magic words so a secret door opens and lets you in.We went up the stairs to our charming dining room. The walls are decorated with los of posters about magicians and other things.Our server was still training and very good.  I didn't have high expectations of the food due to the reviews so I was pleasantly surprised. We had:*Fried calamari*Four cheese garlic bread*Beef Wellington with mashed potatoes, carrots and broccolini ($47) + mushroom sauce $4*Hubby got the Tomahawk special ($79)Both beef dishes were very tender! The tomahawk could have used a bit more salt.  My beef wellington was very good.Our dinner started at 8pm and then we had tickets to the 10pm 45-minute show in the main room, the Palace of Mystery.  They said it was recently upgraded with new lights though the decor looked a bit tacky.  We were entertained by 3 magicians: Robert Ramirez, Michael Rayner and Naathan Phan. All acts were pretty funny and entertaining. Most tricks were pretty new to me although I have not seen many magic shows.  Some were more like ""how can he do that?"" vs an optical illusion.All other smaller shows are first come first serve and it was a bit hard to find them.We went to the Parlour of Prestidigitation to see a 15-20 min show by BJ Hickman. The theater was small but very elegant. His tricks were more of the classic ones I've seen before but still entertaining.There are also magicians doing more interactive card shows just outside of the theaters.Unfortunately, they do not allow pics inside so I opted to obey the rules and enjoy which was great.If you can get tickets, definitely go!!!!!!",5 star rating
35,9/25/2019,I gotta up the reviews!I've been again (a couple times)and it was a whole new experience.I felt like the temperature is much better and the shows were better.The main show was also alot better.I made sure to sit not too close and not too far.There was a time it was too close from the side and you can kinda see what's going on which spoils the whole thing.Also its fun to be part of the show too.I was called up a couple times and it really fun. HahaLast couple times I went they had a backdrop where you can take photos so that was good since they dont allow you to take photos inside.,4 star rating
36,10/26/2019,"The Magic Castle is truly a one-of-a-kind experience. They do a unique job of weaving magic into a fancy evening out. Go as early as you can, and start with drinks as you wait for one of the up close shows. We had the pleasure of seeing Paul Roffman who was excellent and extremely funny. This ""James Bond of Magic"" was our entertainment highlight of the night. Full bar with decent beer and wine selections. Drinks are fairly priced and served throughout the castle; there are multiple bars (sometimes complete with entertainment) and attentive servers.  The restaurant was pricey but nearly everything we ate was excellent so I recommend including dining with your Magic Castle visit. We opted for formal table service but others enjoyed food at the bar. Dinner gave us tickets to an appropriately timed stage show that included 3 entertainment acts with very different styles. My biggest disappointment was that several of the walls were covered in black plastic sheets in preparation for their Halloween events. It was like being in a building under construction and we were denied the experience of viewing whatever is usually behind those walls. Plus the plastic sheets were creepy in what is supposed to be an elegant setting.Be sure to read about their strict dress code and bring ID, no matter your age.",4 star rating
37,2/26/2020,"Food was Immaculate. The magic shows in each room were amazing let alone the story of the architecture and retrofitting. (It's amazing and adds a character all to its own.)The castle seems somewhat like a Charlie Chaplin house in a way. ""Where more really is more."" The decor expresses just this. Luxury, history, story and magic. A place of Aw. Not only are the management and service practically family at times they exchange rolls I hear! Extremely fascinating. ""If someone feels left out they won't laugh or be part of the tricks, that's just unacceptable you see."" -PR One of the most interesting and unique place i have come across in the World.Dress in 10s*Best attire in your closet. I'd stay close to a Knight/ Rep in the castle at all times. (Pay close attention to the jackets & pins) Magicians tend to dress the same on the floor. Our Knight & host made our night unexpectedly; one of the most amazing nights of our lives.It was spectacular. Great owners I might add.Side Note: Ladies Br needs a remodel.",5 star rating
38,11/4/2019,"I have lived within a mile or two of the Magic Castle for 30 years now and I finally went a few Saturdays ago.   You need to be ""invited"" - we were a group of 4.  You cannot takes pictures inside, so take your photos at the entrance.  My friend didn't know she couldn't take pictures and took one at one of bars, she was reprimanded.There's valet parking - otherwise, if you park down the street, it's a rather steep climb.  We used lyft to save us trouble - expect to be there for 4 to 5 hours.There's also a dress code.  It says formal but they don't mean black tie and gowns.  Men have to be in suits or the formal native ware for foreigners and women have to be dressed up - no pants.There's a Minimum/entrance charge of $30/person if you have dinner reservations.  If you don't want to have dinner, then the entrance fee is $70 or $75.  Dinner entrees are $40+ - so you might as well have dinner.Come at least 30 minutes before your dinner reservations (ours was at 6pm) so you can explore the very interesting building.  The building is the best part of the whole experience.  There are bars every where and they are trying to sell you drinks as much as possible......even our waiter all throughout dinner kept trying to push drinks on us - to me this was a turn off.The food was traditional and good.  I had the Beef Wellington - when was the last time you saw that in a menu? My friends had roast beef and salmon.  They offered us cheese bread and that was really good and asked for another basket but didn't realize it $8/order till we got the bill.It's like an adult amusement park - you're overpaying for everything.You're entitled to one show in a small auditorium with your dinner reservation but you don't get to pick, they assign it to you.  If you want to catch any other show, you have to follow their schedule and wait in the corded area - again, just like an amusement park.  Or you can go to one of the many bars where the bar tender is a magician and performs for the crowd.  There are also Radom tables where a magician is sitting by themselves waiting for anyone to approach them.  The Magic performances were amazing but nothing extraordinary.It's a great concept, but I'm not sure if it's worth over $100/person.  I'm glad I went, it was fun - doing it once is enough.",3 star rating
39,1/3/2019,"Definitely a place to visit once. I was super curious to come and check it out after driving by it many times. My expectations were not too high as I had heard from several people that unless you really like magic it's probably not a big deal and that is exactly how I left feeling. The place looks nice from the outside, once inside you can tell it was really beautiful at some point but in current need of some updating. The restaurant service was a 3/5. The food was ok with a couple of vegetarian options. The magic shows themselves were cool to watch but only two of them were really entertaining.

41,8/28/2019,"I was invited here for dinner for a friend's birthday not knowing anything about it beside you need to dress up. I am so happy I went and got to experience the shows and dinner. I came on a Thursday early evening for  a 6 pm dinner reservation. Traffic getting there was awful, we were planning to get there 15 minutes early but ended up getting there on time. Thankfully we did not get lost or we would have definitely been late. When we arrived we valeted our car and waited in a line to check in.  You are not allowed to take pictures inside so we spent some time taking pictures. After checking in we went directly to our dinner reservation upstairs. The tables were so close together and it felt really cozy. I ordered steak and vegetables and it was good. It was an expensive dinner but the service and quality were worth it. If you have leftovers they check it so you can walk around and catch a show without carrying your food everywhere. You can also walk around with your drink so you can take your time and enjoy the evening. We watched two shows after dinner and I could have totally stayed longer if I didn't have work the next day. I definitely want to come back on the weekend so I catch more shows and lounge in different areas.",5 star rating
42,8/30/2018,"I was not a big fan of magic until The Magic Castle. I have been three times now and each visit is unique and wonderful. The magicians change on a daily to monthly basis and come from around the world. The shows are pretty hard to describe -- you have to see it to believe it and even then the shows are mind-boggling, especially their ""slight of hand"" line-up. Their performances really leave you wondering how they were able to make a fish bowl (with water) come out of a paper bag that was flat just moments ago or read your mind using cards(sounds strange but I've experienced it!). Reservations should be made weeks, if not months, in advance. Sometimes openings that are sooner pop up but I usually have to book my party far ahead of time. Valet only (15), and depending on how you got invited, there is a cover charge that changes based on day of the week (30-45). Also based on invite, you might have to purchase a dinner (I think it was a 40 minimum?). If you do eat dinner, here (food is great/see below) then you get a complimentary ticket to the ""big"" main magic show which is about 45min-hour. The other shows are smaller and more frequent. If you don't have a ticket to the main show, you'll end up in the back or not get a spot. Usually the main show is a hit (I've been to one that was a bit disappointing) but the smaller performances in the private rooms are just as good IMO. The food that I've had here is delicious. I've had a few of their salads, each huge enough to be a dinner in and of itself. I highly recommend the Houdini Prime Rib -- it is enormous and very tender (pictured). The chili-coffee braised pork osso bucco is also pretty unique and I've only been able to find it here. There is only one vegetarian option which is a pasta (but there are salads). The strawberry mousse is the best dessert here by far out of their three options.  The Castle has a lot of stairs and small nooks and crannies. It can get hard to navigate. Also note there is a strict dress code which you can find on their site. They ask people to leave if not dressed formally. Make sure to visit Irma, this ghost that plays a piano. If you talk to the piano -- I mean, Imra -- then she'll play whatever song you request (I've given her some tough songs) and she responds to your statements via piano keys. Pretty neat.They lose a star because some of the magicians who play on the side (in the nooks and crannies/not listed on the schedule pamphlet) have been incredibly rude. It also costs an arm and a leg here and the experience can start to get repetitive if you come more than once. I have only ever come on weekdays (not Friday-Sunday) because even on a Wednesday night, it is crowded, but not too bad. I imagine that weekends are horridly stuffed with people and very busy. I like to sit in the front and I've heard food is subpar when they are busy during weekends.My favorite performance was when they asked my boyfriend to be a volunteer that colored in a picture using different colors (of my BF's choosing). When my BF was finished, the magician pulled out the object in the colored picture from a hat exactly the same colors as the way my BF had colored the picture. Despite the couple cons, I have had fun on all my visits here.",4 star rating
43,2/24/2020,"The Magic Castle is a curious establishment - an iconic Los Angeles landmark known for treating its members and their guests to wondrous evenings inclusive of fine dining, crafted cocktails and yes, lots of magic. If you're lucky enough to snag an invite, take the opportunity and go. We unfortunately didn't get the chance to experience the dining room, but the menu looked excellent and cocktail/bar service was top notch at each of the Castle's watering holes. One bar even spots a bar tending magician if you're lucky enough to be there when he is. Multiple parlors run set scheduled shows with different magicians and mentalists but some of the real magic at The Magic Castle comes when you least expect it.World class mentalist and member Michael Gutenplan gave us a spontaneous tour of the castle over a glass of wine, offering some insight into the buildings eclectic history and sharing stories with a whimsical charismatic charm. He made us feel extremely welcomed and appeared genuinely happy to be sharing some magic with us. Walking from parlor to parlor is also an adventure on its own and the amount of spontaneous magic you may encounter between rooms is substantial. A piano lounge within features a resident musician you won't want to miss.The dress code is important to follow. Please keep that in mind.",5 star rating
44,7/22/2019,"Came on a Sunday night with an 8 PM dinner reservation for a party of 6.First of all, I had stress acne from trying to figure out the dress code all week. There was a ton of traffic because of the Hollywood bowl.We got there at 7 and were able to watch one magic show before dinner, and it was AMAZING. Really clever and done well, and the magician was very charismatic and personable. We went upstairs for dinner, which was super busy. We didn't get our menus until after a good 15 minutes into being seated. I checked the menu ahead of time and knew I wanted the beef Wellington, but they were out of it!!!! I was so disappointed. I got their lobster special for $74. I didn't think it was worth the hefty price tag to be honest. Lobster was seasoned fine, but I didn't like the garlic mashed potatoes (no texture, lacking in depth of flavor) and broccoli I was just okay. We also got:Lemon pepper calamari - just ok. Not particularly crunchy. Sauces weren't memorable. Hush puppies - decent, but very rich and oily. As in, it tastes like the fry oil saturated the entire piece of cornbread. We each had one, which was enough. Mac and cheese with crab: good amount of crab, not very cheesy at all needed some sriracha or other flavor. Cheesy garlic bread: they say it's their most popular item but I could've bought an entire loaf of the same thing at Whole Foods for a quarter of the price. I thought it would be more special than it was. The main magic show and the subsequent show I watched after were both kind of rickety and seemed kind of played out. You clearly do not come here for the food, but I wish I caught some better magic shows to make up for the lacking meal. P.S. If you want a Friday or Saturday slot, book months in advance!",3 star rating
45,10/22/2018,"UPDATED: We came back in June 2018 for the Saturday brunch! Food was excellent. Magic shows entertaining especially when my kids were pulled into one of them. We especially enjoyed Irma who played practically any song I conjured up. Happy to have been able to experience the Magic Castle!!Our Magic Castle experience was different from most. We booked through my Alma mater's group event with 5 tickets with 3 being under 21. We booked this months before and reserved flights and a hotel in Hollywood.Upon arrival, we were informed it was 21 and over only. Yes it says that on the website, but our group host never said under 21 were not allowed through the group. Multiple emails back and forth and no mention of this. So sad a simple miscommunication could cause such a potentially terrible experience. But Joey and the Magic Castle staff were so nice! They had two magicians come out to us in the lobby and perform a few card tricks. They gave us an option to come back during brunch, so now we can plan another lalala adventure for the summer.We aren't happy with our Alma mater group, but the Magic Castle staff is top notch! Thank you Magic Castle for your hospitality.",5 star rating

All of the staff is lovely and the food has improved greatly since our first visit in 2002. It is truly a treasure trove to be experienced and shared.

50,1/10/2019,"I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to witness the Magic Castle. This private estate is by invitation only. Upon entering the lounge, you will need to find a secret doorway to the castle and say the magic word. There is a sense of old Hollywood magic roaming inside the Castle. It's a spectacular place.  I highly recommend checking out close-up magic. It's a complete mind-bending experience. If you ever get a chance to befriend a magician, ask if they are a member. Also, Magic Castle is a fantastic place to bring a date.  Occasionally, you can spot celebrities, but I am horrible with faces. Maybe I did run into one unnoticed, or perhaps not.  Few tips to remember:- Admission fee Friday to Saturday was $30 per person.- Valet $15- They have a strict dress code so make sure to read their disclosures. - Heavy pour on drinks. Be responsible. - Arrive early. Shows last all evening and as late as midnight. - Show up on time for dinner. Entrees start at $40.- Explore the castle and search for unscheduled magic shows.",5 star rating
51,3/1/2020,"Had the pleasure of going to the Magic Castle last night for the 2nd time where I saw John Kippen and Bill Joslin perform again. It's hard to see all the shows at the Castle in one night due to the lines - esp on weekends- but seeing the intimate magic shows I think is even better, such as John and Bill's. In my mind that is where true magic occurs- right in front of your eyes! - and more impressive than the main shows. I love John and Bill's personal stories and their passion for magic. You can tell John just wants to wow you and make you smile! Even seeing both shows the 2nd time I still couldn't figure out how they did any of their tricks- ask John for the Monopoly money trick!! If you are at the Castle- try to find them and ask them to perform for you. You won't regret it!!!",5 star rating
52,1/20/2020,"I love magic.I really love magic.I also sometimes like having an excuse to get all dressed to the nines and enjoying an evening out with good company, talented magicians, and quality food.The website outlines exactly what attire is expected from the guests, so being judged on what you're wearing is thus also expected. People talking about not being let in or feeling awkward due to what they were wearing have no one to blame but themselves. I haven't had any issues.This is clearly a ""secretive"" and exclusive place, but if you befriend any of the magicians, you're sure to be able to ask them for invites. I have met and gotten to know quite a few of them. They're really awesome people, and very talented! I love walking through and seeing the various acts going on. There are little rooms for close-up and more theatrical magic, and I highly recommend lining up early for them, as seating is very, very limited.Drinks aren't bad here, either. The NPH is mysteriously strong, as it made my friend, who drinks heavily, quite tipsy after just two (and very drunk by 4). The Magical Moment is also very flavorful, and my female friend really enjoyed it (as did I, when I tried it).It is lamentable that dinner is required for non-members, but at least it's pretty decent food. I would give the food a solid 4 stars as well. Their hidden menu item (Tomahawk steak) is quite delicious, and their infinite au jus is much appreciated (I basically drink the stuff).Keep in mind there is an entrance fee, and valet is pretty much required unless you take a rideshare.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because to me 5 stars means a completely satisfying experience bar none, every single time, where everything is perfect. And I gave the Magic Castle 4 stars because Yelp doesn't let you give 4.8 stars. This, of course, is in comparison to other ""Magic Castle""-like places out there, which there are few, so it's held to expectations of what a place like this should be like. That being said, the Magic Castle is pretty much the best-in-class. I love this place.",4 star rating

55,6/22/2019,"Bucket list: Magic Castle.... Check. What an amazing evening. My friend and I felt like we were transported back in time. Loved the dress code (they legit refused people at the door and told them to borrow a jacket from their supply of left-behind or old jackets), and the no pictures/video rules. I feel like this is how all experiences should be - living in the moment and appreciating the Art and respecting the venue. But don't worry, you can take pics outside at the MC wall or right when you walk inside to the lobby to pay for your entrance fee. There are several floors and rooms, so get curious and start exploring! Earlier in the evening (like at 5pm), go to the Close Up Gallery, or visit Irma before she gets too crowded. Do as many things before your dinner reservation bc later into the evening, it gets PACKED! We had dinner reservations at 6pm. We had: 1. Cheesy bread: it's bread w cheese and garlic. Enough said. 2. Calamari: so good. There's also some sort of veggie on top and it was delicious. 3. Beef Wellington: my first time having this and it was soooo tender and delicious. 4. Lamb: this was also good. By this time we were so full and couldn't finish everything. 5. Mac and cheese w crab: um also so delicious. And crab is a must. Nice chunks of crab. Not too cheesy and heavy! We got to watch several shows and had to stand in line for like 40 minutes to see our last 11:15 showing. But there's enough to entertain you even if you don't go inside all the stages- magicians are all over the castle and the drinks are fantastic, so just relax and enjoy!! I'd explain more, but honestly there's so much fun in exploring here... you just gotta experience it for yourself!",5 star rating
56,3/3/2019,"Late review. Came here before and really enjoyed the various magic acts. They are really strict with dress code. My friends mom had a zippered cardigan but those weren't allowed so she had to walk several blocks to a store and buy a blazer. The other guy in our group also had to go and buy a blazer because his top wasn't formal enough. We read the dress code very carefully before we went but I guess they were very strict. So that wasn't good. We had to pay entrance fee and on top of that extra wardrobe, valet fee, and tip. You can only take photos outside and in lobby area but that's it. Inside was pretty interesting. Lots to see and plenty of magic shows to enjoy. When you find a show you have to plan it eight because there's always a line of people also wanting to see it so you can't see all the shows. They have set dinner times so groups of people can dine at different intervals. I ordered the beef Wellington which was delicious. Drinks were good too but food service came very slow and drinks were rarely refilled.  Restaurant was nicely decorated though with right seating. It's hard being a curvy girls and sitting in tight spots. Let's just say overall fun experience. Just have to remember to bring a lot of cash on hand and also be prepared to spend money upfront just getting into magic castle. Lastly you have to know someone to get invited here. You have to email a magician and when they invite you then you can arrange for time to visit. If you are patient and plan months ahead then you will have a good time.",3 star rating
57,3/3/2020,"Great evening and my entire group had so much fun! They are very kind but won't let you drop your tie...very formal. However, when I was eating they didn't seem to mind too much as I am more comfortable eating without a tie during that time. Much appreciated.The magic we saw this trip didn't get closed to my first experience at the Palace of Mystery but that's why they rotate in all the talent. Can't wait to see who is next... They brought in the talents from ""America's Got Talent"" or people who can fool the infamous Penn and Teller on my last two trips.I love that you never see the same people twice!!! Highly recommend.The staff was so kind to shuttle us from performance to performance with minimal waiting time. Amazing staff!The Beef Wellington, Tomahawk Steak...Prime Ribs all had major rave reviews from everyone!!! Nobody in my group spoke highly of the duck pasta and my salmon didn't work. I didn't mind as we were being hurried into the Palace for the last show. Next time I might get an earlier reservation so we can see more.So grateful we went again as my entire birthday party loved experiencing the mystery and culture of cutting edge Magic.I do wish they would have given out a piece of cake at the end of our meal.

When I realized Doc was the same Doc (20 years late rat the now Library Bar [then, W.C. Feilds]) we connected and that has been a true honor. and... well anyway, what a absolutely phenomenal community.Anyway, it's crazy how fast I became the magician in all of my circles - then I auditioned 04/06/2015 and have been a proud member ever since.",5 star rating

60,3/5/2018,"This is one of my all time favorite Los Angeles experiences!! I love it because it's exclusive (typical LA) but only for the purpose of helping magicians build relationships with their audience and keep the ""magic"" alive. I love the concept that you cannot get in without an invite from a magician. You also cannot take any pictures once inside the mansion. This is a strict rule. The pics I did get were allowed out front and in the lobby where you check in. We started off our evening by saying the magic words (not ""please"") to open a secret door that lead into a large bar area. Once in, we were treated to ""live"" piano tunes where a friendly ghost took requests. Then we caught a couple of side acts in the close-up theater. The close-up theater was a great experience. It was an intimate time with the magicians where if you watch closely enough, you can start to figure out how the magic happens. Lots of audience participation. Then, on to our dinner reservation. This meal was amazing!! We loved the appetizers, main dishes were on point, steaks couldn't be more tender, I seriously cannot day enough good things about this meal. We loved it! The only thing that made the meal better was the service. Wonderful, prompt attentive service really sealed the deal. The onto the main stage for a trio of magic performances that blew me away! I had no idea how creative and artistic magicians can be.  But the fun didn't stop there...we were able to catch two more acts in two additional theaters (this truly is a castle because there were so many theaters we did not have time to visit them all!) as well as mix it up with some magicians who were just hanging out. We made many connections and were glad to know that anytime we wanted any invite back, we could just call on one of our new magicians friends for an invite!!",5 star rating
61,12/22/2017,"Can't think of a more appropriate name, it's a castle and there's magic inside. I've heard about the MC years ago, but never knew in details what it is, nor can I try to picture it by friend's description. First, here are some useful notes about this place. * You cannot simply walk in, and you cannot make a reservation either. * You'll need to know someone who is already a member or a magician to gain entry. * If the member walks in with you, there's no cover charge. But if the member puts you on the guest list but doesn't walk in with you, it's $30.00. * Formal attire, no exceptions. Men in suits at all times, and ladies .. well, ladies tend to look better than men. But do dress up. * No photos beyond the small lobby. They are very strict so don't be the rebel & try to snap photos. *  Valet only. $13.00 fee is paid inside by cash or credit, but have some bills for tip afterwards. On to my evening. Recently, we received an invite to come here on a Saturday night. Our new magician friend met us at the door and walked us in. Inside is a cashier station for purchases at the small gift shop or pay for parking. You can also check in your coat here. Face the wall of books and say the magic words, the wall will reveal a secret door. If you're invited, you'll know what the words are. Through the door into the first room is a bar. Off to the right are stairs that lead to the dining room and bigger shows. To the left is where you can line up for another magic show which happens about every 20 min., and they rotate magicians. That area also has staircases that leads you downstairs to other rooms. Behind the bar is a nice seating area for medium sized groups. A great place to have a drink before seeing the acts. You can also order food and have it brought over to the cocktail tables. Guests are free to roam, mingle or just see magicians randomly perform throughout the castle. The bigger and better acts take place later in to the night, as the crowds roll in. Most of the acts we experienced allow guests to sit up close & personal, and the magicians often include them as part of the act. Some are noticeably better than others but all incorporate humor into their acts. The Magic Castle is a fun, but classy place to go with a date, a group or even for a special occasion. It's a very different experience.Side notes: *If you are able to get in, dinner will require a reservation ... and will allow you gain access to the big acts at night. Inquire with the Magic Castle for details. * There are a couple of ambassadors with white badges that will offer tours of the castle. They are super friendly and have a great sense of humor.",5 star rating

The food was so much better than I had heard beforehand. My food was really good, I recommend the banana cream pie for dessert. My friends and I had a blast exploring.

63,4/29/2018,"This is a Disneyland for adults, minus the fast passes and cream cheese filled pretzels. Nonetheless, THE MAGIC CASTLE IS MAGICAL. I suggest not going in trying to figure everything out and, instead, embrace your inner child. Embrace a little mystery. I especially enjoyed the close-up magic tricks from the magicians just hanging out in the lobby areas. Favorite show was downstairs in the dungeon area. FANTASTIC showmanship. Also, loved requesting music from Irma. For the reserved dinner, I had prime rib with mashed potatoes and seasoned vegetables, prepared medium. It was satisfying, not too much to make me feel like I wanted to peel over and sleep, so I'm glad I didn't go overboard. Only alcohol I had was a Pinot Grigio, but was given such a generous serving that I felt it was enough. Overall, the castle is kind of a maze inside, but it adds to the magic feel. Since we went on a Saturday, there was a bunch more folks - so I'd like to experience the castle during the week days instead. I'm now trying to figure out my way back in....",5 star rating

My bosses were invited by a member and we had a lovely dinner and were able to enjoy some of the shows. My dinner was super delicious. I had the prime rib along with a side of mash potatoes, veggies and butternut squash. My favorite item inside the mansion was Irma the haunted piano. She was hidden inside the mansion so we had to ask to find out where she was. We were able to see two shows and before we knew It we had been at the Magic Castle for five hours.

Our bill was around $600, it was a pure waste. This place name themselves as a premium steak house. Omg, it was such a bad dining experience.Drinks were bad as well, they poured me old fashioned from a barrel pre-made, throw ice and serve directly to me. No taste no flavor-nothing. I would get a better drink at any low end pub. Not recommended. Stay away from Fake Hype about this place.Service sucks! Staff was very rude!",1 star rating
66,9/7/2019,"Had a great time here, though a couple of things took me by surprise. First was the entrance fee; fie on me for not doing the research, I was told entrance was complimentary, but you had to order $50 for dinner, but it was $35 entrance fee and $50 dinner (minimum order of entree starting at 29, average 38, plus tax & tip; i've heard there's possibility to order apps and other stuff, as long as it's over $30, but I wouldn't bank on it), but for a night filled with magic and entertainment, totally worth.The second thing that took me by surprise is the viciousness of the people in line. We had stood in line for about 20-25 minutes at the living-room magic show before 3 of our party decided to pick up some drinks at the bar, cause it was still 20 minutes before showtime. Unfortunately, 5 minutes in, the line started moving, and I went to retrieve the peeps at the bar; when we tried to get back to where we were, there was serious outcry of rage from the other attendees. A lot of ""come on!"" and ""unbelievable."" (true to form, though, the crowd at Magic Castle is predominantly entitled WASPs) When we did manage to get to where we were, the staff were also adamant that ""this is not how things work here,"" as in one person can save a seat for one person, but not for four people. The frustrating thing is that we didn't just send one person to hold the spot while we gallivanted around the castle; we were all in line together until the poorly timed decision to buy a drink for the next 20 minutes of waiting. Suffice to say, if a waiter doesn't come by to offer you bar service, you're better off not buying. Plus, the drinks are all around $15 anyways. So, maybe you're better off not buying period lol. Food is hit or miss; out of the three things I bought: Vegetarian entree, spinach madeline, and garlic bread, the garlic bread was the best. Tried some chicken and steak off of other people; nothing impressive (and to the friend with the beef wellington, extremely disappointing).The saving grace to our night was Joseph Gabriel. Seeing that many birds pulled in one man's act... magical; the crowd got more and more enthusiastic with each bird, and then his grand finale got a full ovation. So, with dinner, entrance, & valet, you're spending about $100 for entertainment; it's cheaper than entrance to one park at Disney and the lines are shorter.",4 star rating

First things first: read the website carefully, as it explains the dress code, entrance requirements, and so on, quite well. You need to be a member or have an invitation from a member in order to enter. Everyone is required to wear formal attire, which contributes to the charmingly retro and festive atmosphere inside. In many of the rooms, you feel like you're in a speakeasy or at a fancy mid-century cocktail party. There are several settings with scheduled performances, as well as areas for close-up illusions scattered throughout the social areas. There are several formal dining rooms upstairs serving somewhat retro food: big steaks, big chops, and a wonderful seafood pasta (which I had, with huge lumps of crab meat, scallops, and prawns). The pistachio crème brûlée was my favorite of the desserts. The main performance at the upstairs theater requires separate tickets, and was well worth it.",5 star rating

They also have a bunch of mini shows throughout the castle and performers come out every 20 minutes or so. I'm always impressed by the acts and I love the audience participation.

70,5/19/2019,"If the Magic Castle isn't on your bucket list, it should be!  This is quite possibly the most unique ""evening out"" experience I've had in my entire adult life.This is a private club, but you can usually find tickets at charity auctions (assume you'll spend about $125 per ticket, based on the two separate times I've bid and won tickets in a silent auction).All guests are required to have dinner (about $50 per person), but after that, you are free to roam the facility. There are countless rooms and bars that have performers ready to dazzle you. Highly suggest going with a group.My only criticisms of the place are the weak drinks and assembly line food. But beyond that, everything about the Magic Castle is simply magical. Notes:- Dress code is strictly enforced.

I heard good things, but again, it was average and compared to a good Steak place... For the price I'd much rather have gone to a 4 diamond restaurant...If you're into magic, give it a shot.

72,3/23/2018,"The magic castle was amazing! I had a really enjoyable time. If you're a fan of magic you will love this place. I went in a group of 6 and it was the perfect size. I saw Chuck Jones & Company and David Gabbay. They were both incredible magicians and the illusions they were creating were out of this world. The castle is such a unique place where you can enjoy dinner and a show. They have a strict no photography rule after the lobby but I snuck a photo of my food in case vegan people were interested in seeing what kind of food they had. Mine was some kind of organic tofu dish with some sauce. It was alright, not the best meal but I can't complain and I was just glad they had a vegan option to begin with. If you're looking for a good time then I highly recommend coming here. Everyone here was in good spirits and the overall energy was very positive. Their employees are really strict on their castle policies so don't try to be shady or get away with anything that they've specified on multiple signs throughout the castle! Grab a drink, eat a meal, and enjoy the magic.",5 star rating
73,1/1/2018,Magic.  It can all be explained with science but it's much more fun to sit in awe and wonder.  This place is amazing!  There is magic around every corner.  The up close and personal magic in some of the smaller rooms is just as good as what goes on at the main theatre room.  And there are magicians tucked away in the hallways and lobbies as well.Great place to visit with friend and neighbors!,5 star rating
74,12/11/2019,"Can't comment much on food aside from Impossible Burger I had at a bar downstairs/or up, who knows how this maze of a place works.1. It was close to impossible to wrangle an invite on an incredibly short notice of two days. You must know someone. Thankfully I got in and had an amazing time with my friends, one of my favorite memories of all time really.2. The number of attractive people here is shockingly high. Dressed up to the nines and just naturally good-looking. Unexpected, I wonder if this is how life was decades ago, people put together, thin and sophisticated. 3. I can't imagine it being cheap for those that drink. I don't partake so not sure how that pricing was.4. All around fun and unique experience going from show to show and room to room. I can't wait to be back and spend more time exploring. Being with cool, curious company is key. Leave toxic people out, this is a place to really experience with your five senses and pay attention. If you have mental issues don't ruin the perhaps once in a lifetime experience for others. Leave drama at the door. Still not sure how the magician roast works or if there were random magicians sprinkled in the club and why, but it seemed like it. Intriguing.Sadly no pictures to show but still very fresh in my memory.",4 star rating
75,3/8/2019,"Would it be too cheesy of me to say that this place is MAGICAL?!?Truth be told, this place really is a lot of fun. The ambiance combined with the magicians really come together to provide everyone within a super fun night out away from the regular world. I thoroughly enjoyed all the shows, the many rooms and parlors, you never really knew what was around the corner!Dinner is above average. If based on dinner alone, You'd be a little disappointed. But come on now, you're not coming to the magic castle just to eat a Beef Wellington. I recommend visiting this place if given the opportunity to anyone",5 star rating
76,11/7/2019,"I was lucky enough to be invited by a dear friend and that part was lovely, but the hype surrounding this establishment was quickly challenged the second I walked through the door. In typical LA fashion, the ""members club"" status has given it an unnecessary ""hot spot"" pin-drop and the dress code expectations for the experience is a serious mismatch. The best members clubs in the world, Annabels in London, 5 Hertford,  various Soho Houses, don't have some of these requirements and give you a clean, chic and elevated experience in return.The Breakdown:Venue: The venue has an old, musty feeling that reminded us of a Disney haunted castle. The photos on the wall were cheesy and the place was dark and felt dusty, even if it wasn't.Food: The brunch buffet was nice but the service was really terrible. The server forgot drinks, knocked things over and asked the same question of two of our guests over 3 times.Magic: We expected some really impressive acts but we got a children's hour (at one point, literally).Staff: Most were nice but a couple were aggressive. Poking a guest (me) on the shoulder and pointing me away from a line is just odd.If it were not so pretentious in its demands and not pretending to be something it's not, it could have been a fun and cheesy day out, but the place is not worth the attitude or the hype. Spend your money and efforts to get in elsewhere.",2 star rating
77,10/6/2019,"This was an experience unlike any other. It was amazing coming here and I hope to come again soon! The Castle has a strict dress code, so make sure to read it before coming. You also can't take any pictures inside, and yes they strictly enforce this. If you are able to, I would recommend coming on a weeknight or Sunday night. I came on a Sunday night and it wasn't too difficult to get into any of the shows, all though they did all fill up eventually. The magic shows are absolutely insane. Even sitting a few feet away, I didn't figure out how they did any of the tricks. Drinks are allowed inside the theater, and they will even take your order before the show starts and then brings it to you. I got here around 5PM and didn't leave until 11PM, and I still wish I had been able to spend a few more hours here.As for the food, the menu has a lot of options, even a few gluten free and vegan options. Appetizers are in the $15-25 range and entrees are $40-60. I ordered the smoked salmon sourdough ($21) as an appetizer and the seafood pasta dish ($42, can't remember the exact name!) as an entree. I really enjoyed all the toppings on the sourdough, smoked salmon, avocado, burrata, and caviar were all great, but the bread itself was kind of stale. Came with 4 pretty decent sized pieces, so more than enough to share. The pasta dish was huge! The sea urchin and lump crab were really good and tasted fresh. The pasta itself seemed a little dry and the entire thing and a big layer of cheese over it that I thought was too much. I also got the banana cream pie ($12) for dessert, which was delicious and enough for a few people to share.",5 star rating

You are allowed to have your phone, but not to take pictures or video of the establishment. You will have to dress as if you were attending a Gala or a fancy dinner. Men please be in a suit and tie, although a tux would be perfection. Ladies be sure to wear a lovely gown. The place has a dress code, and you will not be allowed in if the requirements aren't met. You also have to get an invite by a magician that is a member of the castle. You cannot gain access unless you are on the list, invited, and escorted in my the magician.

Don't risk getting a ticket by parking around the neighborhood, don't learn the hard way. If you are cheap like me, pre-drink at some cool dive bars Hollywood has to offer and then arrive here. Hang out after the show to watch some magicians practice some cool tricks they perform at other locations. Do try to get picked when they need someone from the crowd. Honestly I thought it was ""fake or staged"" and that the volunteer was in on it.After my fiancée was chosen and the look on his face was shocked when the magician knew something he had chosen, we changed our minds!

82,11/5/2017,"Visited 7/15/2017I've always wanted to come here and I was so lucky to get invited!!  TY Tora!!  It almost felt like a yelp event because most of the people I went with were all yelpers!Parking is valet, so if you are lucky enough to get an invite, try to carpool.Entrance fee is $30.  I highly recommend getting there early and leaving when they close so that you get your monies worth plus there's so many magic shows you must see!!The very first show that we got to see was John Carney in the Close-Up Gallery.  He performed sleight of hand tricks which were really neat.  Tora arranged for our dinner reservations which was very good.  Kind of expensive though but the serving size was filing.  It felt so glamorous dining there because everyone is dressed up which was so refreshing.  By the way, they do have a dress code so read up before you go,As yelpers, we were dying a slow death though because you are not allowed to take any pictures.  That was hard!!  So many times I was dying to take a pic!!  We took pictures outside before being let in at 5 PM.Tora was really great at maneuvering us around in order to get us to the magic shows on time.  If you line up early for a show, obviously you get REALLY great seats plus having dinner reservations helps a whole lot!  In one of the shows, we were front and center so my brother got picked on by Lindsay Benner which was great!!  Her show is SO GOOD.  Definitely entertaining till the end.  Ms Benner, Gregory Wilson and Dan Sperry were in the Palace of Mystery theater which had the largest seating capacity.  ALL SHOWS WERE GREAT!  LOVED IT!!  Funny and mystifying.  The last show that I saw was Toto in the close-up gallery room which is an intimate venue where you see mind-boggling sleight of hand tricks.  Not only was he good, he was also kind of funny.  Unfortunately we were one of the lasts to enter the venue, so we had to stand against the wall.  They have a small gift shop.  I wanted to purchase a magnet, but they didn't have any I liked so I got a cute box of matches instead.TY again Tora for a wonderful evening!",5 star rating
83,3/6/2019,"This is honestly the coolest place I've been to in LA. It's so different and there is nothing like it anywhere. Get there early so you can go to the more private rooms and get an intimate show. I've been used in 2 smaller magic shows so I know they don't plant people in these rooms. I heard the food a long time ago wasn't great but the last 5-7 years I've been it was fine. Dare I say...delicious. I don't want to give away too much but you have to do this. Also, just know even with a guest pass the entry fee is $25-35 depending on the night and you have to book a reservation for dinner. You cannot get in at all without a dinner reservation people. Dress up! Suits and dresses.",5 star rating
84,3/8/2019,"Love magic? Know someone that loves magic? Then you gotta come to the Magic Castle!  But you need an invite first so ask around.  Luckily we knew someone, who knew someone, who knew someone that could get us in.  Even then, the reservations were pretty booked up for a month so plan in advance.  The dress code here is super strict so make sure you follow the code and dress to the nines!  Once you get the hookup, you make your dinner reservation and you can go in whenever the Castle opens to watch the mini shows and wander around.  Then, you have dinner and they give you your tickets for the main show.This place isn't cheap, so it'll cost you a pretty penny. It was $15 for parking, $35 for entry per person on the weekend, and then the mandatory dinner and optional drinks so expect to spend more than $100+/person.  They have a bar and also serve food at the bar if you get hungry before your dinner reservation.  The food at the Magic Castle is pricey, but it's surprisingly good for a dinner and a show type of place.  My favorite was the Sea Bass!  But you'll need an appetizer or dessert, or both, because while it sure was delicious, it wasn't very filling.  The beef Wellington isn't made by Gordon Ramsay, but it was still good.  I just wish the temperature of it was hotter.  The desserts were amazing and they even brought some extra ice creams out for our birthday boys.  I definitely recommend the banana cream pie!!! The chocolate cake was good too, but the banana cream pie was the clear winner.Our group has been here twice now and we discovered new places in the castle that we totally missed the first time.  One of the magicians did advise to wander around so we did and we randomly found rooms where magicians were performing to small audiences.The close up gallery shows were mostly card tricks, which aren't my favorite, but they kept me wondering HOWWW?? the whole time.  If you sit near the front, you'll have a chance to get picked to volunteer.There's always that jerk in the crowd that has to ruin everyone's fun (yeah I'm talking about you, Kevin from Orange County).  If you know how the trick is done, keep it to yourself or if you think there are cameras and that's how he knows what your card was, this isn't the place for you.  People sure do love to drink here, but please control yourself.  There was a drunk girl that tripped and fell on her way out during our main show and made a big distraction from the act.  As for the main show, the different acts were very entertaining and the time flew by before I knew it.",4 star rating

This was my first time coming to the Magic Castle and truth be told, it was on my bucket list when my parents got invited when I was a kid. My friend is a member which is awesome within itself and I am so grateful I got to experience such a historic shrine in LA. There are so many places to explore we barely cracked the surface. The acts were superb! The magicians are extremely talented and entertaining. They had such suave and comedy that felt like I was in a Vegas show. It's such an intimate place considering it is a castle. Such cool memorabilia and history in almost every room. I got called on stage for one of the shows which blew me away! I am so lucky to have gotten a first hand experience with a magician. There was fascinating art on the walls, fun games, little nooks and crannies to discover unusual oddities and so much more! We also ordered food and drinks which were pretty amazing! The drinks are very stiff which is nice and well worth the money.

You'll go through the effort of digging up an invite, and dressing up to their stuffy and rigid guidelines, and over-paying for their average food, over-paying for their unremarkable drinks, and sitting through a mixed bag of seen-it-a-hundred-times-before ""magic""-- and then they'll expect a thank you, as they've so graciously ""allowed"" you inside.

87,11/3/2019,"A friend hooked me up as he is a member, and wife mentioned she wanted to check it out.  Win WIn!  We used the trip for our wedding anniversary celebration and we looked forward to a rare night of dressing us, fine dining and entertainment.  The check-in process went without a hitch.  After saying the magic word, the real experience began.  Inside the club it seemed REALLY crowded.  Not the intimate experience we were hoping for.  We knew right then it would be more like a Disneyland-like experience rather than what we had hoped for.  In any case, we got a drink and kinda made way of the land to get the layout.  We walked around and were hoping to get in a couple shows before out 8pm dinner reservation.  We ended up standing in two lines that sold out and opted for a entertaining walk-up show at the library bar.  Top notch performance - we were about 10' away from the performer. Since we were between shows, we decided to try and get in dinner early.  We were able to get seated quickly and were treated by excellent food - Oyster's Rockefeller, Prime Rib, and a Tomahawk Rib-eye.  Excellent food, service and nice ambiance.After dinner we tried to get into another couple of shows only to be disappointed - again, you got to get in line early.  We did have two tickets to a long show and eventually went to that.  The Bad Boys of Magic were excellent and we were happy to finally see a more formal live show.  Despite there being more shows later in the night, we were tired from a long day and walked back to the room for our own magic! ;-)Overall, I like the place but was disappointed in how crowded it was.  Venue - 4 stars, Shows - 4 stars, Crowd - 2 stars, Food - 4 stars. Would have loved to give it a higher rating, but the lack of seeing more shows was a buzz kill.",3 star rating
88,9/23/2018,"My friends and I had a wonderful time at The Magic Castle last night. Here's what you need to know:PARKING:Valet is $15 and you pay that immediately with the entrants fee at the reception table upon arrivalStreet parking is available (scarce though) but you need to walk up the hill to get the the Magic CastleDRESS CODE:This clubhouse has a strict dress code. Men must come in a tie, collared shirt, structured jacket and dress shoes. Women can wear dresses, thigh-high tunics with pants, or a dress suit. No rompers, sandals, or excessively revealing clothing are allowed Please look at their website for additional information. The lady in front of me wore a romper and she needed to be brought aside so they could put a loaner skirt on her.FOOD:The food is all right. I mean... for the price... the food isn't spectacular. This is where they get a point off. I don't usually send food back. Even if it isn't to my liking, I will usually try to finish my food and not make a fuss about it, partly due to my culture. My friend had a steak that was extremely dry. I had a bite of it and there was no juice at all from the steak. It was rubbery and very very tasteless. It was so bad, I actually spit out the steak. Our server was kind enough to remove it off of our bill. We didn't want them to remake another steak either because our steak came out really late. It took an hour for us to get our food upon seating. We were so hungry. We almost missed the main show because our dinner arrived so late. Food options ranges from steak and shellfish to soups, pasta, and salad. The prices for the entree ranges from $30-$100+BAR:The clubhouse has 5 bars. The bar upstairs, across from the dining area is the busiest as the bartender makes the drinks for all of the guests at the bar and the dining guests as well. I would suggest visiting another bar. Also when you are viewing a magic show, there will generally be someone walking around taking drink orders for you so you don't have to wait at the bar. Drinks average out to about $12-$14 a cocktail and $17+ an average whiskey. They have a full bar and you can take your drinks everywhere you go.MAGIC:Magic is everywhere at the castle. Take a look at the program that is given to you and note the time slots for all of the shows. Get in line at least 15-20 minutes early to ensure entry to a show. If there's a big gap between one show and the next and you have down time, you can visit the basement to view shows that don't require a maximum occupant. It can get crowded down there so be advised that you might be standing. They have rotating mini acts. After your dinner, you will be given tickets to the main show that guarantee seating for you and your guests. Irma, the piano-playing ghost is also on the first floor behind the bar. Give her a song request and watch her play your song. The clubhouse is small on the inside but has several rooms you can visit.DECOR/VIBE: The decor inside The Magic Castle is pretty decadent. The building is quite old and it was originally home to a family before it got turned into a clubhouse for magicians. There's definitely a romantic feeling about the place that brings forth excitement and wonder. This is great for a date or even a night out. MISC:Upon arriving to the castle, you can say ""open sesame"" and a bookcase will slide right, revealing the entrance to the clubhouse. The clubhouse is open or brunch on the weekends. That is the only time that children are allowed. Otherwise, the clubhouse is strictly only for guests 21 and over with valid ID. There is absolutely no photography beyond the lobby. They tell you multiple times when you are in the clubhouse. The reason why it might be difficult for you to get an invite is because the way you act or behave at the castle affects the person that invites you. If you truly want to get in, try asking your network of friends. Someone might know someone who knows someone that could perhaps grant you an invite. You could always kindly ask a magician to email you an invite but a lot of the time, they are hesitant to give out passes because they don't know your character. One last way that I know might get you a pass is if you head on over to a magic shop. In most cases, the owner will have a membership or have some sort of way to help you. All in all, the experience is great and you have to go, at least once. Be prepared to break your wallet on your visit. Drinks, food, and fees aren't cheap.",4 star rating
89,12/6/2019,"Second time here and still amazes me! Tips: - If you're trying to make the first show, stand in line at least 40 min prior. We were still at the bar and went 30 mins prior to showtime and it was already filled.- Go on weekends, more magicians are roaming around and the downstairs room is open. During the week they have class and is closed off.- If you're vegetarian you can ask for appetizers instead of their one option vegetarian dinner as long as it adds up to more than $38- Dress code enforced. I brought a jacket with my smquestionable dress and was ok but the girl behind us got turned away!

91,1/9/2019,"This was literally a magical experience!!!! It's always been a dream to do a meet and greet with the post graduates of Ilvermorny, school of witchcraft and wizardry. Each and every magician were all masters of their own craft and had such a way to captivate their audience. Most nights typically require their guests to be 21 or older. You're expected to dress up and they do not allow any photos past a certain point. I really appreciated this because it really added to their mystery, excitement, and exclusivity factor. They offer a pamphlet upon entry which will provide you with a list of magicians that will be performing along with their times and locations.  I wasn't able to get a signature of all the magicians I've encountered but I managed to get the autographs of the magicians that were able. Things can get pretty pricy as valet alone can cost you up to $15. Despite the costs, there's nothing like watching magic up front. I would personally recommend grabbing a seat at the front as they tend to be much more interactive!",5 star rating

93,3/2/2018,"When I was 8, my mom hired a magician to perform at my birthday party. I was in awe and have been a magic enthusiast since that day. I began reading, learning, and watching everything about magic that I could find and that's when I heard about this special place. I have wanted to visit The Magic Castle for nearly 25 years. It became a ""bucket list"" thing for me to do and I finally had the opportunity to cross it off my list. I live on the East Coast and the timing was finally right for me to head out to LA for a few days, with visiting the Magic Castle the top priority. A group of adventurous friends joined me for this trip and we had an amazing time exploring and absorbing all the secrets and stories kept inside this hallowed space. I was lucky enough to see a show in each of the performing spaces, enjoy some of the delicious food (I would recommend the beef satay skewers and the Cobb salad - so yummy!) plus we enjoyed (a few of) their signature drink the ""Magical Moment"". Later that evening, we sat next to and were entertained by Irma and her dazzling piano while we enjoyed the banana cream pie (which had a nutter butter cookie crust) it was absolutely delicious! We had the good fortune of meeting Milt Larsen the night we were there, he was sitting at the end of the Owl Bar, under an oil painting of himself. It was a surreal moment for me and I hesitated approaching him as I didn't want to interrupt his conversation.  As luck would have it, he recognized the member we were there with and I got my chance to shake his hand and thank him for creating this wonderful space that a lover and magic enthusiast like me could enjoy. We had the best time here and I hope I have the opportunity to return one day.",5 star rating
94,11/21/2017,"Had an opportunity to come here for a friend's birthday as he knew someone who is a member here. My friend had reservations for 13, but unfortunately, two dropped out and if you don't cancel ahead of time, you have to pay a $50 fee for each person that doesn't show up. Once we arrived, the bouncer in the front checked IDs and paid extra attention to the guys to see if they all had ties and slacks on. One of the guys had colored jeans on and you really could not tell, but the bouncer made a comment about it and told him he would make an exception just this once. Once we got in, everyone had to pay a $30 entrance fee and they stated no pictures whatsoever after the lobby. Once you get in, there is a bar and upstairs, is the dining area and the rest of the magic show rooms. Dinner: Once we were seated, our waitress introduced herself and shared what was the specials for the night. I ended up ordering the rack of lamb and the Thai curry bisque. Both were delicious! Lamb was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and I was so full I dreaded ordering it due to the tight dress I was wearing (ha-ha). Once we were ready to pay, they only accepted the use of 4 credit cards, so I recommend brining cash for a big party like we had so you don't have to worry about calculating how much each person owes, etc.Magic Shows: The magic shows were fun! YouGo into each magic show room (about 4-5?) and watch shows that are 15-30 minutes each. There are bars everywhere, so ordering drinks was very easy to do throughout the night. Important: they are very strict with taking photos, so if you take even just a selfie, remember, there are cameras and they will hunt you down! They will even make you delete photos from your ""deleted photos"" folder on your phone lolOverall, the experience here was fun! But for me, it's one of those things that you try once and your good after that.",4 star rating
95,10/25/2019,"I'm the kind of guy who doesn't care for spooky mazes or sweaty concerts. You couldn't get me to cheer or join a wave at a sports event, or even go for that matter.I didn't think I'd be impressed to be honest. I just figured the exclusiveness was a reason to go.Valet $14 i think? It's LA. Go figure.Entry fee $35. Cheese and rice iono if this'll be worth it.Dinner $70ish after taxtip. 10oz prime rib was quite soft and delicious. Au jus was a great complement. Loved the mash potatoes and broccolini? There's no complimentary bread or anything here tho. Someone at the table ordered some $15 basket breadsticks (5 pieces, man the look on his face, and when he asked if it was like refillable and he got shut down I don't think he's ever eaten at ""fine"" dining places). Now I gauge the dinner experience not by the big ticket item, but by the little things, these things get missed a lot because they aren't really worth anything, it's not like another $15 glass of wine which contributes to your 20% tip padding. I ask for some lemons on the side when I get my water (and don't snub your nose at me, water is actually very important to your health, many people go straight for alcohol like it's the last barrel on earth and most people don't drink enough water a day, it's 64oz minimum a day btw). So the lemons took four polite inquiries/reminders before they showed, I didn't time it but let's say half an hour? Oh! And when you're at a legit upscale dining establishment, your water should never be empty. Our glasses were empty at least 3 times and only refilled on request. The little things.oH AND we were supposed to get tickets for the show with our meal....which we didn't know till after we paid and started roaming for side shows till the big one. Someone told someone then went back upstairs to the dining floor and phew got all 6 tickets.Now the show. Was FREAKING awesome. Good jokes, fun times, totally mind invigorating to see the ""magic"" tricks. Totally entertained. I was really expecting hidden doors tho.  Men's bathroom is so small it's like a corner, basically you can shake each other's cucumbers when you squeeze around them.  The crowds made it hard to get in for the small room shows.The lack of air/AC and overcrowding tho was really a major experience subtractor. Esp since guys really only get one clothing option. Dress pants jacket and tie, which the jacket must stay on if ur walking anywhere. Women are lucky they get to wear any kind of dress with plenty of openings for airflow. My balls were sweating Niagara Falls with 0 airflow.One of the hosts squeezed our party of 10 into a last show at the end tho, appreciate the effort to accommodate. Was it an Italian magician? I couldn't catch the names but SUPER loved his chat, hugely hugely entertained and amazed.The no pictures rule is understandable, tho comon what about the food? It's food, there's no magic with the food.",4 star rating
96,9/2/2017,"I've heard about the Magic Castle for a while now and was able to attend during the weekday.  I would describe this place as a cross between the aesthetics of the Old Spaghetti Factory meets a magicians museum and the LA escape room.First off, this place is not cheap by any means. With parking, entrance fee, meal and drinks, you are likely to spend $100+ per person.The dress code is strict. An employee will check your attire in front and ask you to check in any coats/jacket that do not meet the requirements. Once you pay your entrance fee, you are not allowed to take any photos inside.They have a brochure that have magic show times.  Our rookie mistake is that we thought lining up 20 minutes early would be enough time, but the show was booked by the time we lined up. So get in line early!One cool thing to check out when you enter the first floor is the back piano room. There are a few seats there and ""erma,"" an invisible piano player with their invisible bird. Erma takes music requests which is super entertaining. She played everything from KC and JoJo, Scrubs, Journey, Dolly Parton and more.  This was actually one of my favorite things about this place.The food was just okay for me.  I had truffle fries, a crab bisque, and the sea bass.  I would order the truffle fries and bisque again, but not the fish. Pros:-lots of floors and rooms to explore-great ambiance -you'll likely see celebrities here-they have a small gift shop up frontCons:- The A/C seemed to be broken when we were there so the heat was pretty miserable.  - Some of their employees used sexist language like ""sweetie"".  One of the magicians made a cringe worthy comment of buying a woman with dollar bills, while others made comments like gentlemen could take off their coats in certain rooms (not very inclusive/progressive when it comes to dress code). - some of the magic acts we saw were a bit cheesy - our waiter was pretty obnoxious.  He kept trying to make us order more so he could get a larger tip.Overall, I'm glad to have had the opportunity to have this experience.  I would recommend anyone to try it at least once.",3 star rating
97,11/29/2017,"I love going here!  It is difficult to get in as you must know a member or get an invite, but it is always worth it.  As one of the exclusive clubs in L.A., you get an evening filled with magic shows in various size rooms, some close up and some on stage.  The whole facility, even when not in a show is unique and entertaining.  There will not be any downtime, other than a short line to get in a show room.The caliber of Magicians is top notch.  They have the best of the best as well as unique and creative ones.  It also attracts Magicians from around the world.  The diversity between acts really opens your mind to the world of magic.  I always have those jaw-dropping moments of ""how'd they do that?""  I don't really want to know, but that is what you go for.  This place is very upscale.  Women need to be in dresses and men in full suit and tie.  They are very strict, but hey it's not a cheap evening, so dress the part.This was my 4th visit here, but it was the first time we took a tour of the Castle.  It was very informative and I am glad the Magician who was volunteering that night offered it to us.  If you ever wonder about all the art work you see in the halls, pictures on the walls, history of the Owl Bar, and so much more, I highly recommend doing this.  Our group got there shortly after they opened, grabbed drinks and did the tour right away before the shows started.  The only reason I can't give the Castle 5 stars is because the food wasn't quite to par for the prices.  I know you don't come here for the food, but it is required to eat at the restaurant if you are a guest, so it deserves mentioning.  I will say, the Ahi Tuna appetizer is amazing!!!  The rolls came out late and were cold and dry.  I ordered the Lamb well done, but it was still very bloody.  It was also on the colder side.  My friends all had similar meal experiences with Salmon served cold, soup very salty, or meat over cooked.  Maybe it wasn't the chefs night, who knows.  We were pleased with our waiter.  He was friendly and accommodating to our requests.I can't wait to go back as I can always count on a good time!",4 star rating
98,8/23/2018,"The Magic Castle is, quite essentially, one of the top exclusive venues in the Los Angeles scene. ""How do I go?!"" you ask? Simple my child - and here are a few methods:1) Be (or know) a magician2) Request (or beg) for an invitation to 'THE Magic Castle'3) Dish out the green in your wallet for the (mandatory purchase) pricey dinner4) Keep buying drinks and walking throughout the Castle to view eye-popping close-up magic tricksOR1) Shell out an obscene amount of money for The Magic Castle membership ($10,000-ish starting)2) Go in anytime (without magician sponsorship or the mandatory dinner) and watch the magic (pun intended)Remember, there is absolutely NO photography! If you do, you'll be like that fool who heard the rules at the entrance but still decided to (more than once) take photos and subsequently get kicked out.100% recommend you, yes you eager Yelper who is still reading this post (thanks by the way), to definitely get yourself in to watch the magic!",4 star rating
99,1/7/2020,"My time spent here was far from the magical experience you'd expect to be given. Every person, from the doorman to the manager follows a set of rules to judge you based on your appearance if you look good enough to come inside and walk around.  As an invite only place, you'd assume this place thrives on treating it's guests with the utmost joy, honor, and respect. Instead our very first experience had us waiting at the door and feeling uninvited. My friends and I came to celebrate a birthday. We came in dressed with our nicest and some more expensive gear, from outer wear to shoes. From the beginning we got stopped by the door, and instead of feeling welcomed, the birthday girl was told her shoe wasn't good enough to come in. After what felt like the longest most embarrassing conversation with the staff & manager, informing them that her medical condition only allows her to wear the shoes she had on, the manager finally ""let us"" go inside. Might I remind you that we are the invited guests that should expect to be made feel special but instead started the night with judgement and humiliation. Then comes the hosts who are given a set of rules to follow... to judge your guests. Again the birthday girl was asked to take off her really nice outer wear only to be given a black penguin like suit that was completely ripped on the inside. Again humiliated and judged she was told it was more appropriate to wear the shredded penguin suit than her nice otter wear.  As we walk around for only a minute, the staff continue to tell the Birthday girl that she has to keep the black penguin suit with the plentiful holes on at all times. When we spoke to the same manager about the humiliation, he decided it was better on his part to justify his staff instead of apologizing and treating us like the honored guests should feel. The manager again kept her in what felt like another 20 minute humiliating conversation now about her outer wear, which took him that long to realize he was wrong. Only after the two humiliating conversations did he go get the Birthday girl's coat and offered to get her a drink...but the Birthday girl doesn't drink alcohol and numbing her with alcohol will still not be enough to forget the worst night we have ever had. Feeling unwelcomed and completely humiliated the Birthday girl was shaken with tears. What a way to welcome your guests to your magical castle. We left soon after and was offered a full refund, only to be charged $90 on our card, which is only supposed to happen if you don't show up. We showed up, was judged from the get-go, the Birthday girl who is a lesbian felt completely discriminated by her attire and appearance, and the head manager in charge had nothing better to say but to justify himself and his staff for the pure judgement placed on one person. When you start the entire night like that, it doesn't make anyone want to come back to feel what we felt. LGBTQ community... beware! You might not make it out your car door before the judgement and unwelcoming humiliation starts from the staff who work here, because it's literally their job to do so.",1 star rating
100,7/16/2017,"Oh yea, we feeling expensive, classy and formal tonight! Getting all dolled up for a magical night at Magic Castle, woohoo!!! :)My awesome group of six (Myself, Isobel L., Joyce G., and Karen (Tora's M.'s buddy) were first time virgins, while Jeff B., and Tora herself were veterans) got to enjoy a magical night filled with various wondrous, magical parlor tricks that delighted and brought back out the kid in all of us - excitement, suspense, giggles, and overall, good times!!! :)Photography Rules: You are only allowed pics outside of Magic Castle. Once inside, you cannot take any pics. They will even remind you again at each show you attend. If the employees catch you taking pics, you'll either be told to quickly to put it away, or they might ask you to leave.Admission: $30 + Valet Fee: $13 = $43Once you pay, there's an owl statue that you'll say ""Open Sesame!"" It'll reveal an open bookcase secret passage that'll take you to the magicians' parlor - filled with old school magician posters, magician portraits and character sketches.While waiting for various shows, there's various bar areas as well as cocktail waitresses walking around taking your drink orders too. Tip: Water Bottles costs $4, and so buy a Shirley Temple or Soda instead - it's $3, and worth more bang for your buck!Should you take in a dinner (not required, but I definitely recommend it) - you must purchase an actual entree. You cannot just buy sides or appetizers alone, darn!We started off with Cheesy Garlic Bread, yum! Afterwards, I got the $41 Beef Wellington, served with whipped mashed potatoes and crispy/crunchy skinny asparagus and carrots. Served along with my $3 Shirley Temple drink and iced water continuously refilled throughout. I also got a Banana Creme slice - so good!!!! Huge pie slice (think of two pie slices on top of each other!). Honestly, I liked the $11 Banana Cream pie more than the Beef Wellington. It was good, but I was still hungry, and so thus dessert sealed the final deal, lol!Also, since it was Isobel's Birthday Month (Happy Birthday, Isobel!!!) - she got a complimentary Champagne and Dessert (Vanilla Bean Ice cream inside a chocolate hat), that she shared graciously with all of us :)With dinner, the automatic 8pm in the Palace of Mystery is also include. This show also happens to be the longest running one - 45mins, but it goes by fast though! Time flies when you're having fun *sighs* Plus, that show happens to be my favorite one, hehe!The 8pm Show at Palace of Mystery - my favorite Magician was Lindsay Benner - she performed a funny, comical ""Crazy in Love"" show, and since we were sitting in front, she picked on Jeff B., and made him blush onstage! She had this one act where she had this bell-hip type of bra, and they played muscial-bell-hop-boobies act. This would've been the one time I wished we could've taken pics or videos. Pretty much, she was the female version of Willy Wonka from Beetle House LA - another nipple love scene with Jeff B., lol!!Since we were there on a Saturday night, Magic Castle was opened until 2am for various magic acts on schedule that night. I stayed until 11pm, and then bowed out. The last act I saw was Magician Toto (Japanese Magician) - in the Close Up Gallery Room, he was hysterical and magicial! Sweet as pie, and a great act to end out the magical night :)One Star Off: The AC system in small parlor rooms doesn't ventilate very well. Do prepare to experience some stuffiness.Overall, I had a fun time! Many thanks to Tora M., for getting us the tickets, and popping some first timers' cherries, lol! Definitely a must place to check out in LA, if you get the chance.Three ways of getting in here: 1. You must be a member. 2. Know someone who has Magic Castle access or 3. Pasadena City College and Glendale City College offers trips here (but you must check their website for the Extended Adult Learning Day Trip Courses for times and availability).",4 star rating
101,8/10/2018,"So much history and nostalgia that you must visit multiple times to appreciate the ornate details, wicked talent and enchanting ambiance the Magic Castle offers. This members only club is like no other. Each room in the castle has either a bar or a magician and some rooms have both. If done right you could see up to 4-5 magic shows and still enjoy some casual menu food items served at the center/main bar. If you choose to opt for the main dining room ( which is fabulous) you won't be able to see as many shows, so this time we hit as many as we could and we were  fine with the bar food menu and drinks. The Owl burger is delicious as is the French dip; Cobb salad and garlic cheese bread also yum but I would pass on the street style tacos. To keep the integrity of the club pictures are strictly prohibited within the Castle. There are a few photo opportunities outside and in the main entrance but other than that snapping pics is really frowned upon. We were a group of eight and we got into every show that we wanted to see. The close up gallery is mind blowing and the Palace of Mystery was so entertaining! It's all a who's who and if you can get an invitation to visit I highly recommend you accept.  A five star "" Magical evening"" at The Magic Castle.",5 star rating
102,7/16/2017,"In an age in which entertainment seems to be synonymous with technology, how refreshing it is to go back to the basics of wonder and amazement and laughter at the Magic Castle in Hollywood, a club devoted to the art of real magic and live entertainment. It's a maze of showrooms and bars and mysterious nooks and crannies with a magician around every corner, ready and willing to share their craft, make you laugh, stare in awe and say......""AMAZING!!!"". A group of us attended on a Saturday night ($30 entry and $13 valet); it was my very first time but luckily we had fabulous Tora M. to show us the ropes. We opted to dine at the Magic Castle restaurant in order to get guaranteed admission to the main show in the Palace of Mystery; you must order an entree for dinner btw. May I recommend the Cobb Salad as entree? It's gigantic, healthy and delicous and the most reasonable of the entrees. If you are celebrating a birthday anytime soon, the Magic Castle staff will give you a Birthday Button and you'll receive a complimentary glass of champagne and dessert with dinner. So wonderful! The Magic Castle itself reminded me of the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, complete with portraits with moving eyes and supposed ghosts and mysterious skeletons appearing in phone booths. It's a bit of a maze and I'm so glad we had experienced folks to guide us. A HUGE shout out to Tora M. for not only arranging our visit but making sure that we had front row seats for a lot of the shows!!! Woo-hoo! The entertainment itself blew me away. Sleight of hand is no easy task and world class masters come to the Magic Castle to share their acts. Vaudeville has its place here too: my favorite act was Lindsay Benner's ""Book of Love""......wow! I won't give away the plot but let's just say she gives Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction"" a run for her money for the title of Craziest Girlfriend Ever. And huge props to our group member Yelper Jeff B who now has his own fan base.....that's right, after he volunteered to be part of her act, people were asking us afterwards if he was a ""plant"" because he was so good! All of the acts were AMAZING! Some tips: don't forget to dress up. Dress code is very strict and honestly it was kind of shocking and funny in a good way to see so many manbuns and hipster beards above a coat and tie. Most of the shows have cocktails servers eager to bring you a drink before the show. As I learned from Yelper Kim T., if you're thirsty, order a Shirley Temple ($3), best deal there by far. There is a gift shop; I'd go for the match books ($1) as the perfect souvenir. No phones or cameras....you may go through withdrawals but it's worth it. Yes, it is a private club and it helps to know a member but there are other ways in if you look here: latimes.com/travel/la-tr…",5 star rating
103,10/29/2019,"Very thankful to be able to experience the The Magic Castle. I read a lot of the reviews regarding the food and here's what I would say, ""Try it for yourself and form your own opinions!"" Here's mine. Ordered the Beef Wellington. Why? It's a super old fashioned thing to eat but this was my ""When in Rome"" moment. It was so good! Meat tender. Pastry fluffy. Minced mushroom and liver seasoned perfectly. I very much enjoyed this dish. I was hesitant because of the liver but trust me, it's very good and I simply enjoyed my meal. Dessert! Pistachio creme brûlée! Very good with a lot of flavor and the portion was very generous. We also ordered the gluten free chocolate cake. I don't care about the no gluten but it was a special, so we wanted to try it. No complaints! Moist and a decadent chocolate. As much as I enjoyed my dining experience, I still gave the place only 4 stars. We went during the Halloween celebration and there was so many decorations throughout the castle, I felt like some of the charm was taken away. Parking is atrocious. We waited in a long line to get in and a long line to get out. I didn't like how much of a deal was made about dress code to show up and find people in horrible costumes, flip flops and way too much ass hanging out. That was just weird. I felt like many people there were going to a frat party. Not the atmosphere I wanted on a $400 night. Final concern is the old fashion. It's not an old fashion, it's their pre-made version and I get that but STOP. The old fashion is a special drink that should not be tweaked or served out of a barrel. Final thoughts, The SHOWS!! I enjoyed the close up magic a lot more but the main show was hilarious. Go with the intention of having fun, join in and just be cool. Don't be one of those who think you know the tricks or can figure them out. It's funny!!! You're there to have fun! Enjoy and participate with the performers. The more the crowd got into the show and cheered, the better they performed! If I ever go back, hopefully I can go when it's not Halloween and see the real look of the castle!",4 star rating

108,5/28/2018,"The magic castle is a fun place for a date or group of friends, but in order to get into this exclusive castle you have to be a member or guest of a member. The downside of being a guest  is that you have to pay a $30 entrance fee and a meal with entree ranging from $40 to $80 for American fare. Reservations are required and quickly fill up months in advance during the weekend evenings, so plan ahead especially if you have a large group. There is a strict dress code, and you will see men and women dress to impress. See their dress code policy on the website as brunch, lunch, and dinner may vary. Once you enter the castle, there is a no picture or video policy, including the food. I assume this is in place to protect the secrecy of the magic tricks and create a mystic about the castle. The less people can see, the more curios they become. However, there is a photo backdrop banner of the magic castle right before you enter where you can take as many pictures as your heart desires.Inside the castle the lighting is very dimmed and no natural light coming through as all the windows are blacked out. There are two levels with the dining area being on the upper level and a few bars scattered throughout the interior. There are magic shows exhibited throughout the castle from small to large rooms. You can grab a brochure right when you enter for the show times. Except for the main magic show that is included with your meal, all other shows are first come first serve basis, and there is a no saving spot policy.There is a variety of magic tricks from pulling doves and even a cat from out of know where to revealing audiences personal information such as credit card information or driver licenses while the magician is blind folded, but most of the magic tricks that we saw were card tricks. The quality and entertainment aspect of the magic will just depend on the magician. Some are funny and entertaining, while others try a bit too hard to be funny. There are seats, but standing is an option for most of the rooms. The rooms are dated and some of them need renovating as you can see the exposed a/c ducks and covering of wiring with plastic. Set aside 2-3 hours before or after your dinner/lunch reservation to check out the magic shows. The food is that of American fare, steak, seafood, etc. My girlfriend and I ordered the filet mignon. Mine was cooked perfectly, and with the sauce and vegetables that include potatoes and vegetables, there was no need for ordering a side dish. However, we did order the calamari as our starter. It was good, better than expected as the calamari was cooked perfectly with a lite batter. The pretzel bread although warm, was a bite dense. The dining table is small in order to fit as many patrons as possible, so eating space can be an issue especially if you order sides and wine. Overall, the meal was good. If you're lucky enough to visit the Magic Castle, I would definitely recommend if It's your first time. Whether or not you plan to visit after that will be entirely up to the experience.",3 star rating
109,3/1/2020,"The shows and magic are great here, but the food is seriously lacking. We ordered a $50 swordfish entree and $42 salmon entree. Both were nearly inedible.

If we do visit again, we'd definitely avoid dining and just stick to the magic.",2 star rating
110,10/8/2017,"I love coming to the magic castle. This is invite only... luckily got a pass through a member or you can try emailing magicians. I've gone here 3 times for dinner all great experiences. If you take a photo they give you another pass to go again. Today I had gone to brunch for the first time. It was buffet style prime rib, crab legs, potatoes & etc. Loved the homemade ice cream! Celebrated my brothers birthday they brought out a small dessert with a candle. Take advantage of the unlimited mimosas, our waiter made it worth it! I suggest doing the early dinner or early brunch so you're able to catch all the shows. It can be a bit confusing where to go so just ask all the employees they're all nice. Entrance fee is $20 for brunch & $30 for dinner. We were a party of 10 so gratuity was included. Brunch was $60 each. Dinner ranges $40-60 depending on what you order. Weekend brunch is all ages & more lenient with attire. Dinner is 21+ only... girls have to wear a formal dress & guys have to wear a suit & tie. Valet is $13. Unfortunately, no photos inside the castle!

112,6/9/2019,"For all the air of exclusivity and $$$ that we paid, I wish I had been more impressed with the evening. You dress up but can't take photos inside; okay, fine. That just means every time you go in the (small) women's restrooms, groups of girls are doing mini photo shoots. Drinks and cocktails are good and will run about $14 (and they're small). There generally seems to be limited seating everywhere so be prepared to stand. They do require each guest to purchase an entree ($50+) during dinner from their fairly small entree menu (that only contains one vegetarian dish), and they won't allow you to order a combo of appetizers, sides, and salads instead even if you're spending $$$.  What they really need to do is set a food and beverage minimum per guest to give people more flexibility. ALSO -- if you have dietary restrictions (i.e., lactose intolerance) make sure you double check your food. We had two incidents at our table where we had to send back dishes right away because we knew something was off. Kind of annoying for such a high end place.Our beverages were refilled and plates whisked away quickly but the food took forever to come out (an hour and 40 minutes from the time we were seated) and we almost missed the 8pm main show because of it. They did delay the show a few minutes but we had to leave our credit cards and come back after to finish paying for dinner. Because of this, all the 9:15 shows were completely full and we had to wait for a 10pm show, so basically a lot of the night was spent waiting and we only made it to two shows. To summarize:- The magic shows are really fun and certainly impressive but they definitely overbook the place. There's people everywhere and you need to show up early to all the shows to get in / even if you get in you may need to stand.- Food is good but wish they catered to more diverse types of diners. Not everyone wants a heavy meal of steak or lamb. And they need to pay more attention to food restriction requests.",3 star rating

114,7/1/2017,"I love this place! I know someone who is a member of the club so that's how I got in. You need to know a member to get in but I'm sure you can link up with someone online, they can get you guest passes or you can go with them if they like you enough. A cover charge is required to get in with your pass and a dinner reservation is as well required if you go with a guest pass for the night. Anyways, the dinner isn't bad, for the high price it could be better. I got lobster bisque and filet steak. On weekends you get the brunch buffet for a morning trip, it's breakfast, it's hard to mess up breakfast hahah. Of course I talked about the food first lol.The shows are amazing. This place showcases some of the best magicians in the world. Noooo Criss Angel doesn't perform here, I can picture you all groaning right now.. They have multiple rooms of magic, a few small and intimate rooms to see some close up stuff and a large room for stage magic. And my personal favorite, they have 5 bars! Always open at night and a few of the bars have magic happening at them. I did see a guy try to perform hypnosis on females at the bar once which was a bit creepy but ti's MAGIC!The vibe of this place is very cool and mysterious obviously, it's a magic castle. My favorite part is the ghost piano that plays any song you ask it to play. Except it didn't know how to play the song Bad and Boujee by Migos so it isn't so magical after all I guess. There are no photos allowed in the castle so when I saw Neil Patrick Harris it didn't actually happen because I don't have pics to prove it lol.. but I love the exclusivity of this place. It adds to its luster.So... go here if you get the chance! Definitely something you should experience once in your lifetime.",4 star rating
115,1/24/2019,"The food was better than the show.THE AMBIANCE:We were lucky to meet a member of The Magic Castle (""The MC"") on our plane ride (super random) and he offered to mail us passes. Super sweet. Well, the passes arrived and we just experienced The MC yesterday evening. We were a party of six (6) and even though we did not arrive at the same time, we were allowed inside.The lobby is small and reminds me of Harry Potter. We paid an admission fee of $25 each person and a fee of $15 for valet. We said the magic word and were allowed inside the venue. You are only permitted to take photographs outside The MC and inside the lobby.After passing the bookshelf and walking in, you reach the bar area. The whole place looks old school. I loved the decor. You walk upstairs and there is a small tavern on the right, which probably seats around at most 10 people? I just caught a glimpse. You keep walking up the stairs and when you reach the top, make a left to the hostess stand for dinner reservations. There are a couple of rooms for dining. There are ols. small photographs that line some of the walls and old landscape pictures.THE FOOD:I had always wanted to try a Beef Wellington like the ones I would see on Master Chef, etc. I ordered their ""Academy Beef Wellington"" (beef tenderloin, truffle liver pate, wild mushroom and truffle duxelles, puff pastry, roasted garlic-whipped potatoes, seasonal vegetables, $48) as my entree and it did NOT disappoint. SO GOOD. The beef was super tender, medium rare, just how I like it. The pastry around the beef with the truffle liver pate was so delicious. I am also a fan of mashed potatoes and they were good. As I was eating my entree, I said, ""I actually like this way better than the steak I have had at Ruth's Chris."" The beef was THAT tender and delicious. I loved it. I also had the Banana Cream Pie and wow. It was super good. I have to say I was really impressed with the food.THE SHOW:It ran about an hour. The host was fun. The first act was great. A magician from Las Vegas, NV, I forgot his name. The second act was not so great. At the end of the show we were kind of left saying, that's it?THE TIPS:Our server, James, told us that only magicians can be Members of The MC. I replied that I read on the website that you can be a member even if you're not a magician, and he told me, ""no"" that only magicians could be members. Can someone explain to me the ""Associate"" member description on the website then? It reads the following:""Associate: People who love the art of magic and our Club.

It's such a great place to get to know new people and just enjoy being in such a special piece of old Hollywood.",5 star rating
117,6/28/2017,"Magic!!! One of LA's most illusive invite only places! If you do some googling, you can easily find a member to get some guest passes. Located on the same hill that Yamashiro is. Valet parking.There is a entry fee to get inside with your guest pass.Dinner reservation with a guest pass is required. You have to book weeks in advance. You also have to spent a certain amount per person, so no splitting dishes. They usually have 3 dinner times to pick from. I had the prime rib ($40) twice here and it was not bad. The bar is pricey, predrink if you want a buzz for the magic shows.Dress code is super strict. Suit and tie for men and dress for women. Do not try to be a rebel because they will deny you entry. I won't give details about the place, since it is most peoples first time and I don't want to spoil anyone's experience. The magic piano is awesome! I recommend you go when they open at 5, if you want to see the most shows possible. There is also a smaller crowd the earlier you go. The smaller shows have less people watching so you can get called up to help (my wife went up for two shows). There is usually a line to get into shows so plan out your time based on the schedule. With dinner you get a ticket to the main show. There are also a lot of individuals that do up close magic all over the venue.Great times. I cannot wait to go again!",5 star rating
118,9/9/2019,"If you can find your way into this place as it is a members only or by invitation, you will not be disappointed!  Notes to remember: wear your best gala attire, no pictures allowed at all inside (including selfies), and enjoy yourself! There is magic around every corner! The drinks were delicious! We did not partake in the food, but if invited again, I think we will.  It smelled great in the dining area.  There is valet for parking.  There's not much street parking to think of around the area, and if you find it, you would have to walk a decent amount in your beautiful clothes....just valet, it's worth it.  If not, take an Uber. ^_^",5 star rating

Ambience: Think of A magical palace done up by Disney.Price: steep but well worth itDress: dress code is tie and jacket for males and cocktail attire for femalesFood: amazing food, the waiter really knew his stuffBar: once you get past the magic owl and you walk down the hallway you will see the Bar infront if you. There is actually a quaint seating area if you go to your left which will take you to the backside of the barPiano: the backside of the bar will put you in the paino room.

120,11/28/2018,"This had to be one of the most anticipated nights of the LA trip at one of the oldest magicians clubs probably in the world. Strictly members club so the only way in is through invitation or perhaps a secret handshake  Warning : lots of cash on the hip required to fully enjoy the place from the cover charges, booze, overloaded menu prices and so on. Having said that the place itself is magnificently laid out and probably hasn't changed much since they opened their doors in Jan 1963. From the piano, skeletons, hidden rooms and of course the finely dressed guests. I'd read the food was overpriced and average so I can agree to the first point but I have to say the quality was great. Out group of 5 had the Beef Wellington, Salmon, Pasta, Chicken and Rib Eye and no one complained at all. The winner though had to be the Four Cheese Garlic Bread again overpriced but super delicious  Quick tips: for the 8pm dinner you'll receive tickets to the 10pm main show so advise you rush dinner (takes 30-45 mins to arrive) and get to the room upstairs at the back by 930-945pm for a decent seat otherwise you'll be at the back like us. Oh and no photos or phones on while inside which I understand but still a real shame. Also make sure you have your invite printed and on your phone with the code as the doormen are quite fussy. The cocktails are lush particularly the 'Smoke n Mirrors' Overall a cracking night and I'd love to go back one day /:",4 star rating

123,10/29/2018,"My husband and I had been dying to go to the Magic Castle for forever and finally got the chance to go. It did not disappoint. We went for a Saturday Brunch. It's worth knowing that for the weekend brunches they showcase some of their junior magicians and a number of the shows are geared toward younger kids. That does not, however, stop it from being extremely entertaining for all ages (kids or no kids). The junior magicians are talented and it is cool to see how the Castle invests in next generations. The food is a little expensive for the quality but it is still good! I can never be that disappointed in a buffet. I mean, who doesn't like an endless supply of food? I was surprised at how funny, talented and professional all the magicians were. The entire experience was one for the books and is definitely one I would recommend to others.",4 star rating
124,3/25/2018,"Disneyland is the most magical place in Orange County, but the real magic is located in Hollywood at the Magic Castle.Welcome to the Magic Castle! A castle with no princes and princesses, Magic Castle is the home of talented magicians and an entertainment center for magic enthusiasts. I was lucky enough to be taken there months ago. Rules of the Magic Castle:-You must be a member or have a guest card from a member to gain admittance.-Valid photo ID required.-You have to follow its dress code. -Guests are required to dine in.

Do not take pictures inside the Magic Castle or you'll get kicked out. You can check out the smaller performances before and after the main show. Ed Alonzo performed @ the main show when and he picked me to help with one of his tricks. I couldn't see the audience at all when I was on stage, but it's so much fun learning the tricks behind the scene. Thank you for a magical night!",4 star rating
125,2/20/2020,This place is all hype and over hyped at that. Food is overpriced for its quality. Servers were funny and cool. The magic is hit or miss. Mostly miss.

130,4/2/2018,"I can't justify giving the Magic Castle a 5*. Yes, I was entertained, mystified, and enjoyed walking through the castle.The great:The history of the castle, the magicians, and of course, Irma.The good:Everything is carpeted, there's restrooms that are available. The nooks and crannies where you can look and see - there's the haunted telephone booth (which was kinda broken), the private rooms where there are shows, the shows that you get tickets with your dinner, and the shows where you line up.The meh:You can't see every show. Times are listed, but people are waiting in lines, and it's hit or miss if you're able to attend the shows. :( We saw one show (with our dinner), one private show, and one line-up show. Also, we just happened to check out the show at the basement bar. The rooms can get confusing.The bad:$$ !!! Everything is so expensive. It used to be that the door fees were waived if you were having dinner - but the invite we got was $35/pp for door fees, plus an entree at dinner (entrees are $40+). The food was too salty! Way too salty. We ended up being hungry after we left :(. $15 for valet - we decided to uber/lyft there.Dress code: Strict. There's a coat check, but for men, you have to keep your jacket on at all times - outside of the dining room. The problem is, that the castle can get stuffy and warm.Ambiance 5*Uniqueness 5*Food 1*Overall 3*",3 star rating
131,5/18/2018,"If you get an invite you have to go! The shows here are amazing. People will harp on the food (you're required to eat dinner/lunch first and have an entree), but whatever thats the price of admission. So my advice is eat before hand somewhere else, and get the cheapest entree, its true the food is kinda underwhelming and expensive but again thats the price of admission.But after dinner........ Explore the castle don't just go to the big shows, there's many nooks and crannies in this place that have little sideshows and there's also traveling magicians doing impromptu shows at little side tables everywhere, so make sure you explore the joint.People always talk caca about the food, but what they dont tell you is that they have very reasonable (even good) prices for their drinks! And they have pretty well stocked bar. So go on come via taxi/lyft etc enjoy yourself and the magic. This place is the real deal.",5 star rating

133,9/19/2018,"This place is absolutely amazing!!! If you ever get the opportunity to be invited by a member or magician, say yes! The Magic Castle is known for being an exclusive, invite only club. It is 21+ except for their brunches. If you are curious to know what to wear, be sure to look at their website. There are very detailed instructions on how to dress. It is always better to overdress than underdress because they may not let you in if your attire is considered too casual.When you first arrive, there is a backdrop where you can take pictures. As you enter the building, to the right there is a gift shop and you check in inside the lobby. Once you go past the lobby, no more pictures! Everything else is up to memories from here! The food was delicious. I ordered the Beef Wellington with a side of lobster, the crab Mac and cheese, the Cheesy Garlic Bread, and Caprese Salad. The food was spot on! The cheesy garlic bread was the highlight of my meal, my party ordered 4 orders... The atmosphere is so elegant of course and the servers are wonderful. Our server, Stephanie, was so friendly and she did a perfect job serving my group of 12! Our dinner reservation was at 6 so we were given tickets to the main stage magic show for 8 PM. What I enjoyed about the magic shows was that each magician is unique and keeps everything interesting. The magic shows are LITERALLY MAGICAL. The BEST experience I have had! The best part is that I was able to volunteer in a couple acts. I believe the shows change on a weekly basis, priority seating goes to guests with reservations. Nothing sounds more perfect than a great dinner and magic shows. If you get invited, say yes! If you do come, make reservations! I am hoping to come back one day and would 100% recommend this to all my magic lovers out there.",5 star rating
134,8/31/2018,"For lack of a better way to put it - the evening was magical!!It was my first time going, and I was already trying to figure out how I can come back before the night was over. As a non-member, we had to pay a $25 fee and then have dinner. We chose a 6pm reservation, and I think it was the best way to go. We caught the 8pm main show, and then had the rest of the evening to wander and check out the smaller ones in the castle. The dinner was actually pretty good. Our server was knowledgeable about the wine and recommended a really nice bottle for the table. I had the:- garlic cheesy bread: ok, probably wouldn't get it again- sea bass in a miso sauce: good texture and flavor- banana cream pie: not overly sweet and really good ratios of banana, cream, and Nutella pie crust. The server said it's been the same recipe for over 25 years!! Now onto the magic!! It was all mind blowing. I do not know how any of it was done. There were some more mind boggling than others but all in all, still something we are talking about days after. It wasn't gimmicky at all. As my boyfriend puts it: it was an adult, classy magic show that made you feel like a kid again - that was a general consensus. The time flew by. We didn't experience most of what the castle has to offer. It was a blast and a half. We are anxious to go back!",5 star rating
135,12/30/2016,"The Magic Castle is the home of the Academy of Magical Arts and is exclusive to members and their guests. The AMA was founded by the Larsen family over 50 years ago who wanted to  advance the art of magic. By purchasing this property on Franklin Ave, the dream would come to fruition. I had the Magic Castle bookmarked for years, but I never knew anyone to invite me to this exclusive club and never imagined being able to experience the amazing magic I have heard so much about. It was until I was lucky to be invited to The Magic Castle by fellow Yelper, Stevo, who put together a little get together with his family, Nadine, Tim, Yuri, Van, Sue, and I. It also happened to be my birthday weekend so I was super stoked!To keep with the magical mystery no cameras are allowed once your enter through the bookcase. That's right, you enter by speaking some magical words to the owl and then cross through the bookcase. Since we arrived earlier than our dinner reservation, we were able to roam throughout the castle and catch a few shows. The shows are first come first serve and they do not allow you to save seats for your friends. I really loved all the amazing shows! Some of the magician we saw were Justin Willman, Brett Loudermilk, Dan Sperry, Derek Hughes, Ralf Gagel, and a few others. I even got to sit and be a part of a card trick in the close-up gallery since it was my birthday, super cool right?Dinner was a-ok as well. I ordered the Grilled Scottish Salmon served with lemon risotto and asparagus topped with lemon sauce. It was yummy and filling. Since it was my birthday I was also served a complimentary dessert and champagne. Since I do not drink I handed it over to Nadine who was double fisting this particular night!  If you ever get the opportunity to attend do not pass it up, you will not regret it!Thanks again to Stevo and Nadine for a birthday to remember!",5 star rating
136,4/3/2018,"What a magical evening! I have been wanting to attend The Magic Castle for over a decade. When the opportunity came, I booked a flight to LA just for this. Even though I called 3 months prior, our only choice for dinner reservations for four was at 9:45pm on a Saturday (it was Easter weekend, so I guess it was all booked already for earlier times). Upon arrival, we pulled up to valet. There's a backdrop next to the entrance for all to take the only photos here. Once you're checked in and enter the ""magical"" doors, no photography is allowed. This is also where you pay your entrance fee of $35 for Friday to Sundays ($25 on weekdays). Inside is reminiscent of a majestic, olden mansion. There's showrooms and magic shows all around with an upstairs, downstairs, and ground floor. Be sure to arrive 30 minutes prior to shows with set times because they fill up early and have very limited seating. I loved that waiters came around to take your drink orders while you were waiting in line though! If you don't get into the showing, they offer a couple random magic shows in the rooms downstairs, which were pretty impressive as well. I was even selected multiple times to go up and help with the magic tricks, which was pretty neat. If given the opportunity, take it! I walked away with a dollar and a rubber duck as a souvenir.As for the dinner portion, you will die of how amazing it smells every time you had to pass by the dining room while hungry. To start off, they did offer some complimentary bread and butter which was so necessary. As for my entree, I decided to go big with their special Tomahawk Steak ($79). This also came with a baked potato and vegetables. Even though I managed to finish the entire thing, I was overwhelmed. Trust me on this for all meat lovers, treat yourself to the tomahawk steak --so tender, so amazing, so delicious! Another high recommendation is their Cajun-Styled Prime Rib ($40 for 10oz / $49 for 14oz). Both of the guys could not finish their 14oz prime rib and had to get take-out boxes, so there's a clear picture of how huge of a meat this is. I've had plenty of prime ribs before, but we all had to admit that the way The Magic Castle made theirs was absolutely divine and easily the best prime rib we've ever had. Make sure you get the cajun-style, which is available upon request. The kick of spice truly brings out a remarkable flavor. It's funny that even though this place is known for it's exclusivity and magic, I am more eager than ever to return for the food.Even though our dinner reservation times was the last one scheduled for the night, it was a perfect ending. We all had major food coma after our dinner, so I can't imagine if we started off with dinner and then tried exploring the castle afterwards. With dinner, we got guaranteed tickets to the big show afterwards, which was a splendid ending to the night.",5 star rating

Overall it was a good experience.",5 star rating
138,9/5/2018,"Just a heads up, the experience is great but the food is mediocre at best. However, this unique experience is unlike any other so I have to consider this a five star location. Valet is currently priced at $15 regardless if you know a magician. I was very fortunate to know an old friend performing on the main stage of the venue and he was able to add me to the guest list which saved me the cover charge. Hats off to the extremely polite valet runners who are patient with helping take pictures and also allowing me to park temporarily on the side when my magician friend wanted to come outside to say hi to us. The acts inside are amazing and there's just so much to do and see. I was fortunate to be one of the first guests in some rooms so my gf and I had the opportunity to sit within arm lengths of magicians while they performed their act. I also enjoy the secrecy and respect of no phone usage they have within the castle. It's obvious who the members of the castle are because of their shiny pins and they talk nonstop about little Easter eggs or facts about the castle. I was pretty disappointed in the food because for the price we paid (+$100) it should be quite amazing. We ordered the beef Wellington w/ mushroom sauce and the prime rib. The food came out in about 10 minutes which makes me suspect that they had a lot of protein precooked and ready to go on a food warmer. The beef Wellington was tender and of good quality but the portion was a joke. They only give you half a Wellington instead of the whole. The prime rib was decent and had a generous portion. The only issue is that it was tougher and not as fatty as other prime ribs (kinda like a black angus quality prime rib). The carrots were not fully cooked but skinned very well, and the mashed potato tasted as expected. The mushroom sauce recommended by our waiter was quite amazing and the server was extremely generous with the horse radish. Overall, I wish I could skip out on dinner (unfortunately there's a $70 charge x every person on your reservation for the credit card you leave on file when you call in for a reservation if you skip on having dinner) and just enjoy the show and environment here. It's still one of the most unique experiences I've had in LA so I have to give props to the castle.",5 star rating

I heard the dinner is average but very pricey.You feel very privileged being here. No photos are allowed at all time. Do not forget to dress up and wear a tie or bow tie.

141,5/2/2018,"Be prepared to spend an arm and a leg, but it is definitely a must do if you ever get an invitation. In the heart of Hollywood, Magic Castle sits on top of a small hill where it is super exclusive to get in.Valet is $15 dollars and you are not allowed to self park. Given the opportunity, try to carpool with your group if you can. Cover for our party was $35 a head with a required dinner. We got the Rib Eye which costed us around $40-100 per plate. The food looked good but everything was bland and the meal was definitely not worth the price. Drinks run for around $13-15 dollars and it can add up.There are a few theaters scattered out throughout the night and each has a performing magician and your experience will vary based on the magician available during that evening. After you have dinner, you get a ticket to see the main show. There are a variety of magicians and it was tons of fun seeing the different experience levels and styles of trick.

On the night we went the main headliner was unable to perform, so we got the B list. Another shorter show was funny an all used the audience on stage.Food - preset menu.

Highly recommend exploring all the nooks and crannies and don't be shy about asking people to show you some magic.",4 star rating
147,3/4/2018,"The castle is beautiful, the performers are enchanting, and it's not hard to find magic. The magic finds you. I found that the Close Up Gallery actually offered a better experience than the larger shows because it was easier to get up close and personal to the magic and to participate in the show, and the magicians performing there are so happy to involve their smaller audience. I absolutely enjoyed the entertainers and even got a card from one of them to book for a party! Drinks are overpriced, but what do you expect? It's a specialty bar in LA. If you aren't ready to drop $14 for a drink then you're in the wrong place. I was a little tilted that they didn't give me the rest of the Red Bull with my vodka Red Bull but I've since been informed that that practice is a trashy club thing. Oh well. They have a somewhat generous pour so the price isn't a concern to me.So we've come to the reason for my two star review. The food. There are extremely limited vegetarian/vegan options with just 1 or 2 per night. I know that ordering an entree is mandatory so I asked the waitress if we could order an equal monetary value in sides or soup/salad and she said no, it was against policy and we had to get an entree. If you're going to force someone to buy an entree, at least put some effort into dietary restricted options instead of just phoning it in. I got a vegetarian risotto and the risotto was wet, the vegetables were bland and under seasoned, and the whole meal was frankly unpleasant. I barely picked at it and paid $37 for the experience. My fiancé got the tofu and the texture was extremely soft and downright repulsive when it cooled, and the sauce was just not good. I've had far superior tofu dishes from Pick Up Stix. Together we paid almost $80 for food we took two bites of, when we were more than happy to pay the required amount for food that we'd actually eat. All the meat eaters in my party loved the meal so this is a specifically vegetarian/vegan problem but it really put a damper on my night and left a bad taste in my mouth (literally) about the experience.",2 star rating

149,10/10/2016,"Magical day @MagicCastle_AMA!It was quite a magical experience from the moment I laid my eyes on The Magic Castle.It's hard not to spot this gigantic Victorian mansion on Franklin Avenue in Hollywood. The moment my friend's car got onto Magic Drive, I knew we were in for a treat.I loved the lobby of the castle with the various books around the walls. Hmm there's something special about that owl on the shelf...he's your secret to getting in! With one phrase, the little owl let us in to a whole new world.The moment you're let in, it truly is a whole new world. The antique decor is quite a sight. With the castle being built in 1909, you can just imagine all the history in this place. There is some thing to see at almost every corner. There's plenty of unique portraits and lots of surprises along the way! If you see a telephone booth, go inside and you might get a phone call and see uh...something ;). Inside the bathroom, there is a special mirror. Don't blink or you may miss a special treat! It's creepy, neat and interesting.We were here for a private party that was set at brunch time. Brunch offerings consisted of lot of delicious items such as custom made omelets, crab legs, chicken marsala, cheese ravioli, prime rib, Polish sausage and homestyle Yukon potatoes! I really enjoyed the ravioli and my custom made omelet. There were also plenty of delectable desserts from cream puffs to gigantic cookies! The white chocolate chip cookie was amazing. I also a big fan of their Sundae bar. The vanilla bean ice cream was so smooth and creamy. Drink wise they offered coffee, soda and bottomless mimosas! I would definitely say come here hungry because there's a lot of food to take in.During the brunch, someone came around to give us our tickets to the Palace of Mystery. There was also a magician who came by our table and did an amazing card trick. He had me write my name on a card and later on found it in the deck. I am still in awe on how the card with my name moved from the deck of cards into a sealed envelope inside his wallet.After brunch, we were off to the main show at the Palace of Mystery. That day Greg Wilson and Hans Davis were performing. Greg was entertaining. He did the pull a rabbit out of the hat trick. Hans was amazing. He did a bunch of hand shadow puppets that included ET, Darth Vader and more!After the Palace of Mystery, my friend and I explored the castle. I saw Irma's room with the piano being played by a ghost. We saw more magic at the Close Up Gallery. Performing there was sixteen year old Ryan Dong.  I truly enjoyed visiting The Magic Castle. It's was a magical time filled with wonder and awe.",4 star rating

151,1/22/2018,"Was invited to the Magic Castle for a private event, & it was fabulous!  A combination of dark, mysterious, elegant, & sexy, the Magic Castle did not disappoint.  The food was delicious (looking at you...you delicious lamb chops), & the drinks at the bars were spot-on.  We saw a show in the Palace of Mystery (hilarious), & the close-up acts were great.  Loved exploring the dark mysterious corners of the Castle, & Irene was a blast!Valet was very nice & left complimentary bottles of water for us in our car.If you have the opportunity, get dressed, & spend a fun, elegant evening at the Magic Castle!!!",5 star rating
152,2/19/2019,"Whoever thinks this place is good experience, they obviously don't value money. How do people give this a 4 or 5 star?  Just because it's a historical legendary place in LA?  Bogus.  The people that give it 5 stars aren't from LA.  $38 for magical mushroom dish is just ridiculous. My girlfriend didn't want an entree and she ordered side mac and cheese.  Welp, an entree is required so they charged her $26 for a side of mac and cheese.  A martini were the best thing I experienced.$14 for garlic cheese bread?  I get that this is an educational ""academy"" and has the ""legendary"" status that only a few people get to attend in their lifetime in Los Angeles.  I'm grateful for the invite we received and eating in the Houdini Room was pretty cool...except there was no music/atmosphere, and the table was fit to seat 7-8 people.  It made talking to friends feel like you're yelling across the Grand Canyon.Magic show was meh too.  45 minutes for 2 people, 1 guy was sort of ok, the host was better and the last performance was juggling...which isn't really magic.  Sat in the back because the restaurant waiters didn't tell us to go early to get better seats, so we showed up from the restaurant literally at 9:55pm...everyone had already been seated and I was stuck right next to a pillar.All in all Magic Castle, if you want to spend $70/2 ppl, and 177$/2ppl for diner style food, by all means go to this establishment.",2 star rating
153,5/30/2017,"Went here on Sunday for dinner and magic. My friend got an invite and we were excited to check it out. Upon arrival there are a line of cars waiting to valet (no self park) and once you get dropped off their is a short line to check. There is a $30 entrance fee unless you are member and valet is $13. The dinner service is spread out into different rooms since the structure of the building is a vintage mansion. We had dinner in a room that was formerly the master bedroom. Entrees are about $40 each, apps around $12 and drink are about $14. We we're at the castle from 6pm to 1:30am so the cost of drinks really adds up. Also the signature cocktails appear to be pre-mixed and not hand crafted. The food was not bad, a bit pricey but pretty good quality. I had the diver scallops which weren't as tender as I like them to be but still good. On to the magic which takes place in a bunch of different rooms and settings at different time slots. The first show we saw was Murray / Lefty. The room for this show did not have theatre seating so all the seats were on one level which made it really hard to see in the back. Murray had a very cocky Hollywood feel to his act and at one point was giving away a poster and DVD of himself. I actually enjoyed Lefty's act a bit more which was simple magic tricks but flowed well to the music without any talking. We saw a couple smaller side show acts which were mostly card tricks and although they are very impressive you can only see so many card tricks back to back before your eyes start to get tired. My fav card trick guy was as an Asian guy named John who made some fun Jay-z references. My main complaint with this spot is that a lot of the main acts were full even if you got in line for them 45 mins before the show. It sucks being in formal wear and spending most of the night in lines. Also our host initially told us we didn't need tix for the shows we wanted to see and then we later found out we did. It caused us to almost miss our friends show that we came there to see. I think they can be more clear about the process for seeing shows once inside. My favorite show of the night was Joel Ward and his nerdy side kick. Their act was as much comedy as it was magic and we had a great time watching them. Overall this was a fun dressed up night out but probably wouldn't do it more than once.",4 star rating

156,1/27/2019,"Tacky Castle. I love magic and this place is anything but magical. Yuck.Totally pathetic. Ineffective/indifferent staff, cheap yet over-priced assembly line food, and way too many people being herded through dated sticky and oily surfaces. I'll have to visit the dry cleaners for sure this week. (And add that to my total bill for the evening, which was about $150 per person....I thought we were ""guests""!?!)They keep the cheap cocktail dress section of Ross in business with that ridiculous dress code, that's for sure.We spent our evening dodging crowds and staircases to see a few tired old magic tricks involving 1960s-style cards, hoops, handkerchiefs, and confetti while blowing cold stale air on us as we sat in dirty, cheap folding chairs. So enchanting! I can only hope they treat the animals they use humanely, but i'm not holding my breath on that one. Think i'll make some phone calls. (Speaking of which, if you love animals don't even think about it; besides the potential abuse, the vegan options are dismal.)The best part was and is laughing at how pathetic it all is and agreeing with all of the other bad reviews here... thank god for Yelp! :))I feel abused myself and should've looked here before going. If you want a great evening of magic try Black Rabbit Rose in Hollywood. Top notch.",1 star rating
157,7/12/2016,"Valet = $13. Entrance Fee = $30. Drinks = approx $15/each. Dinner = approx $40/entree... Taking some Magic to-go... Priceless ;) A special thank you to Stevo and his family for extending their invitation to us fellow yelpers and also to auntie Nadine for coordinating our trip to the Magic Castle. Also shout outs to Yuri, Tim, Sue and birthday girl Gloria!! If you guys have seen that episode on How I Met Your Mother, Barney always says a magician's best audience is a drunk crowd. Well they sure keep those drinks coming here at Magic Castle. I am actually impressed that the attendants are able to take our drinks down while we are in line for the show and somehow locate us even after we are sitting. They also have quite a few bars located throughout the Magic Castle to keep everyone hydrated with liquor. Their drinks are definitely on the pricey side, but they are pretty strong so that's cool. I really enjoyed all of the shows we were able to catch. A few of the tricks were basic and I have a few theories how it may have occurred... but then there were also really impressive tricks where I have no clue how it happens. I really enjoyed all of the shows. I felt all excited like a little kid again :) I heard the dinner reservations here are very fancy. You have to know someone fancy to score a dinner reservation... so good thing we know fancy people. For dinner I had the Academy Beef Wellington ($40) which is a beef tenderloin wrapped in puff pastry. It came with a side of garlic whipped potatoes and seasoned veggies (baby carrots and broccolini). Dinner was pretty good, but I felt like it fell short of our expectations for what it could have been. In general I prefer my potatoes with more texture, but that's just me. My veggies were a bit underdone and the meat was a bit tough. I really liked our waiter though. I really wish I remembered his name, but he did an incredible job keeping my drinks coming. I had a lot of fun! If someone offers you an invitation, you should definitely check it out. Something magical might happen while you're there :P",4 star rating
158,3/18/2018,"This is one of the coolest experiences I have ever had. We were one of the lucky ones to get an invite from a member and off we went. We were kind of last minute so we had the late dinner which I think was 9pm ish and a 11pm show. We got there however when it opened at 5 and I am very glad we did. We went from show to show and saw 6 total. All different types of magic, up close, prestidigitation, and a main stage show. Everything was awesome. I got to participate in some of them and rarely could see them palm a card etc. They were truly fantastic magicians. Where I was sitting a lot of the time, because I like to be up close, I should have been able to see some of the tricks and I couldn't! Some truly great magic. The random show at the bar that we just happened to sit at and catch ended up being one of our favorites! Dinner was very good. I had the Oso Bucco and Andrew had a steak and they were both fantastic. We had oysters rockefeller for an appetizer and the service was great. While the food was pricy, it wasn't ridiculous. We also drank all night it seemed and our tab was under $100 so drinks were fair, I think I had 2 wines and 2 beers and Andrew 4 beers so that was decent pricing for a place like this! Tiny gift shop but we were able to get a couple glasses to remember our time there! If we lived there, we would not hesitate for a membership, it was that awesome!",5 star rating
159,8/22/2018,"My fiancé surprised me by booking a room at the hotel and making us dinner reservations. We had an amazing night! We were celebrating our 5 year anniversary as a couple and they gave us cute pins. Our waiter (I hope I remember your name correctly) Rick was super attentive. The food was delicious! I had the beef Wellington and he had the tomahawk. At the end of dinner they surprised us w champagne and ice cream in a cute chocolate top hat and tickets to a show. The staff in general are very pleasant! We also met some super nice members (peter, Ricardo and Sebastian). They shared some castle history, recommendations and even did some magic for us. We definitely want to go back. My fiancé is worried he won't be able to top this anniversary lol. I love their dress code. It's always fun to get dressed up!",5 star rating
160,6/25/2018,"I want to first say it's pretty funny to see the number of people who posted pictures of inside the castle when the business requested no photography of any time across any social media before actually entering into the building. By the way, I don't mean funny cute...more like not courteous....That being said, let's start the actual review...I came here with my boyfriend and some coworkers. I like how they setup the place and the number of shows that go on before, during, and after your main show (aka the one after your meal)Definitely uber/lyft over if you don't want to valet ($15). Our over charge was $25 but we went on a Thursday Night. Not sure if the rate fluctuates base on days since I see others reporting $35 for cover charge. Come early so you can check out as much shows as possible. We spend about 4 hours just watching different shows. For dinner my friends and I shared food so we were able to try variety of things. If you like seafood then add the milton style on top of your filet mignon / other choices. The mean itself came out to be about $100 per person since we ordered a bottle of wine, entree per person, plus 3 desserts. If this is expensive for you but you still want to experience it, I would recommend saving this for a special occasion.",5 star rating
161,6/27/2018,"Moved to LA 6 years ago and last night was my first time to magic castle! It's just as great as everyone says it is! Truly a unique experience that really can't be replicated anywhere else. The classiness of the establishment in its patrons, environment and staff really makes you feel like your a part of old Hollywood rubbing elbows with the elites. I love the strict dress attire because it does set the establishment apart of a lounge or club where its border line acceptable to show up in flip flops... parking can be challenging as well but we just parked in an adjacent neighborhood and took a ride share in. Our first stop was the Close up room with a magician called Zebrecky. This was recommended to us by our friend and he was easily all of our favorite the entire evening.  A waitress came by to get our drink orders while we waiting in line and returned quickly so little waiting for drink. I will say that you do have to plan out what shows you want to go to because the lines fill up quickly and they have limited seating in all of their rooms. Did not get a chance to eat this time around but the food smelled good as we walked through the dining area.",5 star rating
162,11/21/2019,Wow! What a amazing experience!!!! Rich Freeman is probably the best magician I have ever seen! He is also super knowledgeable about everything Magic Castle! So he totally made this an amazing experience! Loved the ambience and decor! We met Rich as soon as we walked in. Poof! He just appeared! Pretty magical. The tour and private show that Rich gave us was also mesmerizing! Oh I also loved how wherever you looked there was a magician preforming for guests. Even some of the bartenders were Magicians! We went to a couple of shows too. Vegas quality  but way more intimate. Drinks were good and even the bar food was tasty. This place is definitely a must!,5 star rating

165,6/5/2016,"Wow what an experience.  I was invited along with three others to attend a memorable night.  Prior to going I have heard some things like the food isn't good and the shows are pretty cool.  Well, from my own experience, we had a pretty amazing time overall.  We luckily were able to make reservations one day ahead of time.  Our reservation was at 6pm and we arrived at opening time, 5pm.  Once we arrived we checked in and went through their doors.  That's when the magic happens.  No photos and no video recording of any kind.  Once you enter, there is their grand bar.  I had to get my dirty martini that was made super strong and enough for the entire night.  Since we arrived early we were able to watch two shows right before dinner.The first show consisted of card tricks.  He was a good starter for us.  The second show blew my mind.  I luckily was able to participate in most of the shows, and this one included.  This show had a younger guy who made things change right in front of our faces.  What?!  He gave me two balls to hold in the palm of my hand.  Then when I went to open it there were a bunch of balls that rolled out.  WTF?!  Once it was dinner time, we made our way to the dining area.  Drinks came out immediately.  To start we went with a bottle of red wine and their shrimp cocktail which was eh.  For my entree, I went with the scallops dish.  It was pan seared perfectly.  There was the right amount of sauce.  It was a light dish but perfect since I wasn't super hungry.  We also ordered crab mac n cheese to share which I didn't taste much crab but was still very good.  I had a bite of their steak which was very good and their seabass which was also good.  To our dinner, we had a bite of their chocolate cake, creme burlee and banana cream pie.  That banana cream pie was to die for.  It's a must get if you want dessert.  Our service we very friendly, very sweet, and very helpful.  He gave us tickets after and gave great recommendations on the order of shows we should attend.  After dinner, we made it to our ticketed show which was the largest show.  There they had three top magicians perform.  My favorites were the magician that had our friend come up on stage and the hot younger guy that made an ipad disappear.  Once we saw that show, we went over to see the popular Alberto de Figueiredo.  I participated in this one as well, along with my friend.  After those two shows we made our way to the bar where the bartender did some magic right up front with us with some card tricks.  That was a lot of fun to interact with them one on one.  Lastly, our last show of the night was in a small room downstairs.  The magician there was a high school teacher who had my sister come up on stage to participate.  He was pretty amazing and a great magic show to end the night.Besides a great dinner and unbelievable shows, I enjoyed walking around the castle and looking at all the details.  I love the dark vibe of the place and the exquisite work they put into it.  All the photos, painting and decor around the castle were beautiful to me.  Each room has it's own look.  It definitely had some class.  We ended up leaving around 11pm so we spend quite a bit of time there.  I was really glad I got to experience coming here and I recommend if you get the chance.",5 star rating
166,12/3/2018,"Magic Castle is one of those places that is true Hollywood (sounds like an oxymoron, I know). I've wanted to visit for a long time, but only recently did I become acquainted with a member who kindly gave me a guest pass. This grants access to you and five others, and you are required to make a dinner reservation prior to your visit.I recommend calling as soon as you receive your guest pass; they book up months in advance, especially on weekends. If you are aiming for a specific date to visit and it isn't available, they can put you on the waitlist. In our case, I wanted to go on a certain date with five others and it was at capacity, but I called a few days later to see what other openings they might have for just me and one other person. We ended up with a dinner reservation at 6pm on a Sunday. The folks from the reservations line were always incredibly polite and explained the process as thoroughly as possible. They require a credit card when making a reservation, and no shows are charged $30/person.A visit to the Magic Castle is pricy. The valet is $15, the door fee for any guests not accompanied by a member is $25 Monday-Thursday / $35 Friday-Sunday, and each guest is required to order an entree or pay $70/person for non-dining. Be aware of this before you go, and look at the prices on the menu, so you can make sure your wallet is prepared. Also, the clubhouse has a strict dress code that you can find on their site (formalwear, with exceptions for ethnic/military/religious attire).After missing the entrance to the valet and almost entering Yamashiro (which is directly after Magic Castle), we arrived around 5pm. The Castle had beautiful Christmas decorations, including a photo setup with a sleigh. The person at the door retrieved my information and advised me of the no photo policy past the lobby. Once inside, we checked in, paid for the valet and door fee, and followed the hostess' instructions to magically get in.The Magic Castle is in a large mansion, and the setup is such where there are shows in many rooms and theaters spread throughout the space. There is supposedly a close-up show that starts at 5pm, but we waited until 5:35pm and there was still no entertainer, so not wanting to miss our dinner reservation, we left. We instead visited a smaller venue and watched a couple more intimate shows before heading up to the dining room.For dinner my partner ordered the chicken, I ordered the 6oz filet mignon with the whiskey peppercorn sauce (per our server's recommendation), and we shared the brussels sprouts with no bacon. The chicken had a great crispy skin, and the sauce was fantastic. My steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare, but I wish there was a crispier crust on top. The vegetables were a little bland, though. The brussels sprouts were tasty and interesting, but I'm not sure I'd order them again. I had a glass of wine with my food and my partner had the Ringmaster, which was unique but I think required a little more shaking as he eventually reached what we refer to as a ""pocket of alcohol"". We then each had a glass of port to round out the meal. Though I will admit that the food was incredibly overpriced, it was still tasty, so at least it wasn't disappointing. After our meal, our server gave us two tickets for the 8pm show in the Palace of Mystery, with opening act Greg Otto and headliners Kyle and Mistie Knight. This theater is fairly large, and gives priority to those who had a dinner reservation. Won't spoil anything for you, but the Knights certainly know how to put on a show, and they even allowed the audience to get very interactive!Upon the conclusion of this show, we also wandered into the Parlor of Prestidigitation, which is a little smaller and quite cute. Chris Rose performed for us and his show was a fantastic, warm, friendly sight to behold. This was one of my favorites.We also wandered around and beheld many of the sights, including the piano played by Irma the ghost, a duplicate of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion sign, and glass cases with magic history. I was overwhelmed in the best way possible. We watched two small shows in the Hat and Hare Pub--which allows impromptu shows performed exclusively by members of the Academy of Magical Arts--and another upstairs. I even walked away with a trinket from one of these shows!Finally, we ended our evening at the Library Bar to watch Hannibal's show. It was far more interactive and lighthearted, and was my favorite because we sat right at the bar and participated in some of his tricks. He's fantastic. One bummer is I ordered a Sazerac and it didn't exactly come out right, but I am also a purist with that specific cocktail and I can count on one hand how many places have done it properly.As long as you are aware of the costs associated with a visit, can conduct yourself appropriately, and have an open mind, you're bound to have fun. I noted some small hiccups so I won't award the full 5 stars but still a great experience!",4 star rating
167,11/20/2019,"I think you definitely should go at least once.  It's a unique experience and some of the magic shows are quite good.The Pros:* Mostly Good Magic Shows* Large, Medium and Small Venue shows... you can see all the details* One-on-one demos... slight of hand.  Really fun* The food is getting much better - even than a few years ago.* Valet Parking* Irma = Ghost Piano player in bar - takes requests - fun.* Well organized.Cons:* Prices:  $25 admission, $15 Parking, $40 - $50 per entree + beverages... it's going to cost you $100 per person minimum.  Just make it one fixed price and avoid the nickel dining.* Crowds... damn - tight fit even on weekdays* Lines for shows... not as bad as Disney - but get in line early so you can squeeze in.* Focus on Magic and forget the comedy unless you are a pro* You must wear Business or Formal attire (Suit and tie for men or sport coast - no Jeans... business wear or dressy for women.",3 star rating
168,6/10/2016,"The Magic Castle! After 20 odd years of chatter, anticipation, rumors, and stories of this place while growing up as a kid, I FINALLY made it in! I thought this moment would never come. I'd like to start by saying that I really want to give this place a bad review, because the manager Joey really did rub me and my friend the wrong way, but honestly, I can't. I came here last night (Thursday, 6/9/16) for my first time ever and had an absolute blast. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here, and highly recommend everyone to check this place out if given the chance. Though pricey, it's definitely worth splurging for.As many already know and have previously stated, this restaurant/club/bar/entertainment venue is invite only and pretty exclusive. You either have to be a member, know a member, or know someone that knows a member. If you don't, the only other way to get in is to book a hotel room at the magic castle hotel next door. One booked room (~$250) will get you 6 passes into the magic castle club, but plan ahead if trying to make reservations for a Friday or Saturday night (the best nights here), as those spots often fill up a few weeks in advance. For a Thursday night, same week reservations into the club is possible, and that's what we did/how we got in. For taking out-of-towners, this is the best last-minute way to show them a glimpse of something magical.When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted by the hostess, who confirmed our reservation and gave us an itinerary of the shows for the night. To get inside, you must say the secret words ""Open Sesame"" to the owl on the bookshelf. Once you say those words to the owl, the bookshelf will slide open, leading you to the secret passageway into the club.The dining room is upstairs. Once seated, the waitress came over and explained the menu, along with some additional off-menu items that sounded delicious. Service was quick and efficient. Our waitress was very knowledgable about the hotel's history and helpful in showing us where to go. Very friendly and truly top notch service all-around.The food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. Do not listen to the other yelpers that complain about the prices and the food quality here. For what you get, prices are VERY reasonable. For $49, I ordered a 14 oz prime rib, ordered medium rare, which came with mashed potatoes and vegetables, as my main dish. For an appetizer, I tried the seared ahi tuna, priced at $16.Both dishes were absolutely exquisite. The tuna was masterfully marinated in a soy ginger vinaigrette, and topped with a mini seaweed salad and masago. The tuna tasted fresh and I could tell it was quality. The prime rib was huge! This slab of meat was about 2 inches thick and took up well over half of my plate. I seriously think it was more like 20 ounces. It came perfectly cooked and was among the best prime rib I have ever had. Food quality, flavor/taste, quantity, and presentation: A+! I was stuffed.After finishing our meal we wondered around the castle, which contains 14 bars, a myriad of secret rooms, and non-stop Magic shows. The castle is grand, and there really is a lot to take in. From the piano that plays whatever song you tell it to, to the haunted dungeon and more, I can stay entertained here for hours and hours.The best show of the night was the main one after dinner, that the waitress gives you guaranteed tickets to. Show up to shows roughly 30 mins before they start if you want a good seat/view. Most of the side shows were generally average to me, but the main show blew my mind for sure. All the magicians are pretty funny and interactive.For those looking for bar prices, beers are $9, cocktails are generally $14, and glasses of wine range around $10-14. Beer options include Golden Road IPA, Lagunitas IPA, some kind of red ale, Stella, and a few more. I highly recommend coming here when given the opportunity. You will not regret it. I had a blast, and I hope you do too!",5 star rating
169,2/8/2018,"Going to The Magic Castle was seriously on my bucket list for the longest time, so when we got a random opportunity to go one night during our recent vacation we JUMPED at the chance to go! Honestly this was one of the most entertaining night out we'd ever had! It's a beautiful, old Victorian style mansion that reminds me of old Hollywood glamour. Everyone is dressed to the nines (you have to, it's part of their dress code) And is ready to have fun and watch the magicians at work! When we first arrived, we had no idea where to go so we just wandered around. Every twist and turn into a hallway or bar or room had magicians doing tricks with small groups or a small audience. Those were very fun! We got in line for the main show which was also very entertaining but personally I liked the smallest theater the most as it was only about 12 of us in the room and it was a GREAT show. It was very intimate and you come out wondering how anything was possible. Overall, if you get the opportunity to be invited to the Magic Castle, GO!!! Don't even hesitate!",5 star rating

This really classed up the feeling of the place.I figured the food would be an afterthought to the magic. Seeing the prices I was certain the food was expensive to compensate for the magic. However, the food was amazing. We had the beef wellington, filet mignon, and roasted cauliflower. Each dish was superb and the service was flawless. Our waiter was highly knowledgeable of all the food. Lastly, the steak was perfectly cooked and buttery soft.After dinner we went to see the magic. Rocco and Scott and Puck were all excellent. Scott was especially funny and they were all part magician and part comedian. I would highly recommend the magic castle.

172,5/21/2016,"Growing up, I've only seen magic on television that usually showed me how they did it afterwards, so magic to me wasn't really considered ""magic,"" until I came here! Seriously, my entire perspective towards magic has completely changed after one night at the Magic Castle!This place is exclusively for members only and their guests. I love exclusive places because they actually work really hard to maintain and keep their members happy. The number one rule here is no pictures allowed, so shame on everybody who took photos! The security guard strictly told us no foodporn, outfit porn, or any type of porn pictures! Hahah!! The second strict rule here is the dress code. You have to dress nice in order to get in, which makes sense.Admission was $30 a person and remember to grab a schedule of the magic shows on your way in. As you walk around there are plenty of shows you can visit on the schedule or visit small tables of magic located all around the castle. I personally liked the small tables of magic over the shows a little bit more because they were a lot more intimate. The magic in all the shows/tables were outstanding. I can tell they work extremely hard to provide such an outstanding show; leaving me amazed after each one. I would also recommend arriving early because I felt like the night went by so quickly that we were not able to see as many shows as I wished.The food here was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. I ordered the Herb-Rubbed Slow Roasted Prime Rib and I like how they have two sizes to chose from in case your hungry or really hungry. My friend ordered the Academy Beef Wellington and they were both pretty good. For the sides, we enjoyed the Sautéed Seasonal Mushrooms, Truffle French Fries, and the Four Cheese Garlic Bread, which I would highly recommend on all three of those. The sides were really good.I would highly recommend anybody who ever get a chance to go here to definitely not let the opportunity pass you by. It is a once in a lifetime experience! Keep the magic going!",5 star rating
173,2/2/2018,"WOW. We got SO lucky being invited to THE magic castle. We were invited as guests literally a few hours before we arrived and this completely made our trip.I felt like such a little kid upon entering this place. It has a very magical feel and look to it and reminds me of a mansion back in the 1960s/70; it feels dated but there is so much history in this building. The magic castle itself is a mansion and a maze to navigate. I think there are three different floors and each floor is so unique with so many small rooms/areas for you to view small and large magic shows. We saw several magic acts that night and I wished I remembered some of their names! We saw a couple of up and coming magicians and some veteran ones; we even saw a magician that was on ""Penn and Teller, fool us"". Although he didn't fool them, he definitely fooled us! I really liked that some of the acts were intimate and had a small viewing audience and some are actually interactive which was really cool. I have never seen magic this up close and personal; it was such a surreal experience for me and I hope to be able to come again.We came on a Thursday night around 9.30pm and we stayed until almost midnight! Most people who come have to buy dinner as well along with attending the shows but since we were a special ""VIP"" guest for an actual performer we were able to just pay the cover costs and that was it. One item checked off our bucket list!!",5 star rating
174,5/28/2016,"I had such a great experience at the Magic Castle! If you happen to get an invite, don't think twice...just go! My friend is taking a six-week class here and can invite up to 3 people for the whole duration of the program. When you go with a student, you don't have to pay for the cover charge and you don't need to have dinner reservations...you can just walk-in with the student! We decided to have dinner here though because we wanted the whole magic castle experience.We were here on a Tuesday night at around 730 and it wasn't too busy- no valet backlog and no line inside the lobby. Once we got there and valet parked, we headed inside where we paid for the valet ($13) and had our IDs checked at the front desk. If you get there ahead of your party, you can wait inside if you have dinner reservations. We had an 8 pm dinner reservation so when we got there a few minutes before that, we had a little bit of time to go around and explore the place. There were shows scheduled before 8 pm but we didn't get to see those so maybe come earlier if you want to catch at least one show before dinner. I have read some bad reviews about the food and service but during the night of our visit, service was impeccable- from the valet guys, front desk ladies, waiters, and security! Hmmm but the bartender, not so much. Food was great too. We had the calamari and pork belly sliders for appetizers and for our entrees, I had the filet mignon ($39), while my fiance had the tomahawk steak ($72). The meats were tender and flavorful. I also loved their salted caramel creme brulee! Our bill came up to about $425 for our party of 4, including alcoholic drinks, tax and tip. Do I think it's worth $100 per person? I mean, dinner + magic shows (you can watch 6 shows if you time it right!)...I think it's worth it! We were able to watch 3 shows that night but you can watch more than that if you come early and if you time it right. Since we had dinner reservations, we had guaranteed tickets to the main theater. If you don't have tickets, you can wait on standby. You'd also have to get in line maybe 10-15 mins before each show in the other rooms, depending on how big the crowd is that night, so you can get a seat inside. The night we went, it wasn't too crowded but there were still people who were turned away because the room was already at capacity. The magic shows were great although there were some tricks that were too cliché (bunny appearing out of a hat, circus rings, etc.). The highlight of the night though was the late night close up show by the magician Bebel...really amazing! I am convinced he is the real-life Dumbledore!Don't forget to adhere to the dress code...suits for the gentlemen, dresses for the ladies. I came here in a short dress and heels and I didn't feel underdressed. I saw a few women in long cocktail gowns though so if you want to show up in those and an updo, I don't think you will feel out of place.",4 star rating
175,3/26/2018,The magic castle experience was hands down one of the best nights of my life! There was no doubt that the talented magicians truly enjoyed the performances they put on for us! To gain access to the main show all guests are required to have dinner in the castle. They accommodated our group of 12 very comfortably. I had the miso glazed sea bass and found it was delicious and just the perfect size if you're lookin for a lighter option! There are no photos allowed past the castle lobby but it's honestly refreshing to go phone-less for a night and just enjoy the fancy ambiance! You can however snap a photo inside the lobby (:Mike Pisciotta in the Hat & Hare pub was such a wonderful performer in an intimate setting. Serving up not just great drinks but great close up magic too!!We ended our night with David Gabbay's 12:30 late night show and I'm so glad we didn't miss him because (3 disaronno & cranberry's aside) I left that room mindfucked by his magic! Lol By far my favorite part of the whole night!Thank you Magic Castle!!,5 star rating
176,3/8/2018,"What an amazing birthday at the Castle! Everyone should visit the Castle at least once in their lifetime. So much history in this place. The entire ambiance is truly magical.Since it was my birthday, I solely wanted to save my stomach room for drinks, they make them nice and strong at the bars. Started off with some Oysters Rockefeller and went with the small filet mignon for dinner, I would recommend sauce for the steak. They also surprised me with some ice cream for dessert in a chocolate hat.I would definitely explore as much as you can when in the castle, you never know when a magician will pop up with an intimate show.",5 star rating
177,10/9/2019,"The magic was 5 stars. The food and service was Zero stars. Worst service ever. The server thought it was appropriate to mock some of the guests dietary restrictions. Made political jokes, and gave trouble when the bill had food on it that we did not recieve. Literally felt like he wanted to get fired. It ruined our dinner and rest of the evening. I have never experienced such  rude behavior when dining. Im sad that I spent money to look nice and go the this establishment to one be treated terrible.",1 star rating
178,1/21/2020,"Food was great (although pricey). Service all throughout the Castle was fantastic - our group needed help finding a show to go to, especially late at night. Each show offered something a bit different which kept things nice and fresh. That was an incredible experience and one I'll never forget for the rest of my life, Jeff Kaylor legit gave me a headache from all of the magic when he performed at a table we had sat down to - especially because he kept making me choose cards during his peformance. Only seen a small bit of magic shows in my life (first time at Magic Castle) and Jason Kaylor's honestly blew me away. I just feel so grateful to be able experience something like that. If I am to return to the Magic Castle I will definitely be checking to see if Jeff Kaylor will be there as well. Incredibly talented magician.",5 star rating
179,5/17/2019,"This is definitely something you have to experience at least once. If I had the opportunity, I would definitely come back again. Food: Even though it was pretty overpriced, the food was really good. I had the prime ribs and the meat was so tender. It definitely wasn't the best piece of meat I've ever tasted, but it was still very enjoyable. Magic shows: The magic shows were definitely the highlights of the Magic Castle. They constantly switch the magic performances, so the magicians are bringing new elements of surprise to the table. If possible, definitely attend the Magic Castle if Hannibal is performing. His magic performances blew me away and he really understood how to interact with the audiences. If Hannibal is not performing, don't worry, the other magicians are also unique and entertaining. The Magic Castle invites magicians from all over the world, so you'll definitely see shows that will amaze you. Environment: I felt like I was in Hogwarts. Once you enter the building, there's no clear direction where you should go. You're free to explore the different floors, rooms, and hallways in the building. Throughout the night, you'll run into different magicians in different locations: the bars, lounges, and stages. It is pretty crowded and packed, which makes it difficult to freely roam around. Drinks: I have only tried the Magical Moment and Holy Soju. But, I personally enjoyed the Magical Moment more. The Holy Soju tasted pretty diluted and non-alcoholic. If you want that strong flavor, definitely get the Magical Moment.",5 star rating
180,1/18/2019,"This was my fourth visit and by far this was the best food and service I've experienced there. I brought twelve people from my office to enjoy the magic of the magic Castle and they were not disappointed.  From the hostesses and hosts to the bartenders when you first enter(nice pour), to our server, to the food, to the magic shows they all were excellent!!",5 star rating

182,1/9/2017,"I've come here under a few different circumstances: as a guest of the Magic Castle hotel, by and invitation from a magician and by and invitation from someone who has a membership. As a guest of a magician, we had to make dinner/brunch reservations but as a guest of a member that was able to come to the castle with us we didn't have to pay for any meals (just enjoyed drinks instead). If you are 21+ I highly recommend NOT coming for brunch. This is the only time that kids can enjoy the castle and I was, frankly, really annoyed that all the children had the first few rows for every show reserved just for them. Now, the first time I came here, I was 14 so I do appreciate that this castle even offers some family time...but, it's just not for me at this point in my life. If you have a cute little family, then take this as my advice to absolutely bring your kiddos to the castle! While the little ones weren't for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the all you can eat brunch...which is substantially cheaper than dinner. Dinner is not bad, but not amazing....and it's pretty overpriced. There's a lot to explore in the castle, each level has something to do and some sort of trinket that you can play with (e.g. fun mirrors and a haunted phone booth). The huge downside to this establishment is the LACK of female magicians. I think there might be a female magician night, but I think it's pretty sad that they are not featured on a weekly basis...especially since I have been less than impressed with a couple of magicians. Overall, I'd recommend visiting this place at least once...it is an LA staple after all.",4 star rating
183,10/2/2019,"Way overhyped. Terrible service. You're forced to pay for an entrée even if you're not that hungry for dinner, and the food isn't that great. I paid $47 for a mediocre pasta and didn't finish it because it wasn't that good and again, I wasn't that hungry but was told I wasn't allowed to get just a salad. They give you a ticket to pick your leftovers up after the magic show when you're leaving, but when leaving, I went to pick up my leftovers with my ticket, and they didn't have it for me. Also, the magic shows weren't all that great either which is mainly what I went for. Overall, it's an incredibly overhyped and overpriced experience.",1 star rating
184,9/23/2019,"My wife and I recently went to the Magic Castle with some friends, after waiting a long time for an invitation. The experience was pretty awesome! We started off by doing dinner, which was nice and tasty (although a little expensive but that's expected). After dinner we went to several different shows, all of which were amazing! The atmosphere is pretty cool, you almost feel like you're in a Harry Potter film of sorts. There are all these different hallways leading up to rooms where different magicians are performing shows. If you have a chance to check this out I would highly recommend it! We will definitely go back if given the opportunity!",5 star rating
185,10/15/2019,"Worst experience I've had in a long time. Over priced & underwhelmed from start to finish. The magic was okay. But the service was awful, the food was dreadful & our server genuinely gave off the impression that he hates his life! Tried to joke the entire time (not funny in the slightest, worse yet he was Rolling his eyes at the simplest of questions we had some serious allergies and dietary restrictions) Ps they don't accommodate vegans very well at all you'll maybe have 2 options period and as our sever put it ""we're a steak house""  great.... So $40 for some noodles and a couple tossed veggies it is!   The attitude and lack of service, topped with outrageous pricing for bland meals was enough to never make us want to return or recommend this out dated establishment. Feel bad for the magicians as they're only 20% of the experience, the other 80% was horrible.",1 star rating
186,9/7/2019,"I give this place 4 stars for the decor and the performers. They are really great at their craft so passionate. I had a great time and many laughs. Food skip it, you will be disappointed and left starving. Eat before you come. First off you can't visit without an invitation from a magician or member. If you search online they can get you in touch with someone to receive an invitation. Give yourself plenty of time to find it. We did get a little lost and traffic is legit horrendous in that area. They do valet so at least parking is not an issue. Cocktail attire is the dress code. They do have photo ops in front which is great for memories. If you don't dine in a minimum of $50 you will need to pay 35 per person. I wanted the whole experience so we decided to dine as well. Big mistake the food was overpriced, cold and no flavor. I was so disappointed. We always share plates to try different items. The beef Wellington was coming apart, the Tagliatelle pasta had very little flavor like watered down tomato, seafood and little cheese. The bbq short rib was semi decent the sauce saved it from being completely inedible. We got take out after since we were starving. Eat first and just pay the entrance fee. Drinks were very delicious tho. Shout out to the bartenders. Overall- great night of shows and drinks. A great idea for a date night. In the evening though it's 21 and over.",4 star rating

188,1/9/2018,"Went here for the second time ever together with my wife and two cousins (all three of them going for the first time) and absolutely loved it! I came here for the first time back in high school and coming back was pretty much like going for the first time ever! So we came on a Saturday night and the price of admission jumps up on Fri-Sun ($35) as opposed to Mon-Thurs ($25). Valet is a fixed price of $15 per vehicle. We arrived and entered the lobby where we paid for both valet and admission. We arrived around 8ish, and our dinner reservation was at 9:45 PM. If you schedule a dinner reservation, you can arrive anytime after 5 PM and watch magic while waiting. The restaurant also lets you check in for dinner a little earlier if you wish. First off, we went to the Hat & Hare downstairs an we're floored by the magicians down there, especially Mike the bartender (2x Close Up Magician of the Year). We then went to see some other magic shows and then had dinner. If you want the biggest bang for your buck, I would highly recommend the steak (which my cousin had). I enjoyed the risotto, which I thought was okay. We then went to the Palace of Mysteries for the main stage show (your dinner buys you entrance) and enjoyed the first part of the show, but wasn't really that impressed by the rest of it. We then went to the Parlor of Prestidigitation and enjoyed an excellent performance by Nick Paul to end the evening! As a magic fan and hobbyist magician myself, I enjoyed all the shows, and some more than others (the magician for the main stage act being the main hiccup). I give this place 4.5/5 Stars because for excellent close up magic (I'm a little biased towards close up magic), some delicious food, the novelty of the establishment, and the variety of shows. I would take of 1/2 a star because some parts of the Magic Castle TBH seems a little unkept, like someone could do some dusting (my wife noticed the same). I also understand that no pics or videos are allowed during shows, but I don't understand why pics wouldn't be allowed in other areas. (Just saying) Overall, if you're a fan of magic, you'd be missing out by not going to the Magic Castle! Go check it out and you'll see what I mean!",4 star rating
189,4/8/2018,"Like many others, was finally able to get in from a friend of a friend. It was fantastic! Met all of my expectations for the show and they are currently celebrating 55 years. The lighting inside the castle is very dim, makes the whole event mysterious. I had the pleasure of seeing a couple magicians and the main act which was great! This is definitely a place I would return to for the show. The look of the carpet makes me wonder how bad it probably smells, is that strange? The dinner, nothing to go crazy about, I was expecting a lot more, My steak (filet mignon) was not cooked as ordered and due to the setting I didn't want to send it back. The calamari was my favorite, perfectly cooked and seasoned. Served with two delicious dipping sauces. The macaroni and cheese was ok, needed more flavor, the cheese was nothing to boast about. And the worst part, couldn't take pictures of any of the food so I can't share with you all. I had a cocktail, it had the word magic in the name, can't quite remember. You are pretty crammed up in a dining area upstairs, not into it. Anyways, I would definitely come back and see more of the magicians. I would definitely be more mindful of the choices of food. I do recommend this place and if you have the chance to check it out, go for it.",4 star rating
190,11/14/2019,"We had a great time. The filet mignon was excellent. The calamari and duck tagliatelle were not good. Drinks are well priced. The ambiance is sort of cheesy but the restaurant itself was nice. We all appreciated that the hype didn't end up being true and panning out to be pretentious like we thought it would be. It's low key, lots of older folks, good magic and a good time. If you're looking for some glam, mysteriously sexy speakeasy type thing-- go somewhere else.",4 star rating
191,11/18/2017,"The Magic was incredible. Nothing like seeing a live Dove-trick in person.  A work of art. The paid show was really fun but my favorite was the slight of hand tricks (coins/cards) at one of the random side tables.  That guy was really good, too bad he didn't give me his card I would have given him 5 stars!The magic, ended with the magic. The service and food was average.  We sat down to dinner and didn't have any place setting.  The rolls came out without any butter.  The food was expensive 40-50$ per entree and tasted on the order of 10-15$:I got the garden risotto 37$ - very small portion size, quiet buttery.  Was still hungry after i devoured this average dish. My friends all got some form of steak/sirloin. The steak was incredibly dry and salty.  We don't mind paying for good food but if you're going to make average food then charge an average rate. Why eat you ask? If you don't, you'll pay 90$ for your ticket instead of 30$. The bartenders were great, the drinks were delicious.  The Appetizers were also delicious.  If i had known i would have just gotten a salad or appetizers for dinner.Now, what troubled me the most was the fact that they confiscated my leather jacket at the door and refuse to give it to me.  In the proverbial sense, I was  freezing-my-ass-off.  I asked one of the hostess if a blanket was available and her reply was ""ya, no"" and quickly ignored me.  They had shawls at the front desk but you had to give up your driver's license to get one, and even then you weren't guaranteed one because they ran out.  For such a prestigious and sought after place you would expect the equivalent of their service. And with all the restrictions and rules I simply felt trapped. Had to stay and watch the show because we paid, even though myself and the numerous random girls next to me were all simultaneously freezing.  *goosebumps.",3 star rating
192,8/26/2018,"I'm giving this place 4 stars cause it's the Magic Castle, duh. :)Anyways, this place gets expensive real fast ($$$). You have to pay valet so carpool! There is an entrance fee per person. Luckily, we had that waived. :)Other than experiencing the shows and figuring out secrets here and there, there's nothing to do here except eat, (which they require *coughforcecough* you to do with them) and drink. The meal was great by the way.These waitresses are always pushing the drinks. The moment your hand is empty they appear as if by, well, magic. If you don't want to burn through your drinking money fast, babysit your drink. They don't allow photos, but all these bimbo-types were pushing it (getting away with it) by taking photos and videos. Having a nice rack helps too.Arrive early and you'll have plenty of time to explore the castle. The piano sucks. I asked it to play me a classical piece (Rachmaninoff, Liebesleid) and it froze like a 4th grader at a talent show. Later on in the night, some annoying lady asked it to play ""Piano Man"" and whaddaya know!? The freaking hunk of junk works all of a sudden. The dress code is a great idea. You want to look good. Dress like a gentleman. And if you're a lady keep it classy.Once the place starts getting packed, the lines for the shows will start. You better get in line or you'll lose your spot.They're big on card tricks, sleight of hand, and hot air. A bunch of it. Cool experience. Gotta love L.A.!",4 star rating
193,1/6/2020,"I recently went to the Magic Castle for the first time and was utterly blown away. What a Hollywood gem - truly unlike anything else I've ever experienced in this town (or anywhere else for that matter). In the face of so much that's inauthentic in LA, this place is the real deal - equal parts weird, fascinating and, well, magic.You wander around this fabulous old Hollywood mansion to discover masterful magicians in every nook and cranny. But for me, the night was topped off by a show with a magician named Jeff Kaylor who totally blew me away (along with a room full of slack-jawed magic buffs). Jeff's 20 minute set was easily the most impressive thing I've seen all year. This guy is so ridiculous that half way through his show, I had to entertain the possibility that he wasn't performing tricks, but that he might actually be magic. As in magic, magic. I'm not easily won over, but I couldn't think of any other way that he could be pulling off the tricks he was. If you get a chance, head to the Magic Castle while he's on there - I promise you won't be disappointed.",5 star rating

You have to be a member or know a member. We were lucky enough to know a person who knew a person LOL (6 degrees of separation lol) and we made it a triple date! Read and adhere to the dress code!

The smallest room fits 22 so be prompt!)Ask a castle knight for a brief history and a tour! He can even drop you off at a show at the end. Don't forgot to visit Irma, the castle ghost at the piano behind the first bar. Her ghosty tunes are strangely up to date for being dead for long lolEntering:Valet $13, guest entry $30 per person.They check your ID (21+ for dinner) before entering the doors and you pay at the desk when you're inside in the lobby.

Magic happens.Inside:On the left when entering is the close-up room (holds 22 people) and is about a 20 min show! Ask to be an assistant. Or try to sit in the front row.

First thing you do, go ask if there are any cancellations. Keep checking back and you might get lucky!!! Our reservation was at 9:45 originally but with patience and persistence, we get ours to 8:00!!! We were so hungry lol.Dinner:Free bread and butter.We ordered the prime rib and beef wellington. You can view the menu online before attending. I also got a free dessert for my birthday (red velvet cake) and I purchased a pistachio creme brûlée! The beef Wellington was smaller than I thought. It only came with one medallion. Also had some veggies (carrots and broccoli) and mashed potatoes. The steak was very tender but the crust could have been flakier and thicker. $39 price tag.The prime rib was standard, comes in 10oz and 14oz Came with mashed potatoes, veggies and au jus. We got the 14 oz with a price tag of $48.They charge gratuity for parties of 6 or more. Cards tricks, rings, ropes, coins, mentalists! Sights to see, people to meet, food and drinks!

198,9/4/2019,"Magic Crapple is more like it. I live close to this smelly tourist trap and for a while was intrigued by it's mysterious facade. I'd heard that it was a 'must do' LA thing and I generally love old fashioned charm and class from a bygone era. This dump is has no charm or class and is one giant rip.We were a group of 6 with dinner reservations. Valet staff was professional and welcoming, like any basic valet, and the facade looks clean and well maintained. But once you're inside you realize what you were suckered into. The young doorman was completely unprofessional after asking for clarification on the photo taking policy. I knew they had a reputation for strict rules on dress code and photo taking so I wanted to make sure I played by the rules so that we would have a good time. This goofy door jerk in a bad Ross clearance rack suit talked to me like a child and told me I would be ejected if I didn't follow the photo taking policy. Hon, that's why I'm bothering to ask you so that I'm clear on the policy. It was a terrible way to welcome guests and way off brand for their supposed classy and nostalgic atmosphere. Any proper dinner or social club staff treats members and guests as if they are welcome, since you know, our dining there keeps your doors open. I am super polite and treat anyone in a server or hospitality position with absolute respect and friendliness, because my mom worked in hospitality for many years and I know how badly people can treat workers in such an environment. So his attitude was completely unwarranted and a terrible way to start off the night.This was just the first in a series of missteps and blunders on the part of their staff, who acted like we were lucky and privileged to even be allowed in. With everything that LA has to offer in terms of nightlife and entertainment, you would think they would wise up before some developer comes in and bulldozes this tacky place into oblivion.Dinner was mediocre at best and if you are expecting quality cuisine or anything worth the value of a $40 dinner plate, you will be disappointed. Bring Tums or Pepto, fyi. LA has an amazing restaurant scene with revered and famous chefs. I don't know who is running the kitchen at this gussied up Denny's but it just doesn't work.The best aspect of the whole charade is the main attraction magic shows, if you can manage to get into one. The smaller shows were okay. I've seen amazing magic and illusionist shows in Vegas, London and on Broadway, and everything at Magic Crapple was sub par in comparison.Go to Disneyland, ride the Haunted Mansion, eat some crappy amusement park food and you will have the same experience, except for the rude attitude and stinky carpet.",1 star rating
199,4/15/2018,"This place was absolutely magical! It was beyond my expectations with the talent, ambiance, and organization of the entire evening. We ate dinner in the Houdini room and if you go with a group I would highly recommend eating in this room. The food was great but the entertainment and history of the entire castle is what makes this place amazing.I can't explain it but you can definitely feel the old time vibe and it's incredible to think of all people who have walking and performed in those rooms.I would recommend valeting you car and make sure to dress up!",5 star rating
200,3/31/2017,"I feel so lucky and fortunate to have gotten access to the Magic Castle! In past years I've seen pictures of people posing in front of the Magic Castle backdrop and didn't realize, until I did some research, how difficult and exclusive it is to get in. I had originally thought the Magic Castle as some museum where you could easily enter by paying an admission fee. Never would I have thought that I would be able to get into this place. It's not everyday that you meet someone who happens to be a magician, that is such a rarity! Luckily enough for me a mutual friend of mine just so happened to be a magician in training who is a member and offered to take me. Talk about excited!Walking inside felt like I was getting thrown into the prohibition era. It had a very speakeasy feel and much of the decor reminded me of being at Disneyland (either inside the Tower or Terror or the Haunted Mansion) or in a scene from Harry Potter! It was great. Although I didn't get to dine in except at the bar, the food smelled and looked great - steak, veggies, mashed potatoes, etc. But even so, the bar food was just as good. I ordered the Owl Bar burger and it was moist and tasty. It was also a big enough order to doggy bag to go- too much food.What also made this place remind me so much of Disneyland was that it also had various shows going on simultaneously and with multiple show times that continued through out the night. I am easily awestruck by magic and wouldn't mind watching it for hours. Too much fun! Make sure to catch the show in the Palace of Mystery!Tip: don't forget to get the freehand silhouette as a souvenir ($15).",4 star rating
201,8/5/2019,"The Magic Castle is one of those places everyone wants to try. There is something about the perceived exclusivity of it. True, you have to be accompanied or invited by a member, but getting an invite isn't very difficult. I've been lucky enough to attend twice, once for dinner and once for brunch having been given an invitation from two difference members. If you don't know a member don't worry, I've known people who search and message random magicians on Instagram asking for an invite (which is good for up to 6 people)...PRESTO! it works. Members, give out invitations freely and eagerly, even to random strangers.There will always be an entrance fee. Check the website for updated prices, but they are between $25-$35 a person.  The entrance fee does just that, allows you to enter. Once inside you can visit one of the multiple bars for snacks and drinks and watch multiple magic shows held in a couple of different rooms right off or below the main bar. If you go with an invite from a member you are required to have a meal at the second floor restaurant. You will be charged $70 a person if you enter and skip your meal reservation to just eat at one of the several bars, which serve food as well. Also, if you don't eat at the restaurant you won't get tickets to the one Grand Palace show in the castle. The ticket for this show is ""free"" as long as you eat a meal at the second floor restaurant.The problem with the restaurant is that the food is really expensive and not very good. I think a lot of people are willing to pay as long as there is quality, but I haven't experienced that here. If you do come, I recommend coming for brunch. It's not that the quality is any better, but there is a decent variety including crab legs, omelet station, carving station, and more. I got the most enjoyment out of the kids stations which had tater tots, waffles, and an ice cream bar. I'm not sure if bottomless champagne/mimosas was included in the $39.99 brunch price or if we paid extra for it, but it is worth getting. Just like their restaurant, the drinks at the bars are expensive and not the best. Load up on champagne at brunch and fill up your glass one last time as you are allowed to bring it with you into any of the magic shows.",3 star rating
202,9/2/2018,"A sexist institution that you should simply avoid. Here's why.My girlfriend and I show up at ""the castle"" dressed to the nines to accommodate their dress code. We appreciate a dress code at a club. It facilitates a certain kind of atmosphere -- classy, upscale, we're down to play our part. Except, my girl is wearing a romper. A stunning romper, mind you; she looks like a cross between a 1940s movie star and an angel, the exact sort of tasteful glamour that an aging, hokey business like this could only hope to attract inside. But they don't let her inside. Because rompers are the same thing as ""shorts"", and that doesn't meet the dresscode. However, instead of having us leave immediately, they offer a long black sack for my girlfriend to wear over her romper, held up by a safety pin. This, they say, meets the dress code. Let's pause to consider the effect of this.Instead of having a gorgeous bombshell of a woman adding youth, sophistication and modern relevance to the premises, they've elected to make a beautiful young woman feel embarrassed and underclass by dressing her like a matronly old sack held together with pins. THIS is the ""vibe"" they'd prefer? My girlfriend tried so hard to overcome the humiliation, standing there in a trash bag as other guests stared at her, wondering what on earth was going on. She didn't want to ruin the night for me or our other friends. But I could see the tears of the embarrassment welling up in her eyes. So I asked her to get out of the sack and go get the car that we'd just dropped off with the valet. She did. And I turned to the woman at the counter. The woman was vaguely sympathetic, having seen all of this before. I expressed how terrible and counterproductive the nuts and bolts of this ""dress code"" were. How they had completely ruined many people's nights, created lifelong enemies of the establishment and lessened the very image and clientele that the code aspired to foster. Her response is what drove the final nail into this sad old coffin:The woman replied, ""Honestly, everyone here complete agrees with you; but the board of directors of the Magic Castle are all old white men from the 1960s, and we don't have a choice but to enforce their rules. I'm so sorry.""Not so magical, huh? Look, here's the thing. When you buy an overpriced drink or a gross theme-park caliber meal at a business like this, you're casting a vote. You're voting for the antiquated, offensively sexist, old white man agenda that should simply no longer exist in our society. This place is an old Hollywood institution. But you know what? That's not a good enough reason to go. The truth is this. The venue has the dusty old appeal of the Haunted Mansion at Disney World -- kitschy, beaten up, cute but by no means truly classy. The true class comes only from the superb magicians lending their talents, and us...the suckers who come in and pretend that there's any true elegance to the place. As for seeing those superb magicians, fear not -- they have other great venues to perform around Los Angeles. I encourage you to find them, and to not do business with this not-so-magical faded icon. Some recommendations: Magicopolis, the Magic Bar, Black Rabbit Rose, or Comedy & Magic Club.",1 star rating

I have heard of other people having magic experiences during their actual dinner like waiter doing tricks or their table elevating, we only had mediocre food and a weird waiter lol.The shows were very impressive. Neither me or my husband considered ourselves huge magic fans before but this was super awesome. Not only is the magic very cool but the magicians had us laughing a lot too. Our reservations were at 945 and I wish we knew In Advance to come earlier because we only caught two shows in total (there was nothing after that)Also you should know their entrance fee is in addition to dinner.

206,2/2/2018,"I have been wanting to come to The Magic Castle for years because it is legendary among Angelenos. My family actually has reciprocal rights at the club and we have a dear friend who is a member, but it took a totally independent party getting an invitation and asking me to join her to get me ""over the hump.""As an avid Yelper, I was devastated by the no photo rule, but I appreciate the proprietary nature of the craft and the elegant nature of the Club.  I encourage all Yelpers to do the same - let's have a reputation of respecting the rules.But, I digress...the enchanting Victorian House captivates from the moment you say the magic words and have the mystery door open to the dark rooms within. The decor is dark, elegant and luxurious. The staff is professional, friendly and attentive. The entertainment is...worth it!Valet parking is a must, even at the exorbitant $15 price tag. Guests will also be paying a $25 cover unless they are active duty military. Still, I never felt robbed.  For about $100, I had a delicious dinner and an amazing evening of entertainment.We started in the Owl Bar. I was the DD, but my companion had the aged Old Fashioned made with Wild Turkey Rye infused with whiskey aged cherries, a bit of orange and Angostura bitters. It is a very oaky preparation of this drink - very clever but one sip was enough.  I preferred the sip that I had of another companion's ""In & Of Itself"" made from crazy smooth Kikori Japanese Whiskey, Benedictine, Angustora Bitters, and a bit of ginger ale (the bar by the main stage puts too much ginger ale, FYI). The whiskey was so smooth it was bourbon like and it was a perfectly balanced drink.We had dinner as well.  I ordered the Vegan Special which was AHMAZING.  Sliced, grilled Portobello Mushrooms cooked in a Marsala tomato sauce with red roasted peppers were served with two square roasted garlic Polenta cakes atop a bed of sauteed spinach.  It was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. I also succumbed to the call of the warm Pretzel rolls and had a few bites with some of the whipped butter.  Everyone - filet to vegan, Brussels Sprouts to Crab Mac and Cheese - was very happy with their dish.Afterwards, we walked around to see ""Irene"" at the piano (she played a little Journey for us). Then, we headed to the stage for the main show. Zabrecky, Tina Lenert and Ardan James put together a hilarious show. I particularly loved Zabrecky's dark and dry humor. He was even funnier than he was tricky - and he was pretty tricky.The show was about an hour, and we left with huge grins left over from the roaring laughter.  We went down to see the Hat and Hare Bar, which was closed up for the evening, but we did get to see a couple of great magicians performing magic tricks.Despite having been up since before 5AM, I was still having a great time at 11:15. But, I knew there was a long journey home.  I highly recommend coming early, getting a drink and seeing a few shows and then going to dinner and going to the main show.  Fill the evening with fun - The Magic Castle is worth it!",5 star rating
207,10/16/2017,"Finally!  I made it in!  It isn't everyday that you get to go to one of LA's most exclusive invite only clubs. We were lucky enough to have a magician friend who was able to walk us in without having dinner reservations and having to pay the cover charge.  We had drinks and appetizers which was perfect as we spent most of the night drinking, snacking, and moseying from room to room.  The rooms are intimate and small and really allows the audience to get up close and personal to see magicians work their art. Half the time I was in awe and thinking, ""how'd he do that?!"" and ""where did that go?!""There's magic in every corner of the Magic Castle so you will never run out of things to do/see.  Decor inside is beautiful, classy, and elegant. It's dark and mysterious with flickering oil lamps chandeliers, and secret doors.  I felt like it took me right back to Houdini's time during the 1920s. They are strict about the no photos inside rule so don't even think about being sneaky.  Dress code is also strictly enforced so make sure you gussy up and look real nice.  It was a really fun and unique experience, I can only hope I get another invite to come back!",5 star rating
208,12/16/2017,"Quick tips: - valet only (bring cash for the tip)- invite only - there is a dress code, inquire before coming- don't bring a camera or take pictures inside (not allowed, you will be kicked out) - let them know if it's your birthday, they will give you a birthday pin so the magicians know when it's your special day- night show is 21 & over, brunch kids are allowed- if you can go during the holidays its fun and festive, they put up Halloween and Christmas decorations There's tons of reviews of this place and YES we already know that it is a nice a fun place to go to have a good meal and see some great magicians. I'm not an expert of this place but I have been here twice. Once for their brunch and once for their dinner so I'll just comment on the differences of both. First I do want to note (if you haven't already known), the Magic Castle is invite only. You have to be a member or know someone who has connections. I heard you can apply for a membership but it's a Long and expensive process. Once there there's an entrance free. Also, it's valet only. And there is a strict dress code so make sure you coordinate with who invited you to see the rules.Anyway for brunch you get more of a buffet style meal. Make sure to get your food when the line is short cause it does pile up in there. Unlimited mimosas is included with your meal. Also, the brunch is for kids as well. With dinner, you get more of an upscale type dinner. It's a one person per entree minimum and if you don't get anything you'll be charged $50 to sit (so might as well get something). Food is probably a 3.7/5 I would say. Not the best for its value but hey, you're there mainly for the shows and experience. The dinner show is 21 and over and I would have to say way better than the brunch. The magicians are unsensored and more loose (maybe cause they have more alky in them who knows). The audience is also more enthusiastic and energetic. Also, when we went for the day show, we had kids (they always let them sit in the front) that kept interrupting the magician so it delayed the show a little. If you ever get the chance to get invited definitely try and go. It's a wonderful experience!",5 star rating
209,12/15/2015,"I was excited to finally be have the opportunity to visit the Magic Castle. Since it's a members-only club I had been at my wits' end trying to find a way to get a guest invite. The recent visit far exceeded my expectations. Before my visit I had envisioned outdated interiors with some retired magicians performing mediocre magic tricks in a small dining room. I couldn't have been more wrong.When you first arrive you'll make your way up the long driveway and pull up to the $12 valet. You then enter the front door and check in at the front desk. There will be a flyer there with the list of performers and show times. This lobby is also the only place where you can take pictures since photos are not permitted inside the clubhouse. After announcing, ""open sesame,"" a magical bookshelf opens up allows you to walk into the lounge/bar area where you can mingle as you wait for your dinner table reservation.When it comes time for dinner you will make your way up a long spiral staircase and wait to be seated. Each person is required to order an individual entrée meal. The average price for an entrée is about $40. After your meal you can head over to one of the various theaters and watch one of the scheduled magic shows. The first one that you'll probably want to watch is the one held in The Palace of Mystery which is the largest theater. It is also the longest running show. We watched Jonathan Pendragon. He gave a wonderful performance which featured an ensemble cast that happened to include his daughter. It featured classic magic tricks along with storytelling, humor, and live singing performances.After the show you're free to explore other parts of the historic clubhouse, view other smaller performances, such as the Parlour of Prestidigitation or The Peller Theater, or just hang out and have some drinks at the bar.Overall we had a really great time. It's was a really classy and unique experience that was both authentically cool from both a visual and historical standpoint. The only downside is that the entire night can be a little pricey. After paying for the valet, door charge, dinner and drinks, you can expect to spend over $100 per person. It's also worth mentioning that there is a strict dress code. Men will need to wear a coat, tie and slacks.  Best of all, during our meal a photographer came around and offered to take our picture in the Houdini Room for $20. The purchase included a guest pass that lets you bring up to 5 guests for a return visit. I plan to bring my kids to one of their Saturday and Sunday Parlour Kids' Show brunch performances.",5 star rating
210,9/22/2017,"I was fortunate enough to visit the Magic Castle because a friend had extra guest tickets. It was an awesome experience. The magicians who I saw perform were fabulous with the exception of the main performance. I would definitely give this place 5 stars for the magic, but I'm deducting 1 for terrible food and a bizarre main act. We got here before 7p.m. and I was lucky enough to squeeze into a pre-dinner performance in one of the smaller theaters. Even though my group didn't get to sit together, I had no problem sitting alone. The magician was hilarious and had some great tricks incorporating the iPhone and Siri. Great first show.Obviously no one comes here for the food, but if we have to buy food, it should at least be palatable. We sat for dinner for our 8p.m. reservation and I ordered the 12 oz. prime rib. I think this was probably one of the better options on the menu. The salmon also looked decent. Apart from the prime rib being cold, the mashed potatoes were lackluster and I got 2 little carrots and a little piece of broccoli for the vegetables. The menu is way overpriced. Some entrances require that you to pay for an entree at dinner, which was our case, and the cheapest entree is $31... for garden risotto. I tasted my friend's beef wellington. It was terrible. We also ordered the molten lava cake, which was probably bigger than anyone's meal and one of the highlights among the food, but it didn't even come with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.After dinner we rushed over to get into the main auditorium. The performance was honestly bizarre. There was sword swallowing by one performer and another performer hammered a nail into his nose. It was very... Ripley's Believe It or Not. The rest of the act was very cheesy and theatrical. We weren't the only ones who thought the show was one of the strangest things we have ever seen. Honestly, I would come again because the close up magicians, were absolutely fabulous. Jack and Sigfried astounded us with their magic tricks. I'm assuming the main act is normally quite impressive. I think we were just unlucky this night.",4 star rating

215,8/4/2016,"I normally come here for the show in the main theater, but usually end up coming for dinner.  Dinner on average (main course and a couple of cocktails/wine) will run you about $40-$60.  Considering that you also get to enjoy an evening of magic performances from some world-class artists really isn't that bad of a deal in Hollywood.  Always ordered the prime rib for $40 and has never been a wrong choice.  The 10 oz portion is the perfect size and service has been excellent there.  Cocktails run about $9 for house and $11 for call.  It's always a treat to catch a good act there, and this time it was Scott Land, the master puppeteer who was behind the movie Team America: World Police.  If you haven't seen his work, look it up on Youtube!Valet parking is $3 for members, and $13 for non-members.  Dress to impress when you come here, otherwise you might not get in!",5 star rating
216,2/19/2019,"This rating is going to mainly be focused on their restaurant. My friends and I recently were invited to the Magic Castle. From my perspective, I thought it was mandatory to dine in but I was wrong. I saw that there were different lines for the magic shows. I came to the Magic Castle knowing that the food wasn't going to be that great (several of my friends came recently as well and were not impressed with the food). I didn't think that it would be bad since they are a well known place but everyone was right. Every one at the table had to order an entree. All the entrees were priced ~$30 and up. I believe the cheapest entree that you can purchase was a salad which was ~$30. My friends and I ordered the Tomahawk Steak with a lobster tail, Prime rib, Salmon, and Chilean Sea bass. The prime rib and the tomahawk steak both came out cold and lacked flavor. The steaks weren't even warm, it seemed as if the steaks/prime rib have been sitting out for a while before they served it to their customers. The lobster tail was also not hot but surprisingly was pretty good. I would say the lobster tail was probably the best dish that I had that night. My two friends who ordered the fish said that they liked the dish as well but their fish was also not warm. Overall, I would say that I wouldn't come back for their food. I gave them a 3-star because the waiter was actually very friendly and was able to answer all of our questions about the restaurant and the different shows. If you're coming to the magic castle, I would definitely recommend skip the meal and go straight for the shows! Save the money and go to a nicer restaurant before going for the shows. There are entrance fees at the Magic Castle but I'm not sure if it is more expensive if you don't purchase dinner. I would advise to call the reservations to double check!",3 star rating
217,9/18/2017,"My husband and I enjoyed an amazing anniversary date here at the Magic Castle (proclaimed as the most unusual private club in the world) for an evening of magic and dinner and was in for a treat! There were strings of magic shows in little nooks, hideaways, tables, and even the bartenders put on their own shows. There are so many shows to see! Dinner was delicious with lobster cakes, Beef Wellington and rack of lamb (save room for the banana cream pie). Some magicians more more serious and some were downright hilarious. I really enjoyed Joe Velvet's show and Brian Ochab in the late night close-up gallery. The Palace of Mystery was great with Tom, David, & Dale. I love the Victorian decor! Many times I ALMOST broke the rule-no photos inside the castle.

No pictures allowed in the castle until you get kicked out.. The magic is mind blowing. Some magicians are so flawless that I saw no strings when they made things move and transfer. There's only like one or two magicians that were okay, but I was not disappointed. Good for birthdays and group celebrations.The food was really good! Superb Tomahawk steak!!Scrumptious Mac and cheese side order. Their clam chowder could have been better but I tasted a lot of seafood and clam so thats a good thing. The soup could have been more thick.I also had their sea bass and it was so flavorful and tasty. The portion of the sea bass is surprisingly enough to get you full as it came with chopped asparagus and mushrooms. I heard you see celebrities here occasionally-I was lucky to see Pee Wee Herman last night, but of course no pictures allowed.

219,10/9/2018,"I recently got the privilege of going to the Magic Castle. If you grew up driving by the place you know how awe-inspiring the castle can be. Then you find out that you have to be a member and the thought of picking up magic enters your mind. For those of us who do not follow up on the idea, thankfully there are people who did and are members that let us use their tickets. While the cover charge of $35 might seem a bit steep, the experience is definitely worth it. The interior is incredibly well designed. There are five bars hidden throughout the building and hopefully you can grab a drink at each. I did enjoy the magic shows but it may not be for everyone. They aren't as advanced as what you would expect/want to see, but if you want to be tricked and fooled, you will have a good time. OR you can sit there and break apart the trick with your friends/group. I did enjoy the food upstairs. I got a tomahawk steak and it was magical. The price certainly was pretty good. I think it is due to the cover charge and how much they make off of drinks, but the steak was $20-$30 less than at other steakhouses but was just as good. Considering how hard it is to get tickets, if you do manage to snag a pair, definitely try this place out. I know there are many people who come here as their go-to bar or steak house. Frankly it is the best themed bar in LA. I recommend you grab a pack or two of playing cards at the front door. Even though they are like $12 a pack, they look fantastic and I regret not snagging a pair.",5 star rating

224,7/20/2017,"AbraCadabra!  Get your magic fix on at L.A.'s venerable Magic Castle!  It is a private club for magician members and those who can afford to be a patron of the ancient art of Magic.  Although private, it's not too difficult to wrangle a pass from magicians performing in L.A., through asking friends and even a few Yelpers who are members.  As for me, I have to rely on friends of friends.There are different passes:  the first decision is whether you want to go for the evening or for weekend brunch.  I will warn you that the weekend brunch shows tend to be more youngster-centric since that's the ONLY time kids are allowed.  The evenings are adults only with a quite strict dress code and can be crowded, especially on Saturday nights.  Please read the rules and dress code restrictions carefully - they do not joke around!  The most important rule of all is NO PHOTOGRAPHY once past the lobby.  I know, unnatural for Yelpers...Admission fees vary from $20 pp Monday - Thursdays and $30 pp Friday, Saturday or Sunday evenings.  Valet parking is $13 and your admission and valet together can be charged to your credit card at the door.The decor is dark Victorian as befitting a mansion built in 1909.  As you enter from the lobby, you will be in front of a bookcase looking at an owl and you will loudly proclaim, ""Open Sesame!""  The bookcase will magically open up to the main room and bar.  Restrooms are to your right, next to the staircase.  The bar is directly in front of you.  Behind the bar is the ""Invisible Irma"" room which stars a piano playing ghost.Here are my Pro Tips:*Plan ahead, make DINNER reservations MONTHS ahead of time.  It's now July and I just booked my next res for NOVEMBER.  Yes, that's how fast those dinner res get booked up.  For my July visit, we booked in early March.  Book a 6pm dinner...*Make sure ALL of your party arrives by 4:45 pm.  Take photos outside.  The doors open at 5:00 pm.  Pay your entrance fee, valet fee, get a SHOW SCHEDULE and enter the main room.*Head immediately for the Close-up Gallery to your left for the first 5pm show.  You can get cocktails once you're safely in line or once seated.  This is a small room where you will see card tricks done on a table, close-up style.*Go to your 6pm dinner upstairs.  Peek into the Houdini Seance Room if possible.  Entree purchase is required for EVERY member of your party in order to get guaranteed Palace of Mystery tickets!  The least expensive entree is the large Cobb Salad, $28.  The most expensive is the Beef Wellington, $41.  Food is over-priced but excellent.  NO pictures Yelpers!*Get at least one of your Party to go down the hallway (past more restrooms) to stand in line for the Palace of Mystery show.  This is their large showroom.  You will get tickets for this with each entree ordered at dinner.  Show starts at 8pm but seats at 7:35ish.  Cocktail service available prior to the show.*After the Palace, immediately exit to the back corner door, opposite of where you entered to try to get into the 9:15 pm Parlour of Prestidigitation show.  This is their medium-sized room.  If you didn't make it, leave one of your party in line for the 10:15 pm show while the rest of you can wander around a bit.*Ladies, no sandals allowed and high heels (or dressy flats if you must) are the thing here.  But know that there's a lot of walking, stairs and some uneven stone surfaces.  Step carefully!Once you've done these three main rooms/shows, everything else is gravy...The biggest tip of all is to take someone who has been there before to show you the ropes.  You don't want to wander around and miss shows and waste time and money.  Second choice is to follow my Pro Tips...I could write a lot more, but I'm sure I've reached the Yelp Review Word Limit.  Definitely a worthwhile experience if you love or even like magic!Yelp Challenge 2017:  52/100",5 star rating
225,3/8/2018,I was so stoked to get invited to the magic castle and it did not disappoint! My jaw was literally dropped in amazement the whole time! I love love Loved the magic castle! I was a little magic hog and had to sit up front for every act! I got to help out with some card tricks and that was amazing! I definitely want to come back. The food was good and the ambience was great. You have to get dressed up but that just added to the excitement. Perfect for a night out with some friends and family or even a date!,5 star rating
226,1/27/2019,"Cattle Castle! From the moment we walked in and were accused of not having the right email confirmation for admission, to being told my girlfriend had to wear her coat all night because she was wearing a skirt that looked too much like pants, to an overpriced dinner that we were rushed through, to being herded like cattle from one room to the next, to sitting in the back row for shows we couldn't see under some kind of antiquated AC, to the utter lack of originality in the shows...such a disappointment! The place looks like they haven't updated a thing since the 60s when it opened complete with cottage cheese ceilings and bluish faded pictures of people we've never heard of.If you want a fun night of first rate magic with friends check out the Black Rabbit Rose. Way less money, way more creative, and way more fun.",1 star rating
227,9/28/2015,"The fancy Magic Castle.  Come prepared with money because it is pricey. To get in is $30 a person. You also have to be invited here, you wouldn't be able to just show up to eat. You have to have a reserved table which can take months to get. Suit and tie for guys and heals and dress for girls.We arrived late to our reserved time, but they were great about seating us right away and getting our food out quickly so we did not miss our show.Sadly no pictures were allowed inside. So as a Yelper and you yelpers, you know it was hard to hold back my camera! But I followed directions.For dinner I ordered a cranberry and vodka to drink and the beef wellington to eat. We started off with their infamous cheese bread which was very delish!  The beef wellington came out quickly after and wow was it good! The meat was so tender and the outside crusting was soft and flavorful. I very much enjoyed it and recommend it! As soon as we ate we had to quickly move to the show which was starting in 3 minutes. We made it in and the show was 45 minutes. The comedian was hilarious! He threw in some tricks he used with balls and had me laughing the whole time. The next act was a magician. This guy didn't impress me at all, sadly. I didn't find any tricks great and he wore this XL jacket for his XS body. Hmm where's all those things coming from!? There was a guy who made string puppets that looked so real. That act was also just okay. After that show we made our way to different rooms with new magicians. I found these ones way better. We were actually front row face to face with them so all tricks were hands on. Irma on the piano is also cool!I did enjoy my time here, but it's one of those places to try and probably be a one time thing.",4 star rating
228,8/22/2019,"Normally I have enjoyed my visits to the Magic Castle but during my last visit a female manager singled me out for my dress being ""too sheer"" for their ""older conservative crowd"". I had already checked in with valet, the doormen, the ladies at the desk who actually took pictures of me and complemented me on my dress. I was already in the bar and on my way to one of the galleries when she pulled me back to the front to wrap an ugly, used shawl around my elegant dress. Mind you that they do have a strict dress code but I was overdressed if anything. Was very embarrassing and felt personal. Also doubt that if I wasn't a WOC she would have said anything. Don't know how the Castle will survive if they don't cater to a younger and more diverse crowd.",1 star rating
229,9/16/2015,"To be able to enter the Magic Castle, you have to be invited or know a member or a magician of this exclusive club. I was invited a few times by a Magician friend many years ago but never took the opportunity to come.  The Magician friend has moved away from LA and I have regretted it since. All I ever got was to the top and outside of the castle to take pictures of the view. Lucky for me, my 2 Lovely and beautiful friends, Dana, and Sofia opened up their invitation to me a few weeks ago and I jumped at the opportunity when possible! The castle sits on a hill over Hollywood.  Once entered, the lobby of the castle has no visible doors to the interior, and guests must say a secret phrase to a wooden owl to gain access in. One must say ""OPEN SESAME"" to a bookcase which then slides away as a sliding secret door.  Inside is the dimmed light grand Salon with Victorian chandeliers, a lit fire place, and a huge grandfather clock on a staircase that leads to the club's restaurant and theaters and show rooms.  The interior design is stunning in a dark artistic kind of way. Being a ""Magic Castle"" the design reminds me of an old Victorian mansion in a horror movie. Lol.What to expect? A classy and entertaining night with good friends and Magicians. What to wear:  Formal and dress code is strictly enforced.  (Wear Black, black is always formal. Lol) Men must wear a tie. If you don't have a tie with you, the club will lend one for you to wear. Where to park:  Drive up the little hill and valet parking only for $13What time to arrive: If you are having dinner at the Magic Castle, Aside from the starred shows, there are many magicians performing tricks all around the castle. Give yourself some extra time so you can walk around see all the different magicians around to do some magic tricks for small crowds around him.  We arrived at almost 8pm, dinner felt a bit rushed and when we got into the show room, all the good seats were taken. There are different magicians, illusionists, mentalists and that night we saw the balloon man and the illusionist Taiwanese Mike Chao. He was awesome with his mind blowing illusion tricks!What to eat: I ordered the 21 day old aged rib eye steak. This was not on that day's menu so make sure you ask the waiter what the chef's special of the day they have. My friends had their Colorado rack of lamb, prime rib, shrimp creole, and some appetizers. Complimentary bread and butter are given at every table upon request. Although my leftover rib eye steak tastes much better the next day, keep in mind the food is good but not anything superb or memorable. $$$ dollar sign: $13 to valet park, $20 to enter the club, about $60-$80 for dinner, and additional if you have some drinks around the bars, and if you want to buy some items at the gift shop.Overall, it was an entertaining night and I recommend if you ever have an opportunity to go, take that chance because keep in mind membership fees starts at $1000+ a year and you are only allowed in by invitation only. You should at least experience it once in your  lifetime, especially if you like magic! :-)",4 star rating
230,4/16/2019,"What can I say, this place is amazing. First off, you have to know a magician who is a member to get an invitation, and that's not that easy of a feat. Once you get the reservation, dinner is very good and large portions. But also on the pricey side. I would suggest a 6 o'clock dinner seating so you can catch the close-up magic room when you get there which has the first show at 5 PM.There's multiple bars in multiple areas to see you shows, make sure you go to the piano and ask Irma to Play you a song and she will. Check out Archimedes at the owl bar halfway up the stairs.Plan on this being an entire night, and having your mind blown. The oysters Rockefeller, rack of lamb, flourless molten lava cake are all my personal favorites here.",5 star rating
231,12/31/2018,"The place is amazing inside and out. Must have Invitation and Reservations  to come here, Formal dress code enforced, Valet parking only. We arrived early to see other performers. The Magic Castle has lots of smaller rooms where you can see other performers from your main event performer. So arrive early. In total we enjoyed 9 performance in one night . Most performance at approximately 20-30 minutes long. Must have Dinner, I had the Beef Wellington with Brussels Sprouts it was deliciously delicious . Everyone in our party enjoyed why they are which was a pleasant surprise as other Comedy , Magic places don't serve good food. This place Rocked.

233,8/17/2017,My coworker had tickets to this place and he was super nice to invite my GF and I to join them one night. This place is SUPER popular so if you are thinking of coming reserve well in advance. We had dinner reservations at 915pm but came to the castle at about 8pm to explore. Everything here was amazing. All the magicians were super funny and friendly and their tricks are pretty crazy. They also have a couple of bars. Get their NPH Old Fashioned!I thought was going to be meh and overpriced because of the venue but it was pretty damn good as well. I wish I had more tickets :(.,5 star rating
234,1/26/2020,"Alright, so everyone knows the magic castle as this super exclusive, super mysterious place that you can only get in with an invite. All I gotta say is that it's not worthy. The frustration that comes with this place starts even before you get here with more than hour long holds on the phone to even place a reservation. We get here and we're charged a $25 entrance fee per person, which isn't a big deal if we weren't charged wayy more as the day progressed. We started off going to to two magic shows-- one of them was pointless (granted, it also was a kids show) and the close up show which was great (thank u to the Berkeley linguistics undergrad whose name I forgot). We quickly went up to the brunch-- THE WORST PART OF IT ALL. My group and I all ate different foods and everything was cold, soggy, and NOT worth the $200 (that we were not informed of) that they charge. We had to eat in a hurry and head to the next magic show that was supposed to be the main one and the one that you can only get a ticket to with brunch. Now, that show  was interesting but I did like the close up show the most. The staff (not the magicians) were overall unfriendly, particularly this one guy who really did not have any respect for personal space. After the way I was treated today, I honestly don't understand why anyone would become a member or even come back again. DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1 star rating
235,9/2/2015,"Coming back here with a pretty big group is pretty fun. All I can say is traffic has gotten worse so a few from our group is running late. That provided us with plenty of time to take and re-take and take some more pictures outside on the red carpet and Magic Castle background. I hope you ladies do notice that everyone was waiting patiently for their turn. Receptionists and guys at the door still let us in so we can hang out at the bar. Rum-chata with Fireball will change the way you think. You can thank me later.Once we got the entry squared away, we were off into our first magic show to watch. How do they do those tricks? We pretty much took up the entire room with 15 of us. Having come here before, I knew the layout pretty good but don't remember seeing a sort of tour guide that took us to every room to tell us the history about it. He's been there for quite a while and I was surprised I didn't see him last time I was here. He's in his 90's and remembers everything and climbs up and down these stairs. So if you're short of breath with just a flight of stairs, you have no excuse if he can truck up and down without a problem.I did hear they improved their menu items and I was really excited about what is on the menu and what we can order. I remember the beef wellington was on the menu before but I was truly disappointed. My mouth just started watering when I saw rack of lamb and also prime rib on the menu. I always like a good pasta but the waiter even asked how I want the prime rib cooked. Rare, of course. That's how it came out on the plate. I have to be the pig in the group because I don't remember anyone ordering the lobster tail in addition to their large enough meal along with the mac 'n cheese. Were you about to ask me if I had any leftovers? You probably have never seen me eat and the answer is no. With the dinner, we do get a ticket each for the main stage magic show. We don't have to wait in line and walk straight in to take a seat. We took up the entire back row and part of the row in front of that. It's like seeing one of the shows in Vegas but in every single room. I'm sure I'll remember his name but the bar outside of the main stage, there is a magician at the end of the bar always at this table amazing everyone with different tricks. I have always enjoyed watching each time at his table. I can keep telling you about each show and what tricks they did and what you should see but I think it's one of those experiences you need to see for yourself. Look at everything and try to get in to all the shows. It would be an evening you won't forget. Just make sure you silence your phones and don't take any pictures or videos.",4 star rating
236,9/2/2015,"The Magic Castle is an exclusive club for magicians and magician enthusiasts located in Hollywood. At the venue, you can dine, drink, and watch tons of magic performances. To get in, you'd need to know a magician that is part of this club or obtain a guest pass.- $30 Entrance Fee- $14 Valet Fee (can tip at the entrance)A few rules to follow:- Bring a valid photo ID- Strict dress code (men in coat and tie, women in cocktail dresses or pant suit)- No photos past the lobby- Put your phones on silent and/or don't use them!At one of the more intimate magic shows (~15 people), a phone started ringing and the owner (this lady sitting in the front row) takes out the phone and actually answers it. Straight up! The rest of us watched her in disbelief. And then the magician quickly grabbed all his stuff and rushed out of there. What a rude lady... we couldn't stop talking about how she ruined the finale of the magician's show for everyone. Dinner tips:- Reservations required (call at least a week in advance)- Seatings are 6pm, 8pm, and 9:45pm- Dinner guests will receive a reserved ticket for one of the showsI've been to The Magic Castle a couple of times, but this was the first time I dined there. Like many Yelpers said, the food is whatever. All of their entrees are $40+ and not really worth the price tag. My salmon was a little overcooked, and my friends said their steaks were just alright.The tour is fun because you get to learn about all the different rooms, renovations, and some special members of the club. But it was definitely longer than we expected, so grab a beer or a cocktail before you start! The Magic Castle has a handful of bars, and at some bars, you can even watch the bartender/magician do some tricks. Brian the Photographer is available if you wanted to get a picture of you and your homies. There are only certain areas he can snap pictures at! For $20, you get an .jpg (not a print!) emailed to you. (So if you have a big group, you can even split the cost!) Along with the .jpg, you also get a guest pass for up to 6 people. What he doesn't tell you upfront is that it's only valid Monday-Thursday, Saturday brunch, and Sunday.Personal experience: If you can get into The Magic Castle without having to pay for dinner, that would be golden. Plus, that just means two extra hours of watching magic shows instead of eating mediocre food!",4 star rating
237,8/9/2015,"Magic Magic Castle What? Magical experiences come to those who seek them, when they come it could be in many different ways or illusions of what one may classify as reality or a slight gesture of the hand to trick the naked eye. Either way magic is awesome and when you get to experience it at the Incredible level that Magic Castle puts it on at it's an amazing adventure to share with friends, family and of course fellow Yelpers.Coming here I wasn't really sure what to expect other than awesome magic but what I did find was an amazing history of the act and a really cool building of a few windy staircases leading to various places where you could catch some magic and a cold drink at the bar!The interior of the place is awesome super dark with a ton of random artifacts various bars and stage rooms. Pretty much if you come here go and try to experience all of it because what you find is really cool!The food here was delicious of these scrumptious sounding entrées I went with the pan-seared jidori chicken it had a rich sauce over it that had a hint of wine and the fresh cherry tomatoes just hit the spot the dish also came with mashed potatoes that were just insanely yummy!At one point we had this super mellow old French dude who has worked there for over 25 years join our group he was one of the tour guides for the castle he was funny and very informative about the castle and it's history unfortunately I can't remember his name but if you find him have him join your group as it brought us a really cool time!The shows were pretty mind blowing as some of the tricks they preformed on our group were pretty spectacular and left us wondering how they did it and wow that was wayyy cool!The castle is an awesome and yummy experience I would highly recommend coming here for a visit the ownly downfall would have to be the price as its very expensive for everything but I guess the experience is worth it!Who knows when I will return here but definitely again at one point as we had a blast shoutout to Annee T for making this all happen!",4 star rating

239,12/12/2017,"The Magic Castle presents a fun and unique experience to patrons that is built around the illusion of exclusivity and secrecy. No photos allowed inside, and you can only gain access through becoming a member, or by coming as a guest of a member.I came here with a group of friends for dinner and the magic show. The entrance, where cars are valeted, seems very Hollywood - nice cars pulling up, people dressed to the nines emerging and handing their keys to the valet, an outdoor photo backdrop where people waiting to get in gather to take photos with friends to mark the occasion.The whole experience will set you back about $100, between valet for the car, dinner, and the show. The castle itself looks beautiful, storied, almost like something you'd see in Disney Land. Stained glass, crown molding, intricate carpets - they don't build like that anymore.The food is your typical haute cuisine, French/European-type fare. Steak frites, beef wellington, a French chicken dish. Lots of big parties inside the restaurant all celebrating one occasion or another.The magic show we happened upon was interesting, but not Copperfield in Vegas. A little kitschy, but fun if you don't take it too seriously.Overall, the Magic Castle strikes you as the kind of place you visit once to check off the bucket list, and certainly fun if you can get tickets a second time, but not the kind of place you're dying to go to a third or fourth time.",5 star rating
240,1/7/2016,"Magic is real!  Magic is especially real at the Magic Castle on Halloween when they celebrate all week and on Founder's day January 2nd.  I'm surprised by all the sneak photos on yelp because photos are not allowed inside the castle except in the lobby.To go, you must be a member or be a guest of a member.Harry Potter fans out there or magical people will love the sliding secret book case that you say 'open sesame' to enter.  The walls and halls are adorned with photos and treasures of magical and Hollywood history.There are 4 bars... Lobby, down the south corridor, upstairs to the right of the restaurant, and downstairs at the magic bar.The restaurant is fantastic with scrumptious menu choices.  I have not had anything I don't like!Service is, well, magical!I love the close up room or magic bar for a great up close magic show.But my favorite room of all, perfect for cuddling and smooching, is Irma's room where the ghost of irma will play a piano version of nearly any song you request.  Don't forget to feed the birdie!  the memories of times in this room...*Swoon^On October 30th there was even a DJ and dancing, tarot reader and photo booth.  Magical night for me!On founder's day, January 2nd, it's members only plus 1 guest, and they roll the menu prices back to the 70s!!! Wow!  It's far less crowded.  Beef Wellington (delicious and available in their normal menu), Tomato Mozzarella Salad (yum!), Endive salad (loved it) for very low prices!They have nightly shows in several rooms including the magic bar and several impromptu magi running around willing to aww and inspire you!They also have a members only library and classes for those studying the magical arts. *jealous I could not go in*.I cannot say enough kudos to the Academy of Magical Arts for making this magnificent club house right here in Los Angeles walking distance from highland and Hollywood, and Madame Trousseau's Wax Museum.  And I can't thank my magical man for taking me as his guest on so many occasions over these last several months!  I think I lost my heart in these rooms.",5 star rating

243,8/9/2015,"Magic Castle...Very interesting, classy, and intriguing establishment. However, it is extremely clustered, and some of the aesthetics is a poor man's version of the enchanting Winchester Castle/Museum in San Jo with the deception attempts. I will segment this spot into various factors beginning with food/Food.Expensive. It can be pricier than Flemings et al. Le grub doesn't lack taste, but the overall experience is a bit much. Sea bass - nice flavor. They had some mashed taters on the bottom which was not necessary, and unfortunately the asparagus lacked, well asparagus flavor. Prime Rib - nice and juicy. For those who think I eat like a caveman, that is not the case. My method has madness, well, subjective madness associated with it. When it comes to prime rib... I have certain techniques:1. check to see if they can be splintered with a fork like a Hastings Ranch or Old School Lawrys cuisine, and then2. I don't cut into small pieces but see if i can rip prime rib apart with a thin, long slice with my delicate palettes for a matrix of reasons. 3. No horseradish or au jou sauce needed if the rib is bomb.The prime rib was pretty delicious. Not as soft, tender, and juicy as the $40 price tag, nonetheless, might be the best beef product here.Wellington - whatever the hell Huy ordered. It was covered with some nasty breading or fat or something gooey. The texture was hideous hence looking for the beef was almost like initially searching for a woman's all so elusive g-spot. however once found.. well use your imagination.Steak on a bone - this is what Dustin ordered. It was ginormous. Very healthy size with a nice looking bone. The steak had a wonderful thickness, and juicy elements to it however at $80 per slab. Damn, that's five or six pounds of the highest grade angus, grass fed beef at your local butcher shop. Tough pill to swallow. Pork Belly - With hindsight, this is what I might order in the future. Like five or six plates of this. The pork belly (sangyupsal) is the best my mouth has had the privilege of indulging in. It was juicy, flavorful, delicious with an immaculate proportion of fat and piggy meat. Sauce associated was not so great plus with the crap on top (some mixture of veggies). Macarons - All show no go. The presentation was pretty. haha the macarons were okay. Elf portions. I never thought a macaron can be crafted to dime sized fun sized shots.Rules -Fancy smancy pants, suit, and tie, and no pics to the interior. and if you are wondering, yes I took pics of the internal portions of the castle. It's the deviant rebellious nature within my soul. However I didn't take any pics of any shows or performances. This is a magic show, based on illusions, and deception. Watching videos can give out their secrets which will nullify the enchanment, mystery, and allure to the whole thingy.  Soliloquoy time =) i dress fancy all week. Today is a Satty, a nice day off, and it was f'n hot, outside and inside. I started to sweat at 2:30pm driving around with Maila's crazy ass, and I didn't stop damn sweating until 3:30am or so!!! Talk bout dehydrated... Thank God Huy had a jacket to fit my fatass, and a nice tie (emergency tie was tossed up) cause I didn't bring one of those as well. I went severely under-prepared (which rarely happens) but maybe a few hours notice would've been nice rather than the 45 minutes =P (extremely thankful for the invite). If I smelled funny to anyone, too bad =P, naw i'm sorry. I didn't get a chance to bath after my morning stogie session with the wise old white men at the local cigar establishment =D and cause i was sweating a lot.Ambience -Clustered. Not my cup of tea. Tall, big, extra large, wide loaded, horizontally challenged individuals (e.g., Joe P) may have difficulty with the constant stair cases, low ceilings, puny chairs, and 10-18 people capacity of the smaller venues. And I thought it was too damn hot in there. Maila, and Olin didn't think so, but they had 4% of the clothing men wore, and about 95% less fat to lug around.Shows - My personal favorite was the mentalist and his ability to merge human essence/energy (chi). That was wickedly sick to me. The first show where Olin (LOL) was the assistant started off pretty retarded, but the punch line was a Mike Tyson uppercut (or Rhonda Rousey right hook). That was good. The main performance was less magic, and more comedy. Be socially aware of sarcastic mocking points to the French, and German people to understand the complexity of the jokes =D =D =D =DHost -The manager was very pleasant to be around. Our 90 year old tour guide was amazing. 28 years at the castle along with 90 years of life! He claims to be from France, but his Brooklyn accent couldn't fool me. Overall I think this is a wonderful first date type of establishment. It has dinner, entertainment, intimate yet social ambience. I want to write more damnit! Maybe i will continue with the hotel **shrug** nice to see and meet y'll.",3 star rating
244,1/9/2019,"The hubby was able to score passes on a last minute Friday evening dinner and show. I've been wanting to visit this place, since I've heard the food is great and shows are fun.      The Friday we came before Christmas 2018 was packed. We arrived by 9:00pm. Thank goodness we had reservations, for we waited about 10 min for a table, but had to stand around amidst large crowds in the upstairs dining level.   We both had the filet mignon for dinner Milton style, and shared the calamari and mac and cheese. I would give the food 4/5 stars, since I've had my steaks ""Oscar"" style at other restaurants, and have tasted more decadent than this place. Total price of dinner for 2 is the same as an upscale steak restaurant. As for drinks, the Blood Orange margarita was soo good! I had like 3-4, and it reminded me of the margaritas at Los Toros.    As for the shows, we only saw 2 since we finished dinner by 10:15 pm. I would definitely recommend arriving around 5:00pm if you have the time, so you can explore the castle, and watch more of the intimate shows and rooms.   Definitely dress UPSCALE, suit/tux/gown/fancy dress. Also, you can't take any pictures once inside the castle ;(",4 star rating

There's an admission fee, valet is only $13, and the food/drinks are reasonably priced. Met really cool people. There are lots of cool rooms (shows, dueling pianos, etc.) and features to check out.

247,10/3/2018,"The Magic Castle in a rather large nutshell:  hard to get in, strict dress code, fun entrance, low lighting to set the mood, crowded, maybe not that hard to get in?, a couple of ""hey, that's the guy from...""  actors but no pictures..., a splash of good service, a heavy dose of mediocre food, one fantastic magician, others not so great, mysterious passageways to more closeup magic, a wonderful history, other magicians with outdated shows, and at the end of the night, when all is said and done ... expensive.",3 star rating
248,6/6/2017,"Abracadabra...The Magic Castle...it's so magical that you have to do an appearing act just to get inside. If you live in Los Angeles you might have noticed a huge castle off Franklin Ave. in Hollywood. Many people have seen the castle but they have not been inside. The secret is you have to be a special member to enter, which is pretty cool unless you're not a member. The good news is anyone can become a member with large amounts of money. However, if thats not an option you can do what I did; find someone who is a member and have them get you in, no magic trick required.  Members get unlimited tickets, so go make friends with some of them. If you're nice it should be easy to score some. If you come with a member this castle will be a lot more cost friendly. Members don't have to pay an entrance fee and get a discount on valet and dinner.  However, if you come without a member it's a little more pricey. Look on the bright side, at least you got in!I have been pretty lucky to have gone to the Magic Castle many times over the years. Some might say it's my magical charm. There's been tons of fun special events that take place at the castle and I even got to attend a few. My favorite was casino night. It was fun getting all dressed up and hanging out in the castle. I have been dazzled and awed by many spectacular talented magicians. I'm usually left in disbelief. I usually come on weekends and I find the magicians tend to be a bit better then. My last particular trip to the castle was on a Tuesday and I found the magicians were not as good as I remembered. The magicians are all usually amazing, so I do think it depends on the night.I have come for dinner several times and I always remember the food being mediocre. On my last occasion I got the asparagus soup. It was ok and served just luke warm. I like my soup hot. I also ordered the garlic cheese bread and a salad. Both not worth mentioning. I've had chicken dishes at my prior visits and the food consistently just tastes ok. I'm not really there for the food so my rating is based overall. The Magic Castle is a pretty special place to experience and I would definitely recommend coming at least once. They usually have such amazing magicians and the castle itself is a sight to see. It's truly a special place unlike anywhere else. If you enjoy magic you will for sure have a magical experience!",4 star rating

251,6/30/2019,"Clearly the people who are giving this overrated establishment five stars and glowing reviews aren't born and raised Los Angelenos because they are so badly falling for this hype. A friend of my mother's kindly invited my mother, myself, and some of our closest friends to The Magic Castle to celebrate my mother and our new beginnings. First off, the draconian dress code is absolutely ridiculous. I think it's only purpose is to keep the designers of sequin, flashy cocktail dresses in business. Additionally, don't get me started on the totalitarian rules they have in place here. A few of my friends and I stepped out of one of the show rooms to use the restroom. Upon our return to rejoin our group, we were denied entry and met with security being called on us as if we stole something. I think the real crime here was the three of us in the group being black at The Magic Castle, as let me address the elephant in the room here: The majority of the patrons of Magic Castle are white. Our second most heinous crime of the night was my mom and I having our pictures taken by our friend. The very inhospitable and rude staff member seized her phone and demanded she delete the photos. When she refused, he pushed her to the point my mom had to intervene. That was when we had enough. With the rules and the dress code, I felt like I was back at my strict Catholic high school but this place even made my high school days seem more lax. They charge Biltmore prices for subpar food and mediocre magic tricks that a five year old can perform. If that's your vibe, definitely come here.",1 star rating
252,9/15/2018,"This is the most unique place in LA - I have no clue why it took until my 8th visit to the city to even HEAR of it.First - find your way in. We hooked up with a member and everything went smoothly, but I hear it's not normally that easy.Second - the dress code is no joke. You really can't over-dress, but if you're unsure if you're dressed appropriately (check the website) you should call up there and ask. They will NOT let you in if you don't follow the dress code.Third - No cameras past the lobby. You'll have to rely on your memory and storytelling skills to describe what happens beyond.Fourth - Get there early, and hit every. single. room. I like magic as much as the next person, but it's rare you get to see it so up close, and it's mind blowing. There are several tricks you can figure out (or think you can), but the majority are so good you really can't tell. Some magicians are better showman than others, but all are highly skilled.There are 5 bars in the castle, and the building itself can be labyrinthine so make sure to explore a bit to see what's available. Take a show schedule so you know what's happening when, the stage show is great, and the best close up stuff was in The Hat and the Hare Pub. It was very unassuming but blew everything else away.As far as food - if you have reservations you'll have a sit down dinner upstairs. We came as guests so we were able to just order from the bar. Normal bar food, but it was good and easy enough to share. The down side to this is you don't have a guaranteed seat at the stage show, so you have to wait in line and hope there are enough seats for you.For drinks - get the Barrel Aged Old Fashioned - it's delicious and a whole lot less labor intensive than a normal old fashioned (they pour them direct from a barrel when you order). My wife got the Spring Time Sangria and raved about it - she normally sticks to 1 drink but got a 2nd it was so good.TL:DR - if you can get in to this place you MUST go. I know I'll be trying again!",5 star rating
253,3/10/2020,"I was not impressed with the Magic Castle.  I spent over $300 for 2 people and I don't think it was worth it at all. We were required to have dinner- the food was pretty good but over priced. The main magic show included with your admission ticket was ok. The whole experience felt pretentious to me, down to the fact that you have to dress up. There are various smaller stages/magic shows that you can try and see during the night but the place is so packed there's not much you can get into. There are various bars but to get anywhere you have to go up and down stairs and thru the restaurant every time- such an awkward lay out.  I was expecting something magical but it wasn't that at all. We left way earlier than expected as it was actually pretty boring.",2 star rating
254,12/2/2015,"I've been wanting to go to the Magic Castle for some time and never had the chance to when I lived in LA. But an opportunity finally came up to visit and my gracious magician friend who is a member hosted us when we were in town! The dress code is strict, but it makes for a good time to see everyone dressed to the nines! Just remember, no zippers! I totally overlooked this on my MK trench coat. Oops...but no worries, you can just coat check at the front! For some reason, I thought the Magic Castle was literally a castle on the hill by itself, so I was surprised when it was smack dab a turn off Franklin Ave. It's not that high up or isolated. When you see Orange Ave, turn up towards the hill. It's sometimes hard to see in the dark! And the ""hotel"" is the same thing as the castle. Valet is $13. My fiance was hoping his car would turn into a BMW by the time we came back out for some real cool magic. Cover is different during different days/times of the week, but apparently if you're a guest of a magician, you can get in for free! Thanks Tony! :)No pictures allowed except outside and in the lobby, before you say Open Sesame to the owl that lets you into the hallway behind the staircase. Equipped with 3 bars and a restaurant, the Magic Castle is sure to provide a good time. We opted to skip dinner because I've heard the food is only average for prices that are not so average (read: overpriced). My magician friend says some of the food is good but it's really up to you.The dinner, however, will help guarantee you entry to the Palace of Mystery, which is the largest theater and highlight show of the evening (~45 min). But, you can still try waiting standby for seats...which we were lucky to get! Probably because One Direction was in town that night and performing on Jimmy Kimmel, so traffic was bad and people stayed away....or they wanted to see 1D. Check out the telephone booth next to the Palace of Mystery for a little interesting phone call...The Close up Gallery is more cramped but you see...close-up magic. haha I was delighted to get pulled up to the stage and assist in an act. The Parlor of Prestidigitation was a medium size theater and also had great early and late evening shows! Sit closer to the front if you want to participate more in the acts :)Also, check out Irma the piano ghost. Tell her any song you want her to play and she will most likely be able to! Would love to come back anytime to see more magic tricks :)",5 star rating

260,5/21/2016,"Guys, this place is extraordinary in every way. If you love magic, mystery, old things, and classy-ness, then this place is for you! I love everything about it: how you have to dress up to go there (wear a tie or they will provide you with one), a piano played by a ghost named Irma, the intimate magic shows, the talented magicians who are also hilarious, the secret passage bookcase, and other magical touches. It feels like you're in a time warp when you step into the magic castle. Is it 1920 or 2016? Not sure. This food and drinks are expensive, but it's totally worth it for a unique and unforgettable experience! TIPS: Get there early so you can see as many shows as possible. Try to go on a week night, as the lines for the magic shows are shorter. Ask the bartenders which shows to see.",5 star rating
261,5/27/2018,"Thanks to fellow Yelper Morgan K., I was finally able to score an invite to the famous Magic Castle to celebrate my birthday.Like others suggested, I made dinner reservations for 6PM, but got there earlier at 5PM to try to catch an early show. Unfortunately we didn't make it into the 5PM Close-Up Gallery due to max capacity, but we were told there were random shows that pop up everywhere so to go down to the Cellar to check. We lucked out and were the first people in, so we got front row seats and loved being able to participate in the magic tricks.Next we went to our 6PM dinner, where I wasn't really expecting much. I ordered the prime rib, while the others in my party got the beef wellington due to our server's recommendation. While my prime rib wasn't the best I ever had, I thought it was still good, and the beef wellington was excellent! My boyfriend mentioned it was my birthday, and they brought out a nice little chocolate sundae and a glass of champagne for me which was a really nice touch.After that we headed over to the 8PM Palace of Mystery for the main show which we received tickets for so we didn't have to wait. We tried to catch the 9:15PM Parlour of Prestidigitation or Close-Up Gallery right after, but both were full so we decided to go back down to the Cellar to see if there were any pop-up shows. There was one going on at the bar, so we got to see some very cool tricks.I wanted to check out the Peller Theatre and were told there were 10 spots left for 10PM, so we just hung out for 45 minutes which wasn't too bad. After that we tried to get into the Parlour of Prestidigitation for Wes Mathison, and just made the cut for the 11:15PM show. Wes was amazing and we were glad we chose this for our last show.On our way out, we got lost and ended up being able to catch one last pop-up show! It was only 6 of us with the magician, so it was nice to be able to get up close and personal with him.Overall I had an amazing experience at The Magic Castle, it was pretty much like Disneyland for adults! I would suggest arriving at 4:30-45PM so you're able to get into the first show, and be sure to wear comfortable shoes because I made the mistake of wearing my Louboutins and was dying by the end of the night. If there are any shows you really want to get into, make sure to start waiting about 45 minutes ahead of time, but it was really nice that they had pop-up shows all over the castle for those who didn't make the cut into a show.",5 star rating
262,7/15/2015,"Everyone needs to come here at least once in their life! For the evening entrance, you must be 21+, dress up (cocktail dress for the ladies, coat & tie for the guys), and order one entree per person in the dining room. If there are any no-shows, there's a $25 fee. If you have one person in your party who is late, the no-show fee will be charged if they show up 30 minutes pass the dinner reservation time. To get around this, you can order their entree for them first. In April, I wanted to make a reservation but the earliest Saturday reservation was on July 11 so book early if you want to go on a weekend! I used uber to get there with a friend and I recommend asking the driver to drop you off curbside and you just walk up to the castle. Otherwise, you will wait in a line of cars wanting to valet (valet is $13, uberPOOL was $6 one-way). The walk up the hill isn't even that far up (4 car lengths). Another yelper recommended being dropped off at the front of the castle if you're using a car service because of this great big hill. I'm not sure what they were on or how short they were because this great big hill was not there when I got there.Before waiting in line to get into the castle, my friend and I took pictures in front of the Magic Castle background. But you can always step outside when you are already inside the castle to take pictures. They'll let you back in. Once inside, you are in the lobby and are directed to a podium where you pay the person behind it, the entrance fee. $30 Fri-Sun & $20 Mon-Thurs. In the lobby, you are able to take pictures with your friends. After paying the cover, you go to an owl (I'm pretty sure it was an owl) and say ""Open Sesame"" and a door opens....it's pretty cool. And then you're at the bar! Yay! Of COURSE I find my other two friends at the bar waiting for us. To get to the restaurant, you will see a set of stairs to the right. On they way up to the restaurant, there is another bar. There are a lot of bars in here. This is how they make their money so drink up my friends!The restaurant: The food is REALLY GOOD! We were all pretty surprised because we heard a LOT of bad reviews about how the food was not that great and it's about $40-50 an entree. I ordered the prime rib (my fav!) and my friends ordered the salmon, sea bass, and chicken. Everyone really liked their meal however the friend that ordered the chicken got really REALLY REALLY sick with food poisoning. She was out for 3 days. Luckily she didn't get sick until the end of the night so we all had a great time. After dinner, each member of your party gets at ticket to the main show. You get to the showroom by going through the restaurant (heads towards the back and then turn right. If you walk down a ramp, you're going in the right direction). Since our reservations were at 6pm, the show we got was at 8:30pm. The main show (Palace of Mystery) featured 3 magicians. 2 main ones and one that was more of a host. There are also other smaller shows (Close-Ups) that are 20 minutes each at specific times. For these, you have to go early and wait in line. It's first come, first served. And in addition to the scheduled shows, there are random acts around the castle. There were a lot of mind reading (ESP), card tricks, and rope tricks which got pretty redundant. Our favorite show was the very last one at 12:30am where we were practically falling asleep waiting to get in. It was a Close-Up act with Johnny Ace Palmer who was voted Best Close-Up Magician at the Magic Castle 2 years in a row! He's an amazing performer and made 3 chicks appear out of nowhere and pulled a freaking rabbit out of a hat! So cliché but so mind blowing at the same time!",5 star rating
263,8/11/2015,"How did I forget this place? One reason I enjoyed going here was due to what others bitch about: dress code. I suppose it would be the equivalent of being back in school days where you allegedly behaved better when you were dressed nicer. Case in point, I never had a bad time here. Another reason? The restriction of photo-taking, which certain people on here obviously violate. But for the most part, those that frequent here don't need to take photos.The private dining room was hidden away, and we had a larger party of about 10 or so. I remember the food being okay, nothing spectacular, but there was always something for even the pickiest of eaters. Then we went to one or two of the shows, and of course our group was the one who had the one girl who had the loudest, most obnoxious laugh, and she wouldn't shut up throughout most of the show. If you were there that night and heard her, I'm sorry. Another time I was down at the smaller bar with a friend who actually worked at The Castle, and I look across the bar and see a woman I work with (this was a good thing though, so I didn't hide). You never know who you'll run into while you're there, it's no illusion. I would have taken my usual photo of matches, etc. but this is the first place that I've ever been to that charged for the matches ($1), so unless I come to my senses, I'll do that next visit.Overall, this is a fun place to visit if you do get the opportunity. Plan on spending quite a bit of $$, dress the part, and you'll be fine.",3 star rating
264,5/3/2016,"If I could move here, I would. Irma's ghost captured my heart from the beginning. She knows how to charm a room for sure! I've had the honor of attending a few nights thus far and have been impressed each time. The bartenders are kind, personable, and one on the main floor really knows his whiskeys. I tried the chicken satay and street tacos most recently, and would definitely reorder the tacos for the flavor. When it comes to the shows, getting into the close up gallery is key. That room fills up so fast due to it's size, but if you can score a seat or standing room, it's worth it! Everything else can probably be seen throughout the night if it's a weeknight, and you're patient. I love all of the items kept here from various magicians throughout the years, it adds to the building's rich history. Some important things:-Valet is $3 for members, $12 for non members. -Photography isn't allowed past the lobby, don't be THAT jerk who ruins the magic of the castle. Save your selfie for later.

265,9/6/2018,"My group of friends and I had the most amazing magical experience ! The Magic Castle is an exclusive clubhouse for members of The Academy of Magical Arts and invited guests only. Truly I'm so lucky so have been able to go thanks to a very dear friend of mine. There is a very strict dress code policy so make sure to check out the main website for that. I was fortunate enough to get dropped off at the castle so I had nothing to worry about in terms of parking. But for those who are wondering,as a non-member, there is a $15 Valet. Someone from my group actually parked at a nearby lot and ended up paying $20 for the whole day so in comparison valet at the Magic Castle isn't so bad.The experience begins right as soon as you pay the entrance fee. ($25 for non-members). All I'm going to say is that a magical word gets you in ! ***HOGWARTS VIBES***We chose a 6pm dinner reservation (Guests are required to dine & are required to order an entree). The food was delicious ! I guess I had anticipated our dinner to be lower in quality but I was pleased and satisfied with everything that my table ordered. Our table ordered the cheese bread appetizer, 3 filet mignon all varied in sizes and each with different sauces, scallops, tofu, and a bottle of wine. My filet was super tender and the chimichurri sauce was almost as good as the one I make...almost. 9.5/10 for dinner. We each paid about $70-$95. After we ate, we made it to the 8pm main show, and had the rest of the night to explore and experience the close-up magic shows in the castle. We had a few drinks at the different bars and checked out Irma as well. (Irma is a magical piano player that plays the song your little heart desires to hear). By the time all the shows were done my friends still wanted to continue drinking the night away at Hollywood. The awesome staff and valet workers let my friend leave her car there while we enjoyed the night elsewhere ! Their customer service was at the upmost perfection !!! It was such a unique mind blowing night !!!",5 star rating
266,8/23/2017,"What a cool place!  I have lived in LA for about 6 years now and i've been trying to get an invite to The Magic Castle for years!Magic Castle is an exclusive, invite only, venue where you are able to have dinner and drinks, as well as watch shows performed by magicians.  Heres how it works.   Once you manage to score an invite you are put on a list, and upon check in you pay a fee and are granted entry.  The dress code is super formal and strict.  Ladies must wear a dress, and Men must wear a jacket and tie.  If at any point you take off the jacket, they will ask you to leave.Once inside there are multiple rooms throughout the house where you can see different types of magic tricks, and a bar to order drinks.  So initially you mingle through the house, and then gather for dinner in the main dining area around 8pm.  The food is INCREDIBLE, but definitely pricey.  (I had the Beef Wellington, and it would have given Gordon Ramsay a run for his money)After dinner, you go to the main performance which changes regularly with many of the other acts. Now, let me start by saying I had a great time!  However if I am to be honest I felt it was a bit cheesy.. Maybe my expectations were too high?  I was expecting world class magic. Like the kind you wait years to see because its so exclusive but I really felt like the acts I saw were pretty mediocre....like homeless person on Hollywood blvd mediocre... I know I know, thats harsh but I was honestly expecting more than card and string tricks.  I thought maybe the main show would be better, but  it was just a dude crawling in and out of a balloon.....I literally kept falling asleep.  That being said, the food was STELLAR, the drinks amazing, and The overall vibe was an incredibly fun time!  Probably not something ill do again, but definitely worth doing if you have a chance!!!!",3 star rating

A formal dress code and membership rules make you feel like you're a royal. Second, the castle itself is so enchanting. I can't even describe the feeling I get while in there. Third, you can really tell the staff loves what they do. From the magicians to the bearers to the servers! Everyone is so happy to be there and passionate about the castle. Fourth, the magic is AMAZING!! I'm going to be thinking about how it's possible for weeks! Fifth, on top of all this stuff, the food is tremendously delicious. A little pricey but trust me, you get what you pay for. The best prime rib I've ever had and the best wine too. Every part of the experience was amazing. Every. Single. One.

268,5/11/2017,"Dinner and a Magic Show... That sounds like a majestical way to entertain the in-laws, right? Well, I think my husband and I did a good job of that, however, I certainly have my words about specific things...- Valet Parking: Complimentary however TIP is generously accepted (duh)- No Photography: I totally get it, and shockingly respected this rule, however, it was INSANELY HARD because I'm THAT GIRL WHO LIVES TO TAKE PICTURES OF PRETTY FOOD and the Magic Castle delivered on that front. - Dress Code: I hate hate hate dressing up, but honestly, I didn't mind doing so for The Magic Castle, plus, my husband looks even more studly when in suit and tie. Oh and if you have NO DRESSY ATTIRE, well ladies, you're screwed, but gents... You can rent a sport coat for free, as long as you hand over your ID until you leave the premise. - Decor: Eerie, well maintained, totally in sync with the theme. The magic castle is basically a museum of magic history... With a few theaters inside so you can see shows.- Dinner: In order to up your chances (guarantee) you get a spot in the theater for the shows you want to see, making a dinner reservation is a VERY good idea, thus we got one at 8pm with the intention of seeing the 10pm show... And even though it's OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE... It was delicious and everyone agreed- oh and honestly when you think about it- the SHOWS ARE FREE, so really the menu prices reflect the cost of show tickets... So really dinner isn't as insanely expensive as one might think... That being said, here is the run down of grub ordered (I couldn't take pics!!):* Seared Ahi Tuna - DELICIOUS, THICK and HEARTY pieces of tuna... With spicy soy sauces. I only wished there were 5 more thick slabs!* Salmon Entree - I modified this dish so as to only have grilled asparagus with the simply grilled (no butter) salmon. AMAZEBALLS. Yes, I said amazeballs because I mean it. I think that was some of the best grilled asparagus I have ever had... And it took ALL of my energy not to order a special side for dessert. The salmon was BOMB too, not dry at all, like one might expect because I didn't get the sauce to go along with.* Short Rib - the entire plate was polished clean... IE: the meat fell off the bone and was so insanely flavored my husband basically LICKED his plate although he was trying to be classy so he didn't.* Fillet - Juicy, moist, perfectly cooked. No complaints.* Lobster special - Canadian Lobster that according to our (cracked out) waiter is sweeter than typical lobster... Did not disappoint at all. My father in law savored it with a huge smile on his face. * Lobster Cakes - I couldn't tell if these were good. They were not eaten very fast, and were offered up constantly to others to try... So I'm thinking ""not the best"". * Soups - TASTY AF... All I heard were slurping noises. Dinner was over around 9:30, which was perfect timing to go to the show at 9:45, for a 10pm start.- Show: I won't lie to you... The theater is cramped and uncomfortable. The seats are foldable... And I was sitting further in the back, thus I couldn't see much over people's head until my husband and I swapped seats. That being said....... I was WAY MORE DISTRACTED BY THE INSANELY DRUNK CHICKS WHO CLEARLY CANT HOLD THEIR BOOZE than the actual show itself. I did love when the performers referenced the drunk chicks in the audience, ha! Totally something I would have loved to do. But seriously, these women were loud, obnoxious hecklers. I feel like there should be a breathalyzer test before going into the theater, if you blow over a specific number, you CANT go in for fear you may ruin the show, which some of the women did for me. That being said, the guys performing were very funny- initially I wasn't all that impressed- and certainly knew how to please a crowd. - After the Show: there are plenty of other shows you can go see if you want to stay up late, which not gunna lie, I didn't really want to. I was kind of falling asleep by the 10pm show's end, so instead we wandered for about 20 minutes and then bounced. I'm really glad I was finally able to go to the Magic Castle, however... For me, it was a once in a lifetime event cause well, even though I know they are constantly other performers coming in and out, I feel like I've ""seen it all"". That being said, if I were randomly invited back, I wouldn't say no!",3 star rating

I didn't really know what to expect, but I thought it would at least have delicious food, given the fact that they make it out to be such an ""elite/secret"" type of club. The food was at best, cruise ship buffet or retirement home status. :/ and for paying $30-40/plate, you'd hope it was going to be much MUCH better. However, my server for the night did do his best to cater to our every need and he even went above and beyond and surprised me with a piece of cake and champagne for my birthday. His name was Ben, and he made our dinner!I didn't know what to expect with the show either. Unfortunately, I felt like the acts were a tad cheesy. They had the room laughing, but I'm not sure for the right reason.  Everyone that worked there, was super friendly... minus the girl at the very front desk. She acted as if we were bothering her, when we were trying to check in for our dinner reservations. Oh, I'm sorry you have to do your job!With all that being said, I probably won't go back, unless we have out of town guests that reeeally want to go. For the cost, I don't believe it's worth it. You have a better night, just going to a comedy club and eating bar food.",3 star rating
271,5/4/2018,"The show was solid, but not even close to worth the amount of money we spent on overpriced cocktails and flavorless prime rib. Also I'll pay through the nose for cocktails, that's fine: but why do I have to spend two hours of my night eating unremarkable food so I can see a 40 minute magic show? It seems like an inefficient use of time.Oh, and getting yelled at by ushers is a blast - thanks for telling us we have to get up against the wall for the predestination room or whatever it was called. I'm sorry but if I'm dropping 300 dollars to be here, I'd appreciate not being herded around by somebody wearing a headset.Pay separately to see a magic show, ditch the chintzy facade.",2 star rating
272,3/23/2015,"Last night I visited the Magic Castle for the first time and it was dare I say, magical.  We were invited by a member and our party met up when it opened to the public at 5 pm.  We didn't have dinner reservations and opted to grab some appetizers from one of the bars instead.  Food is served at the bar starting at 6 pm.  The member who escorted us in wanted us to experience some of the Close-Up Gallery magic shows and the Parlour of Prestidigitation show.  We even had some one-on-one magic with the member who invited us!  So for the evening we saw 4 different shows.  We didn't make it to the Palace of Mystery which is for dinner guests with reservations but Marc Summers was one of the featured magicians!  We grabbed some food at the bar upstairs by the Palace of Mystery.  Our bartender suggested ordering chili and the truffle fries because those would come out quickly.  I also tried some of the drinks: Mystical Melon, Side Car, and the Bulldog Bite.  My favorite of the evening was the Side Car.  Photography is not allowed inside the Magic Castle so I don't have any food shots for you.  The food was ok but what you really come here for is the magic.  There are so many talented magicians here that it's hard to pick and choose which shows to attend.  Whichever you do see, be prepared to be amazed.  It's mind-blowingly awesome.  That is all.",4 star rating
273,8/15/2019,"OK, entertainment AND beauty? You must be a magician!So, first thing, get away from Brenda!!! You'll understand that in a minute lol....I took this girl to Magic Castle to check out the live shows I've heard so much about.  So first they do this magic passageway thing to let you in, which is cool. Then I was all about getting some din-din.  I made a reservation for me and this girl. You go in, and it looks very cool. Then there is this girl waiting tables, an angel named Brenda.  I've never seen misdirection like that before, I'll tell ya what!The food was solid and the magicians were very enjoyable.  I liked the guy who did numbers board thing where you pick a number and then add something to it and divide and then he knows your number. Highly entertaining, even though my buddy Steven will gladly tell you how it's ""not magic."" Best part though is the dinner. I tried my best to make extended, passionate eye contact with Brenda.  I tried all night but didn't quite 'Iand the ho,' as it were.  Brenda was so busy focused on her job that I don't even think she noticed once. Strong work ethic, that's another thing I like about her.  I watched her whisper in the corner to a coworker before coming to my table and heard something like ""grown men who are going to a magic show."" She seemed nervous; so adorable! She came over to take my order though.  My date ordered too.  Too MUCH, that is! *rimshot*You wanna talk about nervous, you should hear the stumbling I did all over my own words when she took my order. I think I may have proposed, I'm not even sure lol!  Point is, it's a great place.  But keep your fu©*!ng hands off Brenda. Chicken was a bit dry.",4 star rating

The point is to allow yourself to give in to a time when people dressed up to go out, and it was ok to not be jaded by everything. If you are lucky enough to get an invitation, go all out and dress to the nines (think old school glamour/ classy, not slutty/ club style please), and check out as many of the smaller galleries as you can! Everyone employed at the Magic Castle is a magician, which means that even the doorman and your bartender can pull amazing tricks.

278,3/31/2018,"I've never felt so violated :( I can genuinely say, I have never paid so much for such garbage food. There is not a modicum of hyperbole in that statement. You literally pay 65$ for a tiny piece of dry, defrosted  salmon, and the same for the dry chicken. They FORCE you to buy an entree (I'm not making this up), and coincidentally nothing is less than 65$ (includes tips). The only magic trick that'll impress you is how quick they make your account balance disappear. Prepared to be severely underwhelmed. My friends and I sadly won't be returning.This place is a well constructed scam. Out of all the frivolous rules they enforce, too bad making edible food isn't one of them.

280,2/22/2017,"""Now you see it, now you don't"", said the waiter as he palmed my AMEX. Killing two birds with one stone is a magical feat. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, but a hand in the bush is worth your whole allowance. This is the Magic Castle, a place of consummate magic. It is as close to following Alice down the rabbit hole as you're gonna get in LA without chemical assistance. You will see the finest magicians in the World, shake your head all night and mutter ""How'd they do that?"", be mystified, misdirected, and utterly delighted at every turn of a card, sleight of hand, or slippery  performance. Magic is...well...pure magic.    The Dress Code, yes, Dress Code dredged up from the Cole Porter years, is strictly enforced.  And absolutely no photos of anything, anywhere inside. So, no bathroom selfies. A security force patrols until the last patron disappears.  There is a $20 cover charge, $13 to leave your Bentley Roadster, you must buy one main entree at dinner and no sharing either, so get your paws off my potato. For all this you are guaranteed a seat in the main theater, but for all the other small theaters plan on a 30 to 40 minute queue. Velvet Ropes, Rules, Regulations, and total magic to amaze and amuse. This unique institution is a tricked out Gothic Mansion, (nee, haunted house) with secret passages, hidden rooms, and an army of guides, hosts, (bouncers) to steer you to or from all of them...except the really secret ones. The whole place is a wood paneled termite gone to heaven carved and wainscoted throwback to another era. It is scrupulously maintained and spit polished like a West Point plebe's toe cap. Hand the Bentley keys to the Valet and go inside for dress check...check. Leave a fist full of 20's for your group and feeling foolish face the owl on the book shelf and say ""Open Sesame"" and like magic, you're in. (See if that works on Tinder). Of a sudden, you're in the bar (one of several) blowin' your bonus on booze. But that's what it's for, ain't it? Sip a few for a while before lining up for the Oklahoma Land Rush to rush upstairs to the elegant classic beautiful dining room where you can control the one thing that will disappear...food. Speaking of: The fare is yeoman like pricey Continental. Four Cheese Bread arrives soon and it is truly sinful but you're gonna eat it anyway because you can reach it. The Caesar comes on the bread's heels...wait a minute, you just ate the heels. No matter, order more. The salad is more or less MEH with boxed croutons, but eating something green is important unless we're talking about the steak. Go for the Ice Berg Wedge? It's all about the toppings, admit it.You ordered a no nutrient lettuce just because it is sitting under a confetti shower of bacon and Blue Cheese chunks. The Prime Rib was fine. It was served with a dollop of attention getting, nose running, eye watering Horseradish Sauce, a pretty baseball sized piped on mashed spud, and steamed vegetables du jour, (what didn't disappear the night before), Actually they were crisp as opposed to the expected mush and as limp as an ""It's Our Time"" third date. The Beef Wellington was nicely done too and you never see this construction project any more so it had to be ordered. Usually the pastry wrap sogs up in seconds, but this stayed in tact until the lovely tenderloin secreted inside was revealed and disappeared. The Petit Lady Steak served Oscar style with Crab Leg and Bearnaise was as delicious as the lady who ordered it. All in all the dinner was definitely decent. Dessert anyone?  A passable Molten Chocolate Cake and Banana Cream Pie (somehow the kitchen made the banana disappear on it's way to the table). This is a special occasion treat venue and is worth every farthing (sound it out, that's right...farthing), that you are gonna leave behind and there will be many. My companion was so impressed at the end of the evening's entertainment she wanted to know how she could come back soon. ""Work your magic, or turn a trick"", I replied.",5 star rating

283,4/8/2018,"The magic castle always delivers a fantastic experience, including good food and entertainment in a world-class venue! When attending, keep in mind the following:- The magic castle is the hangout location for a private club of professional magicians and associates. Only members and those personally invited by members can enter. The club has strict rules such as a formal dress code and no photography is allowed inside the building. Only people who are 21+ years old may enter. There are no exceptions to these rules; violators will be asked to leave and the member who invited the violator will be informed. Every person working at the magic castle and all members keep an eye out and report violations - it is their club so they would like their rules respected. Many of the negative Yelp reviews were from people who did not understand these rules and were asked to leave.- If you receive a standard guest card invitation from a member, then expect a somewhat pricey evening. There is a parking fee per car, an entry fee per person and all in your party are required to have dinner in the restaurant. Entre prices range from $25 to $50. Appetizers range from $15 to $20. The price of drinks varies. Most of the negative Yelp reviews were from people who did not understand the real cost of visiting the magic castle.- If you receive a standard guest card invitation from a member, then a reservation is required. If you want to attend on the weekend, then you might need to book your reservation months in advance. And just like any other entertainment venue, some weeks are better than others. Halloween week and the awards show week typically have the best performers. In addition, Thursday through Sunday have far more performers and showrooms than Monday through Friday (but also have far more visitors). Do your research and check their webpage to see upcoming performers so that you will see the performers who most interest you.Now for my review: I had prime rib for dinner for $40, with a garlic cheese bread appetizer. Food was professionally prepared and served with a generous portion of horseradish. The quality of food served was worth the price paid. Service was very professional. The server then provided tickets to the Peller Theater (I was given a choice between tickets to the Palace of Mystery or the Peller). The show in the Peller Theater was outstanding, with two performers telling the ""history of magic"" in a comedy/magic show. The theater was much smaller than the Palace, thus providing a far more intimate experience. I next saw a bar magician at the hat and hare pub in the cellar. Someone later informed me that this magician is among the best in the world, and I would agree. I later watched another amazing performer in the Close-Up Gallery who ended his cup and ball routine by magically producing 3 live baby chicks. I did not see that on coming!I could have watched more shows in other theaters. However, I chose to relax and enjoy the ambiance rather than stress out about racing from one showroom to another. So, I spent time having a glass of wine at a few of the bars. The Owl bar was crowded but I happened to find 2 open seats. I also spent about 30 minutes hanging out with Irma, the ghostly self-playing piano. Simply suggest a song and Irma will play it. And last, but not least, I took time to explore the different rooms within the building. The Houdini room has many authentic relics on display. The W.C. Fields bar area also has interesting museum items on every wall. I thoroughly enjoyed the evening (as always) and look forward to visiting again.",5 star rating
284,2/21/2017,"You can't experience anything like this anywhere else!! If you are even the slightest fan of magic you must come here at least once! If you are a fan, you will want to come back again and again!I am lucky enough to have been 3 times now without being a member. Although now I am tempted to start the process to become one. It seems that if you ask enough people, someone you know will pull through with a guest pass!Keep in mind, even with the invite you still need to pay the entry and meal fee. The first time I paid a flat rate of $100 which did not include dinner because by the time we booked our tickets the dinner option was sold out. But it was my first time there and for a Saturday night it was worth it!The second time we went for a brunch session. Which is a little cheaper than dinner ($25 cover fee vs. $35) and the brunch was a delicious all you can eat buffet with unlimited mimosas for only $35! Definitely worth it! The buffet was legit: it had an omelette station as well as fresh sliced meats and even crabs legs! There were fewer shows for the brunch session compared to the dinner session but we still saw plenty! During the day one of the rooms is reserved for kids because mornings are the times when people under 21 are allowed so that makes sense! It was also neat to see many young magicians at the shows, they were still very good!The most recent visit was for a Saturday night that I had to book 2 months in advance so be prepared for that! That was my first time dining there for dinner. The dinner was okay, prices are steep ($35 without tax and tip averaged per entree) and 4 out of our 6 meals were so under cooked we had to send them back. But the shows were amazing and there were so many we spent a good 5 hours there just watching the shows!Will definitely be back...just need to start asking around for some more guest passes ;)",5 star rating
285,11/19/2017,I kust went here for dinner for my aunts birthday and I have also been here several times before. Honestly this place is the best place to take a group for a literally a magical evening. The dinner is fantastic every time and I have loved every meal I have ever had here. I usually have the special chefs cut rib eye. Which is amazing and the lobster tail is a must. I really love the ambience and all the art and artifacts that are all over the place. If you want an amazing evening and a great night of magic then go here. Anyone who doesn't give five stars is a hater and don't believe it. We also saw Brian Gillis tonight and he was the best magician I have ever seen there. I usually can follow the magicians but he was honestly beyond amazing and extremely quick with all of his tricks. I would love to see him again!,5 star rating
286,3/13/2017,"Last month, my husband and I met a new friend who is back living in Denver after several years in LA.  When I told her we were heading to LA very soon, she asked if we liked magic.  I said no, my husband said yes.  We were both surprised by each other's answers. She said she had a friend who could get us an invitation to The Magic Castle.  I (mistakenly) thought it was touristy and hokey.  I figured it couldn't be touristy if you needed to be a member to visit.  Sold.The Castle is behind the Grauman's Theater on a hill.  This means parking is insane.  Valet is your only option at The Magic Castle and costs $13.  They were quick and it was a lively entrance, adding to our anticipation.As a guest, you will need to present your invitation or the official email to the greeter, along with your ID.  Quick and pleasant.You enter and pay your parking fees, along with the door fees at a reception desk,  These can be placed on a credit card.  Since it was a Wednesday, it was $20 per person. No pics are allowed after you enter!As a guest, you are required to purchase a dinner entree per person.  The full menu is online and it's old school American club dining.  Think Beef Wellington sort of fare.  Yelp reviews really panned the food but we found it quite tasty.  We chatted with a member who said there's a new chef on board since 2014 or so.  Maybe the reviews were for the former chef?We ordered the Wellington and Filet for our entrees, with a shared salad and banana cream pie for dessert.  Big portions, well cooked, served with fresh bread.  Our server was friendly, competent and knowledgeable.  I asked why our table was called the Cary Grant table.  Well...seems he was a bigwig on the board back in the day.  The ""no cameras"" policy was his so his friends could enjoy a night out with some privacy.  It held over.  Our 4-person table was Cary Grant's table with remaining phone wire that allowed him to ring down for any need he might have  As a LOVER of old Hollywood, this was the cherry on top.  I was enjoying feeling kind of touristy after all.  The ambiance of the whole space is WAY cool.  Mood lighting, lots of luxurious, heavy fabrics abound.  People were dressed in a wide range of outfits from semi-dressy to very dressy.  We walked up and down the stairs many many times so keep in mind you'll be on your feet a bit here.  Since we visited mid-week, there were 3 official theaters with scheduled shows.  We arrived at 6P, just in time for dinner and headed to the main show afterward.  We missed a magician performing in the smallest theater and wished we arrived at 5p (when the doors open). Your dinner reservation guarantees you a seating at the main show.  It ran about an hour and was part magic/part comedy.  Good.We hustled to both other theaters but the lines were very long and we went to the piano bar to spend some time with Irma, the knowledgeable ghost.  We were the first in line for the next close-up magic show and sat front-and-center, touching the small table.  Since the theater only seats 26 this is the most intimate and it was our favorite.  The performer was excellent and I could have watched him for hours.We made our way to the medium-sized theater next, the Parlour of Prestidigitation (say that one time quickly...) and saw another spell-binding act. In nooks and crannies throughout the castle, you'll find impromptu small quick stops.We were there for more than 5 hours and wished we'd gotten there earlier and had a better night sleep to stay later.Our trip to The Magic Castle was the highlight of our trip to LA.",5 star rating
287,1/21/2017,"Really a gem. I don't think there is anything else like it. There are certain rules and traditions here you don't even know about.  The secret society feel is part of the allure. I came as a guest of a member for Halloween when people were in costume. The house itself is huge, with various staircases and hallways. There are quite a few bars, staffed by unassuming bartenders who will suddenly show you some serious magic. There is a main show with multiple seating, guaranteed for only paid dinner folks. There is a standby line for others. I'd highly recommend paying for the dinner if you're lucky enough to get a guest pass. However there are many side shows, all of which are excellent. Plan to arrive by 5 or so to see pre dinner shows, and stay late past midnight to enjoy some of the other post dinner shows. Lots of waiting in line, but it's cool and worth it.",5 star rating

291,3/29/2018,"It's a cute idea, but the staff is so busy getting off on enforcing regulations they get really unpleasant and actually downright mean, and suck any sense of fun out of the evening. I was embarrassed that I brought a friend here. Maybe if you're a magician it's cool, but for outsiders it can actually be a really unpleasant experience. We were warned they have a strict dress code, so we were careful to follow it, but then the doorman told us we weren't dressed right. I had to open up their dress code on the phone and show him what it said to be let in.At the front desk the hostess loudly announced that we had to pay such and such for parking and such and such for cover--which certainly doesn't fit well with the ""high class club"" atmosphere they want. It's not my guest's concern how much I'm paying for an evening! Once inside, the food is palatable, nothing more, but at 40-50 bucks an entree and 12 bucks a side or salad, it should be GOOD (great?!), not mediocre, especially if it's mandatory to eat it.  And throughout dinner the maitre d' or manager or  bouncer or someone kept running by us to shout at people not to take pictures--again, not exactly the ""high class club"" feel they advertise on the website.But we came for the show. So how was that? Well, we got into only one (more on that later) and we did see a couple of decent performers--a very good juggler/clown, a woman(!) magician, and a guy magician/host, all professional and entertaining, though at one point they had a volunteer touch the woman's crotch for a joke and my date was made really uncomfortable. Do they even READ the newspapers? Do they HAVE to live up to outdated sexist magician stereotypes? There were also some substantial tech glitches (sound for the juggler blasted us out of our seats, but the woman magician's mike cut out so we couldn't hear her most of the time), but the show was enjoyable overall.We went to the line for a second show, and waited about 10 minutes before the ""host"" came up and said in a really nasty way to my date ""Very sneaky getting into line, but I'm not letting you in."" He then made a big deal of turning us away, and seemed to take pleasure in it. All, I guess, because he didn't ""approve"" us--though he wasn't even there when we got in line. I don't know if he expected a tip or bribe or something to let us in, but by then we'd had enough of the attitude and just wanted out.For the exorbitant prices they charge for mediocre food, the staff could really use a much friendlier approach. It might be a lot better if they stop making you buy the bad food and just let you buy tickets to the shows so you can get in and see what you want to see without having to deal with the resentful, kinda power-trippy hosts. Two stars are for a great idea. Missing stars are totally for hostile, unhelpful staff. The reservations agent and the waitress we had should retrain the rest of the staff. Meantime, we won't be back.",2 star rating

Dinner was surprisingly good! After reading the reviews, I was nervous that the food would be below average. My short rib was excellent, and my husband enjoyed his prime rib. There were plenty of acts to watch throughout the night, and I can see why some people stay until closing. My favorites were definitely the smaller acts and the closeup acts. The one at the bar was amazing, and I still can't get over it! We also experienced some cool acts from magicians who were just there. I can't wait to go back!",5 star rating
293,1/24/2015,"Like Magic?I do. Even if it means having to put on a suit and tie; the required dress code for visiting the Magic Castle. There's brunch and the afternoon show or there's dinner, with the evening show. I came for brunch and enjoyed myself. However, it's been said that the evening show is more entertaining. The afternoon show allows kids - but the evening does not. Not sure how that translates but I guess I'll see when I go back. More on that later.Valet parking. Or take your chances with street parking. Look up the address online and you'll understand. Just pay the fee and avoid the hassle.You can sit at the bar and have drinks, or wander around looking around or watching the various shows until your reservation to eat. I suggest asking the coordinators who is playing and where - otherwise you could miss some cool and funny acts. As for the food, it's brunch buffet style. Once seated, order drinks and then go and grab some grub. The food was suprisingly tasty with a carving station, as well as a kitchen. The kitchen made omlettes and sandwiches - I didn't ask what else - it's just what I saw on people's plates. This venue is for members or invited guests only. If you choose to have a photo taken and pay for it, you will be awarded the ability to return, with a guest list of your own.

294,5/25/2018,"I got invited to have dinner a couple weeks ago by my cousin and her friends. My first impression, I thought the place was pretty cool. From having to say a magic word to an owl for a secret door to open and to all the magic that was there! I liked that there were different shows going on and everyone was great. If you are a fan of magic, this is the place to go. People definitely dress up when they come here. I'm not exactly sure how strict they are because I thought some dresses were very casual. You can also take a look at their dress code. Guys definitely need a coat and a tie. So we had dinner reservations and we actually got to sit in the Houdini room! Which was cool because we got to see all the materials he used and pictures as well. However, dinner was a disappointment. For the price you have to pay, it is not worth it. I had gotten the filet mignon and it was pretty dry and burnt. Other guests had also said they have had better prime rib. Wish the food was a lot better for how much we spent. Overall, this place was a great experience!",3 star rating

But not matter what time or day you call, you'll wait 2 hours at the minimum. Stay away from this place until they introduce internet based reservation.",1 star rating
296,7/15/2018,"My friends and I had an amazing time. Left there mind-blown . I really hope to be invited back. So many different shows to see, different bars, so arrive early, Cary cash for tips, and drinks. There is a entrance fee, so be prepared to pay that, with valet, dinner was amazing, I sampled my friends as well since we all ordered something different and everyone's was just as amazing as mine. We arrived 2 hours early and still didn't see all these shows, sooo it's definitely non stop entertainment. Hope u enjoy it as much as we did.",5 star rating
297,9/7/2019,This is an amazing place to go for brunch or dinner and to watch some magic shows. Been there a few times and its always a good experience with different magicians in several different rooms. Even in the hallways you can find magicians doing card tricks. If you have kids you can take them for brunch on Sundays and they allow kids. It could get a bit expensive but it is well worth it.,5 star rating
298,2/1/2015,"I've been fortunate to come here two times now and its been fun both times!  Located in the heart of Hollywood, this is such a cool place!!  Very exclusive, you either have to be a member or be invited by a member/magician to be able to get in.  So if you do have the opportunity to go, then definitely try your best to go!  You have to be 21 and older!I love the vibe here.  They keep it classy and fun.  You even have to say the magic password so that the door will open into the castle!  You're entree fee is like $35-45 and then you add on a cover fee of about $30 as well.  Dinner will cost about $50 too as it is a requirement to eat there if you attend. It is a pricey experience, but it's awesome I promise. PARKING: Valet only. You just drive up the hill to the front entrance and valet is right there. It's about $13.  DRESSCODE: Really strict here, especially for men.  Men have to be in a coat and tie.  No jeans or casual wear for both men and women (includes no sandals, tennis shoes, etc).  ENTERTAINMENT: You're guaranteed into one show that comes with dinner.  Other than that, you have to make it into shows before it fills up its capacity.  The show you get a ticket for is the main show.  Sometimes I saw how the magician did their tricks and it has a cheesy sense of humor.  Enjoyable nonetheless. My favorites has been the more intimate shows in the smaller rooms.  Even magicians attend the castle, so I've been given personal shows with my friends as we waited for another show to start. REALLY cool experience and all the magicians I've seen have been amazing!!FOOD: You have to eat dinner here as part of attending the castle.  They have three seatings for dinners from friday to sunday at 6pm, 8pm, and 945pm.  The food isn't that great, just mediocre. But hey...you're here for the show.WOULD love to come back and experience this again!",5 star rating
299,5/30/2018,"How can you not love this place? Amazing Magic. The Hat and the Hare, or whatever the bar is called, is my favorite. A bartender that does jaw-dropping card tricks. The drinks are a bit pricey and so is the dinner, so be prepared. I've seen people complaining about the food, but I think the prime rib is great.",5 star rating
300,9/20/2018,"My wife and I went for our anniversary to enjoy some delicious food and watch some amazing magic. Given the reputation and prices we both had high hopes for a great meal. I had the prime rib and she got the filet mignon. Unfortunately, we both thought our meals tasted bland and flavorless. Not good when the bill comes to $300 which consisted of a mandatory 18% tip (not that our server didn't deserve that if not more) and we did add on a $135 bottle of champagne (it was a celebratory splurge for our special occasion). If we ever come again we'll probably just try to get away with some appetizers and leave it at that (we're not members but my understanding is that you have to dine there in order to get tickets to the shows). We went on Sunday night and it was still quite busy and we missed a few acts because the show rooms filled up. Of the 4 acts we were able to see, the one that impressed me the most was Robb Weinstock in the Close-Up Gallery. He was very talented and had a great personality. Overall, we did leave the castle in a great mood and very satisfied with the shows we watched (and the champagne we drank). It was just the food that kept this evening from being a 5 stars experience.",3 star rating
301,6/30/2018,"I was constantly impressed all night! There were so many wonderful shows that left me sitting there wondering 'HOW!!!?!'. I cannot wait to come visit again one day. I did not dine, but I did have a few glasses of champagne thanks to the lovely cocktail waitresses taking orders all over the castle. Also, the truffle fries are AMAZING. Irma was keeping the party going and would play anything we could think of! (Thanks for playing so much from Nightmare Before Christmas, that made my night even more special than it was already!) How did she know I loved it?!",5 star rating
302,8/5/2019,This place was so amazing!  What a unique experience!!!!  The only thing that isn't good is you need to know someone who can get you invited and parking is $15????  Ridiculous!!!!  On top of that you have to pay an entrance fee plus an entree which is expensive!  Be prepared to spend a lot of money here!!!  I wish that I stayed all night but I had work the next day.   You definitely need to see the main show and all the other extra shows going on in order to really get the full experience and to get your money's worth!!!,5 star rating

304,5/29/2019,"As you arrive, there may be a short line for the Valet. Valet parking is not cheap, but very convenient as finding parking in Hollywood can be difficult and expensive. The brunch was huge and delicious (we both had the lamb which was lovely) but the performances are stars. Houdini is only one of many who performed. And walk around the castle to see the unique interior decor in myriads of rooms, small theaters, bars. I highly recommend that you accept any invitation you get to experience this place!",5 star rating
305,1/3/2018,"Totally obsessed. I think that your experience totally depends on who you go with and how open you are to the experience. The Magic Castle has been on my ""to do"" list for years, but not really high enough to go out of my way to find an invitation. I'd heard from several people that while it was fun, it was overpriced (unless you are a member you have to buy dinner, which albeit is overpriced but you are also paying for the entire experience), the food was not good, and it is not a must do at all.I completely disagree. This is a complete must do... if you are open to it, that is, and go with a group of friends who are also open to it.  Some people go in as skeptics, heckling the magicians, trying to figure out the tricks, etc... if you are one of those people, this is not for you, and please don't go and ruin the experience for other people.I had one of the most fun nights of my life at the Magic Castle.  We had a 6 pm dinner reservation and stayed until they kicked us out at 1:30 am, and probably would have stayed all night if they let us.  A quick note on the food - which everyone bags on - yes, it is overpriced, and you are paying $40-$50 for an entree that should cost $20-$30, but the food is good and you are paying for the experience as well as the food.  I had no problem at all with the food, and quite enjoyed my sea bass. You can reserve tickets to certain shows (the longer ones, which are closer to 45 minutes) when you make your dinner reservation, and other shows (shorter, which are closer to 15 minutes) you can wait in line for once at the castle.  I don't want to say too much about any of the magicians are the shows, but just that I was completely blown away. Trickery or not, every show and every magician blew my mind.  And the magicians themselves were so kind and friendly, a few of them giving us private shows when we told them we hadn't been able to get into their show by waiting in line.  We were used as the volunteers in many of the shows (I think our enthusiasm was infectious) which really made the experience, particularly with the mentalist who hypnotized one of my friends.Rules:1) Formal attire. Dresses for the ladies, preferably long, but I saw some people in shorter dresses and some even in skirts.  But definitely nothing that resemble pants, shorts, or skorts.  Coat and tie for the men.  Two of my friends were given clothes to put on because they did not meet the dress code (they very discreetly check you out while you are in line and pull you aside if there is an issue).2) No photos anywhere in the castle, including in the bathroom (but taking them in the bathroom is a thing, and everyone does it). There is a step and repeat in front where everyone takes photos.3) One entree dinner minimum per person - no sharing. I believe there is also normally a $30 door charge which we had waived.How to get an invite:1) Know a member or anyone who knows a member. They have an unlimited number of guest passes and the member doesn't need to be present for you to attend.  Anyone can sign up to be a member, but it's a $4K initiation, $1,500 annual fee, and about a 4 month wait list at the moment.  Members - if present - have no food or drink minimum and no door charge, and can bring any number of people that they want.2) Know a magician. Most people I know who get tickets to the castle encounter a magician somewhere in life who extends them an invitation. It could be here, or at another venue, or a private event etc.Tips:1) Valet parking is $3 for members and $13 for non-members. Make sure not to go up the hill to Yamashiro which is right next door (my uber driver did this by accident).2) Make your dinner reservation as early as possible to experience the most of the night.  Get there early because there is a line to get in.",5 star rating
306,8/14/2018,"Went to the Magic Castle 7/28/18 for the first time with my fam to celebrate my son's college graduation. We had 6 people for dinner. Valet was $15 and cover was $35 per head.  We were all over 21 so they NEVER checked ID. I usually post pics, but they are very strict about no pictures inside!!It is an old historical building. It is multi - level and like a maze. We were all dressed per the dress code.  They need to crank the AC because it gets crowded. We were all sweating!! They really push the bar and we felt slightly pressured.Dinner was good. It was over priced, but it is what it is. It is pre-prepared.  We got it super fast.   You're there for the entire experience.  Lamb - Very good with sauceBeef Wellington - Very good Sea Bass - Very goodScallops - Very goodIt thought the portions were a little small for the price. We saw several shows. One in a large theater and some in smaller theaters and some where only 10 people could fit. MOST of the shows were really good and mind blowing.  However we accidentally saw how some tricks were executed. You are REALLY close.  You want to go early and see as many shows as you can before and after dinner. Your main show is ticketed, but then you can wander and see other shows.  Easily 3 - 4 hours worth of entertainment. I was very happy!! I wanted to go for years, but could never score an invite. My family really enjoyed the whole experience. We would definitely go back. We would save it for a special occasion because it is expensive, but worth it.",4 star rating
307,12/19/2016,"Yay!!! I was lucky enough to have a friend invite me here this last weekend!  Food: 3 StarsNothing Special... a little over priced for what you get. The bread basket here was very tasty though!!!  We ordered the Crab and Pork belly Ragoons which were enjoyed by the whole table.  And I ordered the vegetarian special which was a pumpkin gnocchi in a butter sauce with cashews and pear.  It was good but I wish it was in a better sauce than just butter.  P.S.  They also have vegan specials not on the menu!! Cost: 2 StarsCome on.  You know what you are getting into.  As others have stated.  $13 plus tip for valet..... awesome that you can pay inside with credit card! Drinks are standard for a Hollywood club: average $15 and dinner will run you anywhere from $30-$50 per person.  We came with the VIP card so our door fee was waived which I understand is an additional $30.  Just plan on it being a $200-$300 night for a couple.Waiting outside for 45 minutes in the cold in heels.... 0 starsWhyyyyyyyy????  I understand you want us all dressed up but to have no heaters outside on a cold night with girls in dresses and heels with no place to sit, something needs to change here.  I have no problem waiting... just put some convenient benches (They have some but not where you wait in line) or better yet have bar service!!!Valet service: 2 starsSlow.  Expect to wait a while in hellish traffic to get up the hill to valet your car, and on the flip side, to get your car when you want to leave.Dress Code: 5 StarsI LOOOOOVE how strict the code is!!! There aren't too many place in LA that you get to get all fancy without sticking out like a sore thumb!!!  Men, must leave jackets except when at dinner or inside the showrooms.  Ladies be prepared with a dressy jacket or they will make you coat check it!  Fur is ok, but watch out for leather jackets!  Experience: 193576034 starsOnce you walk inside... you immediately forget about the terrible cold outside and the fact that you can't feel your feet!  I'm not gunna say too much here... just that what a fun concept and a fun venue to enjoy tricks and fun around every corner!!!!  Be sure to visit the Owl bar and have a chat with Archimedes.  The only thing I wish was to have to more time so I could've seen all of the acts!!!!If you get the chance to come here, take the opportunity and suck it up and pay the hefty penny to enjoy a unique experience!!!  I'll be back in January and I can't wait!!!",4 star rating
308,5/10/2018,"I came here last night for the first time and did not really know what to expect- I just knew that the dress code was supposedly strict.When I arrived, I saw people dressed like they were going to the club, which is fine and actually a lot better than what the Castle tries to be- which is very uptight. Anyways, dinner was overpriced but I had the rack of lambs and was actually very happy with the taste, and the cocktails were not good, with the sangria being so so sweet. WORD OF ADVICE: the simpler the drink, the better- these bartenders are not good at what they do, and they will stop paying attention to you if you are not immediately ready to order a drink. The show that followed the dinner was pretty cool- a lot of birds were pulled out of a lot of napkins. After that, we roamed around and I had my mind read. Pretty cool stuff, but a little over-hyped for sure.",3 star rating
309,8/2/2018,"tl;dr Something you must experience, truly unique and worthwhileWe've been to the Magic Castle 5 times over the past several years and love it [just] about as much as we did the first time we went. We went on a guest pass this time on a Fri. night for an 8:30 dinner reservation. We got held up in traffic, so while we planned on getting there at 7, we didn't make it till 8. We ate dinner and then figured out which parlors/rooms we wanted to check out and in what order.Unfortunately, it was incredibly crowded. We don't recall ever being there on a Fri. night with so so many people there. We usually make it a point to check out the close up gallery and Parlor of Pres. first bc the magicians are excellent. This time, we were 0 for 4 -- couldn't see a single one. We'd get there 35-40 mins before the show time and all 3 times, it was roped off saying the line was at capacity. Usually, if you're in line 40-45 mins before the performance, you're likely to get into the smaller parlors.Nonetheless, we had a great time w the other set performances and the members we'd meet at the bars. Knocking a star bc (a) they need to limit the reservations or people inside ...it feels almost like they let anyone/everyone in and (b) you still can't get away from the obnoxious, near drunk loudmouths. The worst this time was at Irma's area -- a lady was clearly drunk, dropping f bombs and leaning over onto Irma's chair screaming her requests. It was so noticeable and yet no member or bartender seemed to care that she annoying the whole room. It really ruins the experience.If it's your first time going there on a Fri. or (god forbid) a Sat., try to get there around opening. That way you can spend some quality time getting to see the close up stuff and check out the memorabilia. Thurs. nights are probably the best night to go. Same performers that'll be there Fri., but the crowd isn't as bad.",4 star rating

311,9/2/2017,"The Magic Castle is a private club for magicians.  While only members and their guests are allowed in, if you ask around, it's not too hard to find a member who can get you in.  If you're ever visiting LA, I would make this a TOP priority!!!  I can't really begin to explain how amazing this place is.  There are magic shows going on constantly in different theaters throughout this large mansion.  From the giant main stage where they do large, produced acts, to the close up gallery which does card and coin tricks.  They are all amazing.  Not only that, but there are magicians everywhere testing new tricks and performing for each other, and you can walk up and watch.  The magic is truly incredible.The place itself is also amazing!  You just won't find a place like this anywhere else in the world!  There are fun secrets everywhere!  Keep your eyes peeled at all times!  Go in the phone booth!  If you see buttons around, push them!  This is like Disneyland for adults!  The one thing you have to accept about this place is that it's not going to be a cheap night.  While there are exceptions depending on who and how they get you in, most of the time you will pay a cover and are required to eat in the dining room, which is very expensive!  It is fun though.  One tip is that if you're hungry and somehow aren't required to eat in the dining room, you can order food from most of the bars.  Last time we ate at the downstairs bar that had tables and everything.  That food was much cheaper than the dining room.  There are bars throughout, but drinks are expensive.  So just make sure you come prepared to spend some cash.  After drinks, food, valet, and whatever other expenses you have, this could EASY be a $200 night for a couple.  Easy.  Make sure you dress up.  They have a strict dress code.  Look at their site for the dress code.Usually when things are crazy expensive, that is reflected in my review... but this place is so worth it, that it's simply the price you pay for this experience and it's worth every penny.  Put this on the bucket list for sure!!!",5 star rating

314,1/13/2015,"The Magic Castle is an essential LA destination stop for any magic fan.  It's mysterious, exclusive and lots of fun and even has food/drinks to match.  Although you aren't going to (mostly) get the Vegas-type mega magic shows here, I believe you'll get the best kind of magic here - the one that deceives you right in front of your hands, sitting literally inches away from the magician in so many cool settings.  The Castle itself is full of tricks in all the nooks and crannies and the drinks are solid by the way.  Even the food isn't too shabby (and highly recommended to also get tickets to a later show which you'll need to get tickets for anyway).  How do you get in?  You literally have to know someone that works here/is a member or know someone that knows someone (or you can enroll in their classes).  You'll have to pay a fee as well for cover with having to valet (unless you Uber here) and you can't take pictures inside but again, for magic fans, what in the world are you waiting for?  One of my favorite LA destinations.",5 star rating
315,3/27/2018,"What an amazing place! The first time I was invited to attend the Magic Castle I hardly knew anything about it, or magic for that matter.. After I left the only thing I could think about was when I was going to get to go back!From the moment you walk it feels like you've almost been transported back to the time of speakeasies or the Moulin Rouge in it's hay-day. Everyone is dressed to the nines and the atmosphere is like nothing I've ever experienced. Everywhere you look there's something to see, whether it be magic tricks or historical pieces behind museum glass.. The castle is truly a special place.The food is also something else. They offer multiple courses and the quality is top notch, as well as presentation. The dining room is very elegant and the servers were great. Even while we ate performers would come around from table to table performing magic up close.Throughout the night we watched multiple performers on a bunch of different stages, from large stage performances to face to face right in front of your eyes. I had no clue how they did the things they were doing. It was a lot of different types of magic too, not just cards but everything, doves, hats, sleight of hand, mentalism, predictions. If you could think of a kind of magic someone there was probably doing it. It was truly a night to remember!",5 star rating

317,7/7/2016,"About a year ago, Tim C. brought my friend, Kanoe, and me to Magic Castle and told us that we cannot dine here because we need a special invitation from a Magician who is a member of the Academy of Magical Arts here. I thought I'd never get to go inside because I don't know anyone. So, Kanoe and I just took photos of the outside of the building and the cool fountain.Fast forward to May 2016... I was visiting Los Angeles again and our friend, Stevo (LA Yelp), had an invitation to Magic Castle for 8 people. He said that I could invite a few friends to dine with him and his family... YAY!  However, - the Magic Castle was PACKED, so we had to wait until July for an opening.  That's why I HAD TO return to LA... because Stevo made the almost impossible possible!  Mahalo! Stevo suggested that we meet at 7pm for our 8pm reservation. Good call! The place opens at 5pm and has magic shows going on in different rooms.  It's first come, first served for most of the Magic Shows.  There was a visiting magician, Ralf Gagel, from Germany.  We got in to his 7:45pm show in the ""Close-Up Gallery"" room which made us a few minutes late to our 8pm dinner.  Stevo and his family were able to get into an earlier show with another magician in the ""Parlour of Prestidigitation"" room.The Magic Castle has a very strict photography policy.  The goal is for guests to enjoy their time with quality conversation and complete attention to the food and the shows.  When you enter the lobby, put your camera away and observe all of the decorations (look for the portrait with the moving eyes) and subtle humor all around the unique environment!  The Dress Code is also enforced - men must wear coat and tie.  (Tim can tie one on without looking in a mirror!)The reason for 4-stars instead of five is for their customer service.  We understand their adhering to rules.  However, the manner in which it is enforced can be improved.  For example, when we had reservation questions, the person on the phone was a bit abrupt.  Also, when one of our party members arrived early and was unable to find the name of our sponsor on the Guest List, she wasn't treated with the best care.  Enough said.The most fun part of the evening for me was bringing Sue and Yuri inside from the lobby.  I had entered earlier through the magic bookcase with the ""magic word"".  Watching them say the ""magic word"" to the owl on the shelf was the best - they didn't believe me, so their hesitation to speak to the owl was priceless!The dinner portion of our evening was almost perfect.  It was a bit rushed because our server gave us tickets for the 10pm seating of the main Magic Show with three acts.  No food can be taken into ""The Palace of Mystery"" room.  Our leftovers needed to be boxed and stored at the Front Desk with our names on it.  Only drinks are allowed at the show.  We were celebrating Gloria's birthday and tried to take the complimentary dessert with us, but I had to give it to a stranger outside the showroom!  Arg!  They even took the cheesy lavosh from my hands that I wanted to munch on!  Uhg!  I had to chug my Cosmopolitan (thanks to Van for ordering for me) because I was carrying Gloria's complimentary champagne (thanks to Sue for being a fun drinking buddy) in my other hand!  Anyway, the service was excellent and my Beef Wellington (thanks to Yuri for pointing it out to me on the menu) was superb - loved the crust and the moist and tender meat!  Thanks to Stevo for asking for the House Bread - if no one was watching, I would have had all of the lavosh... haha!After the dinner and Main Show (Justin Willman, Brett Loudermilk, and Dan Sperry), we toured the many rooms and different floors.  In almost every corner, there was a magician performing a ""Close-up"" show where guests pull up a chair and sit around a table to enjoy a private and intimate slight of hand.  Magicians are so intriguing and full of humor!  We weren't able to figure out any of the tricks!Like Stevo said in his review - when you work hard for something, you'll appreciate it more.  After jumping through all of the hoops such as the exclusive invitation, the $30 cover charge, the $17 valet, and the $40 meal, this turned out to be a memorable and Magical evening.  I think I might have to make a speech about it one day... hopefully... and perhaps I will conclude with ""...and they lived happily ever after...!""  (wink, wink)Thanks AGAIN to Stevo for inviting us to dine with you and your family!  Mahalo for sharing your extra seats with us - we all thoroughly enjoyed our time together at this Los Angeles Landmark!  I'm thrilled to have accomplished another one of my Bookmarked places!",4 star rating

320,4/2/2018,"Magic Castle was a nice, fun experience that I had been dying to try in the last year. I was fortunate to have a ticket fall onto my lap (not literally) one day. The pass allowed for me to bring 5 other guests with me.There are several rooms where there are constant magic shows going on at different times. One would want to pace their time out wisely to get more out of your time there. Sort of like when you'd go to Disneyland and have to make sure you plan out your itinerary so as not to miss the shows or parades.In order to get into the main show, your party needs to attend the dinner. If you have a no-show in your group, there is a fee of $70 per no-show charged to the cc on file.Dress code is strict (more so for the men), a tie must be worn for dinner. They have loaner ties though if you didn't bring one. Dinner was probably my favorite part. Service was all-around great at Magic Castle but our waiter was phenomenal. The food was awesome. I wish I was allowed to take a photo of what we had, but let me try to describe what I remember to the best of my ability.Our table shared some amazing flaky, crispy Brussels sprouts. We also had the truffle fries which were just how I liked em--very truffle-y, garlicky, and the perfect ratio of crispy fries to ""soggy"" fries.We also had the truffle Mac & cheese but I didn't quite have much of that. It was pretty good, but probably not what I was craving at the time.I had the 14oz Houdini prime rib Cajun style. Definitely a pretty good steak, but not the best I've ever had. The mashed potatoes were very creamy and delicious. The parsnips and carrots it came with were perfectly al dente and lightly sweet.My friends had the filet mignon, the gochujang pork osso bucco, and the humongous tomahawk steak. But let's let them write their own long, epic reviews, shall we?We all shared 3 different desserts:The banana cream pie, the chocolate lava cake, and the creme brûlée. I'll cut to the chase and say they were all good but the banana cream pie ""takes the cake""! Sooo, so good. Very creamy, light, and just the perfect amount of sweet. We finished that one so fast despite our already-full bellies.Thank you Magic Castle for your amazing staff and amazing food! Would love the opportunity to go again some day soon.",4 star rating
321,1/18/2015,"Oh oh oh it's magic, you know...This was such a unique, exclusive experience!  My boyfriend and I gathered 2 other couples and had a magical evening in Hollywood. Drove up the hill to valet (mandatory) and waited for the rest of our party. The bf got tix from another member but we were required to pay an entry fee and dinner. After taking pix in front of the backdrop and getting IDs checked, we were ushered into the lobby, where we paid the entry fee. I wasn't allowed to take pic once inside. There is a little gift shop to the right of the cashier with pins, card decks, wine holders, books and glassware. After we said the password, in we went to the 1st of 5 bars. We had to push our dinner res out 1/2 hour as some of our party was late, but they were very accommodating. To pass time, we gazed at the oldness  of the place, almost Victorian style. We hit the Owl Bar next and grabbed wine and cocktails. After we were ready for dinner we were seated in a small room with some other patrons. You can eat at the various bars too if you didn't want/weren't required for dinner. The menu had apps like calamari, salads and main courses. Most of my group chose salads and beef dishes-prime rib, IPA braised short ribs, Beef Wellington. Another got sea bass and I had lamb chops. All came with potato and green beans and carrots. I thought my meal was delicious! We also ordered the cheese bread (do it!!) which was divine. Entrees run between $25-$40.After dinner, we headed to the Palace for the big show. Tix are included if you order entrees. As others said, getting in line early is key as the rooms are small so seating is limited. There was a comedian/magician and 2 main acts. I liked the Spanish magician more than the man who made birds appear from handkerchiefs ( I think the birds were fake or drugged).We then walked around to find another show and ran into a man who did card tricks that were a little scary. We searched for the other 3 bars and just enjoyed the atmosphere. The night was just so fun!  If you get an invite, go; it's really a cool thing to check off your bucketlist!",4 star rating

323,10/25/2016,"A MAGICal experience from the beginning to the end.To experience the Magic Castle one has to be invited by one the magicians.  I was lucky enough to get invited by a friend of mine.  We made reservations two months in advance for a Saturday and the earliest dinner reservations available was at 9:45pm.  There is a $40 entry fee per person.Magic Castle: Before you enter a guard goes over the rules for the Castle.  Some things to note:1) No photography! If you get caught you get kicked out2) Tricks are being performed all through out the magic castle so get there early! Our reservation was at 9:45pm and I got there at 7pm 3) Dress code is enforced! Make sure you go online to know the do's and don'ts 4) Etiquette at its finest! I felt like royalty with the way I was treated. The Magic: Majority of the tricks are card tricks but here and there the magicians will surprise you with something else.  If you have dinner at the castle you automatically get tickets to the Magic show.  The show is approximately 45mins long and features 3-4 magicians.  Overall I thought the magic tricks were impressive and at times I was like ""How in the world did you do that?!? "" All the magicians get the audience involved and will even request for you to be apart of their trick.  One magician after his performance did some personal tricks for my group and I which was really awesome! Food: A fine end steak house menu.  My date and I both ordered the filet mignon.  You get two size options, 6oz and 9oz and the filet comes with a side of vegetables and mashed potatoes.  We also ordered a side of Mac and cheese.  My filet was cooked more well done than what I ordered but it was still savory and flavorful.  The portion of the Mac and cheese was perfect for the both of us but we weren't too impressed with the flavors (tasted bland).  Overall the castle was a magical experience and I was so impressed with the ambience, decor, and the entire vibe it portrays.  Tips:1) Book in advance!2) Arrive 2-3 hours before dinner reservations to experience the castle to its entirety3) Follow the dress codeEnjoy!!!",4 star rating
324,7/30/2018,"The Castle is on a main Hollywood intersection is a cool looking place that as a local, we pass by all the time.  The Castle is not easy to get into, which increases it's mystique.  The Magic Castle sits on top of a small hill which makes it very visible and not hidden in secret.Getting in seems to be a secret, so from cheapest to expensive:1) Know a magician and come with the magician (this way seems to be the only way to come for the show and opt out of the dinner which was $110 per person).2) Email a magician, and get an invite.  This is supposed to be easy as I hear the magicians are encouraged to give these invites out.  Charges:  Door charge ($25-$35 per person).  Brunch around $45 per person or Dinner $110 per person.3) Stay at the Adjacent Magic Castle Hotel / Have someone you know sign up to become a magician by taking magic classes at the Magic Castle.  $300 plus the above (door and meal) charges.  The Hotel is a great idea if planning to drink (don't drive), want to enjoy a top rated, award winning hotel, and have kids that want unlimited snack and popsicles from the generous front desk staff (pretty much all kids).We decided to spend the whole day at the Magic Castle, brunch with the kids and dinner for the 21 and over.FOOD:The food is good and unless someone is coming with a magician, everyone has to eat.  Brunch:  $45 for a bottomless mimosa brunch buffet.  Warm breakfast offerings, prime rib, fresh large shrimp on ice, crab pre sliced down the middle so the outfits remain intact, omelette bar, pretty much a top of the line brunch buffet.Dinner:  The average plate on the menu was around $45 with $70 dollar specials such as lobster etc.  We got an appetizer, salmon and salad and Zinfandel and probably the most amazing banana cream pie with nutter butter crust and we were not disappointed. Dress code:  Look on the Magic Castle website and read each dress code line.  And avoid the generalizations like ""Country Club Casual Attire""  because then you might think, ""well I golf in this outfit"", so it should be fine or maybe stop at the 1st line.  READ EVERY LINE of their dress code and double check it on each piece of the outfit.  The door people are very strict and can be strict as the clothing stores of Hollywood and Highland are 2 blocks away and they will send you shopping.  The dress code at night is easy.  Tie and jacket, jacket should generally not be removed.  Easier.MAGIC:There are a variety of magicians and it was tons of fun seeing each magicians style.  For the largest main stage, we had a Vegas style performance to music with large stage filling props.  Very entertaining and much like the magic we see on TV.The close up intimate tricks are fun also, almost everyone does impossible card tricks that entertain every time, even though we see different iterations and styles of the card trick, the trick is performed with such skill that it's amazing to see again and again.The castle itself entertains also.  The bookshelf that opens with saying a password is a big hit and very fun, even for adults, also the last official photo op.  The piano played by the ghost Emra seemed standard (Alexa or Google home can take song requests now also), until Erma responded ""Your Welcome"" to our ""Thank you"" at the end of the song.  Impressive.Overall, it was a great time and a great experience.  If a manager is reading this, send some invites my way?  Would love to go back in the future.",5 star rating
325,8/10/2017,"I highly recommend the Magic Castle. I recently went for my birthday with 5 people, and we had a great night. Although I didn't get any special perks or badge (like some Yelpers mentioned), I still had an amazing time.We were seated right away (reservation at 8:00 pm), and service was quick. Our meals came out all at the same time so no waiting around. The food was excellent. I ordered the filet mignon which was cooked exactly how I asked, medium rare. It was juicy and you can practically cut it with a butter knife with no steak sauce needed.The magic shows were fun and entertaining. We saw a close-up and got into the Parlor of Prestidigitation. Your dinner reservations included tickets to the Palace of Mystery, which is the longest show of the night.The only complaint is the loud and obnoxious drunk people you might have to deal with. I would like the magic shows more if I didn't hear them talking during the shows. I would think that considering you pay a lot of money for the experience and you dress up, that people would have a bit more class and behave accordingly.[TIP] It does get expensive, but you can pay everything using credit cards so you don't need to bring a lot of cash except for bartender/valet tips.",4 star rating
326,2/20/2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed myself although, they should really get professional hostesses and not young valley girl-ish ones that are clueless. Initially, my reservation was for a party of 2, however, my girlfriend got food poisoning from lunch and even after a nap, she could not rally for the cause. Not to be deterred, I went anyway and after explaining the situation to the hostesses/check in clerks, I was assured it was no problem, although I checked my cc the next day and they charged me anyways. I have called 2 different accountants over the course of 4 days and have yet to hear back, but I am hoping this oversight will be resolved soon.I am a huge Harry Potter fan, so I loved the ""bookshelves"" with HP books and various books of magic. What's really cool is that when you say ""Open Sesame"", the ""bookshelves"" slide open. I know, I'm a dork, but it's still rather cool.As soon as I was seated, I was greeted by Celina and she totally took care of me. For my meal, I had the shrimp cocktail, sea bass, and pistachio brûlée. Everything was delicious, but the sea bass melted in my mouth and was outstanding!After dinner, I attended the main show and Mark Haslam ( who put on an amazing show) called me up on stage! I fumbled the card shuffle on accident and he still got the cards right. Talk about magic! It was so fun!!! Yuji and Mariko were also a delight, but Dale Salwak was downright fantastic!After the main show, I found myself in a close up gallery with David Parr who again, put on an awesome show. I don't know how they do it, but it's like nothing you have ever seen. I am extremely grateful for having the opportunity to attend and I would like to come back and bring some friends.Before I go, I have to point out the cluelessness of the hostesses/check in clerks. I bought my nephew a t-shirt and not only did they bring me one minus the shrink wrap, but it was dirty! Yes, it had dust on it and they both pretended as if they did not notice the dust until another patron who was thinking of buying the same t-shirt made a comment about it. She was also not impressed with them and decided not to purchase a single thing although she had several items in her hand.",4 star rating
327,9/10/2014,"This review was long overdue.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of magic, or the cheesiness that entails with the slip of the hand, abracadabra type entertainment, this place is fun and should be visited at least once.- First off, adults only, and there is a formal dress code.  Coat and tie, Dresses or formal pant suit.  Its outlined on their web site, and enforced.- Secondly, you must know someone to obtain a guest pass, or, be a member in the magician community.  My dad's coworker is a member, so that's how we got in.- Thirdly, they have valet parking.  The venue is located on top of a  steep hill. If you're going to get all dressed up, its a lot easier to just valet the car.  - Lastly, this place isn't cheap.  It's a private club, in a Big City.  You pay for parking, you pay for food, and you definitely pay for booze.  They have a restaurant if you wish to dine before the shows. The bonus for dining here is they can provide limited number of VIP tickets to one of the main shows.  A reservation to dine is required. Prices for dinner isn't cheap (think Morton Steakhouse prices) but the quality was excellent as was the service. Following dinner, we met up with my dad's friend who gave us a tour of the Castle, and did a private magic show for us.  In the Castle, there's multiple shows going on at once, almost like a carnival or circus.  In one room is one guy, down the hall is another performer, and so on.  There's one main show which has a ""headliner"" and that's where our VIP tickets came in handy. Unfortunately to keep the magician's tricks a secret.. no cameras or recording devices allowed inside.Its like visiting Club 33 if you're a Disney fan... a venue that every Angelino should add to their bucket list.",5 star rating

329,12/10/2017,"Ok my fellow yelping friends......why would anyone give The Magic Castle less than 5 stars?  Because it's not as good as other Magic Castles you've been to?  This is it.  There is only one Magic Castle.  If you want to see very high level magic done in an intimate atmosphere in a private club with very good food and very cool club like rooms and well made cocktails from several different bars with little wait in the middle of the Hollywood & Highland area with easy valet and controlled comfortable number of people inside, this is your place.  There are no others.I was able to get reservations for a Sunday brunch with my family, through a magician friend of mine who works there.  (No I can't hook you up, find your own magician friend.)  We got there nice and early, which I would strongly recommend, so you can see many shows.  I have no idea how many separate rooms there are, we went into three different ones prior to our buffet and main show.  Each room has it's own vibe, from underground NY village club to medieval dungeon. After entering the lobby and saying the magic password to gain entrance to the actual club, we were greeted by a hostess, who kept the flow of people heading to different shows in different rooms.  She was very friendly and really wanted to make sure everyone had seen as many shows as they could.  Our first one was a younger teenage magician.  It's very cool that the Magic Castle supports the craft of magic in this way, by giving younger magicians a venue to perform, and I'm sure they learn much from the older more experienced magicians.  From there we were whisked upstairs to a larger room with a magician with sleight of hand skills so impressive that it was clear I was watching a master perform.  And a reminder that this isn't just some kiddie venue.  With all the ""how you do it"" magic trick videos available to spoil the fun, sleight of hand will still blow you away every time.  More rooms and more shows from different magicians ensued.  I was very impressed with the diversity of the craft on display here.  Some magicians using physical props to amaze, others relying heavily on comedy and audience participation.  It's impossible to get bored here.  What I wasn't expecting was for the buffet brunch to be pretty darn good.  No it's not cheap, but I have no problem paying for quality, and I would return just for the food if this were a restaurant.  At most venues, where the main reason for being there is something else, the food is an afterthought.  But not here.  Made to order omelets, chilled seafood, a tasty prime rib carved to order, and even hot dishes in chafing dishes were well prepared.  The buffet was well attended to by staff and kept nice and fresh looking.  After brunch, we headed directly to the main show room, which featured 3 different magicians that we hadn't seen before.  It would be so easy for the Magic Castle to let magicians do the smaller shows, and then recycle them for the main act.  In the future I will definitely return, and I want to do one of their evening shows.  That's the great thing about The Magic Castle...every time you go, you'll get to see different magicians, so it's a completely different show every time.",5 star rating

332,1/27/2019,"I've been wanting to go to this place for a couple of years! Wow and it didn't disappoint.I went during Xmas time and loved seeing everything decorated- sooo much color.It was crowded and completely booked, I'm assuming that's probably how it is every Friday but overall I felt the staff does a very good job in managing such a large crowd.The food was delicious and although it was pricey I thought it was worth it. Overall we spent about $180 (it was 2 of us.) We had 2 beers (I thought the beer was priced very good, not a ridiculous price) 2 glasses of red wine, 2 salmon dinner plates + salad & baked potato dessert and appetizers. I get it when other reviews mention it can be pricey because you can have the same at half the cost somewhere else- however you don't get the awesome vibe. I totally feel you're paying for the great atmosphere and experience and would definitely recommend it. Plus who knows if I'll ever have the honor of getting a pass again.

333,5/26/2016,"We had a very special time from the moment we said the password to the owl for the doors to open and I already, can't wait to return. Growing up in LA most people have some sort of connection to someone who is a member here, I think that's just sort of how things work in this town. Think six degrees of separation but really it's not even that, you'd be surprised. I won't wish you luck getting in, because I'm sure you can find a way if you're resourceful enough.We've known a member or two for decades but I'd still never visited the Magic Castle until last night. I was super excited to attend as the guest of another friend/member we know. When visiting with a member our entry fee was waived, sweet! and we were not required to have dinner, although dinner would have been lovely - the time frame we were looking for was booked so we will return for the full dining experience in the near future.We did however order bar eats. The menu is quite large and everything was tasty after having drinks. It grew late and we missed ordering dessert before the kitchen closed but we did have Truffle Fries, Calamari, Sriracha Chicken, and Cheesy Garlic Bread earlier in the evening in between exploring and having drinks from various bars.Everyone is very friendly, talented and welcoming here. I met other members who loved to get you know you and were happy to extend their business cards ensuring you grow your network and know even more members so you aren't ever solely relying on only a few people to guarantee your entry. I also met and chatted with Milt Larsen at the bar, very sweet man!I loved the décor and touring the mansion. Irma seemed to be out of commission when we visited her but I did have the chance to entertain myself various other places, like the phone booth and sobriety checker. We had a chance to peek at the library, a classroom session being led by Mark Wilson and later his son Greg performing a show, the Houdini room and many other special areas here.There are restrooms everywhere, which our friend noted makes complete sense - since there are bars everywhere! Everything about the place is magical and special. Classy joint all the way :) Everyone must abide by the dress code so men, are dressed like true gentleman. Everyone is cleaned up and looking their best.Hostess take drink orders in all showrooms so if you missed grabbing one from a bar, need not fret you can wait in line for a show and still have a drink in hand by the time the fun starts.We did not attend the Palace show on our visit but we did attend 3 other shows in 2 other rooms. My favorite for the evening was one in the very intimate (although, every aspect of this place is intimate) Close Up theatre.Zero photography allowed inside, except for the lobby prior to entrance and very little if any cell phone reception inside - not that you'd want to waste even a second dealing with your phone. You will completely preoccupied during your visit.Although there are plenty of bar stools, tables and chairs do expect to be on your feet a lot, as you move about through the Magic Castle. Heels are always a great idea for ladies, but do wear comfortable ones. I can't wait to come back for dinner and another amazing experience. My boyfriend and Mom had a fabulous time and our friend managed to create many special miracles for us on his own, which added to our experience. I'm not certain attending without a member would be as much fun, until you've learned a lot about the place but on a first time visit being with a member to give you a proper tour and history of many things you wouldn't have otherwise learned is really a treat.This place really is special and I typically steer clear of saying certain places are for special occasions because you should find something special about every occasion so I'll say this place is perfect for any day, time of the week. It's an exceptionally different experience than dressing up and grabbing a drink or dinner anywhere else but I don't feel it should only be reserved for special occasions. Visit often as I'm sure you'll always enjoy something new here.",5 star rating

335,5/2/2017,"The Magic Castle has been on my ""whiteboard of things I need to attend"" for a long time and finally got to go down there! It was such a great experience - with 7-8 show rooms and every show room has a totally different experience. The rooms are divided into smaller (close up rooms) that seat 10-15 people, then you have larger show rooms which seat 50-75 people, and then table magic (which is 1-4 people). Every magician had such a different presentation style - from the history approach, to very audience focused, to movie magic, etc.The only improvement is the food - from what i've heard the food has improved but I wouldn't say it was that great - the gnocci tasted like plastic with not enough sauce - but I tried my gf's filet mignon and that was pretty good.The crazy part is there are 7-8 bars in the Castle to whichever corner you turn there is a cocktail waiting for you!Must visit, must see, highly recommend it!",5 star rating
336,11/4/2016,"A Magicians playground at it's finest! If you love magic, hell if you are even a little bit into it, this is a place you must experience. And that's exactly what it was, AN EXPERIENCE!  From paintings with eyeballs that follow you around the room, to tarot card readings, and pianos with ghosts, this place is truly one of a kind! Living in Vegas, I was lucky enough to befriend a local magician who invited my boyfriend and I to attend a Halloween Party that was taking place on my babe's 40th birthday. Considering we were already set on a Cali trip, this made it impossible to decline such a nice offer! Now usually The Magic Castle is a members only exclusive club. The only ways around that, are to have an invite from a member, or stay at the hotel next door. There are even ""members only"" nights, I can only imagine the cool stuff that takes place on those nights! The dress code is strict. Suite and tie, dresses, upscale only. However, for the night I attended, October 29th, is was a Day of the Dead theme costume party and it was mandatory you were in Halloween attire. My love and I decided to go all out and hired a make up artist to do our faces. With it being his birthday, going all out seemed totally appropriate. Upon arrival at the castle, I was indeed happy we decided to do such. Everyone looked amazing! I seen Beetlejuice, Bob Ross, men dressed as woman, a flurry of Day of the Dead style costumes. Everyone looked great, and I felt like I fit right in. You are allowed a photo outside, as well in the entry way of the castle only. Other than that, pictures and phone usage are not allowed. Personally, I felt that part was very gratifying. Being forced to interact and communicate and enjoy your surroundings. I instantly was annoyed the one time I noticed a patron taking a pic inside. I was good and did NOT take pics of the food. Hard to do! Drinks go for $14, and dinner for four, cost us $260 before a tip. The food was a solid 3.5. I won't say overpriced, because you are paying for the environment as much as anything. However, I expected a bit higher quality when it came to the meat and fish. Nothing was bad, but nothing was over the top amazing either. Granted, I am spoiled by quality food in LV. There are magic shows going on throughout the evening. We even had a show downstairs where it was only my group of friends. Super personal. Speaking of personal, I felt like my group was involved in every single show in one way or another. One guy bent a spoon in my hand, then gifted it to my bf for his birthday. Another magician made me a psychic, not sure how.  In one show they guessed my name, as well as a random fact about me. (that I love piglet from Winnie the Pooh). Oh and one guy told my boyfriend Happy Birthday, and not sure how he even knew! The waitresses will bring you food and drinks while in line too. Pretty awesome how accommodating they are. Basically follow the rules, spend a pretty penny, and get freaking spoiled the entire night! We were there from 6 PM to midnight, and still did not see everything. You do spend some of the evening in line. At one point I referred to the castle as the Disneyland for Magicians. Where you wait in line for magic shows instead of rides. But with alcohol. I highly recommend coming here if you ever have the chance. It's a special, excusive evening to be shared with ones you love.",5 star rating

339,1/6/2018,"I've been a frequent visitor to The Magic Castle for a while now.  This place is definitely an awesome treat to those who've been there or who's looking to go there for their first time!I've invited many first time visitors to come with me here and it's been nothing short of a spectacular experience.  I highly recommend making a dinner reservation and trying their Tomahawk Steak.  Although this place is not a steakhouse, they have one of the best Tomahawk Steak you will find in Los Angeles.  The service is always phenomenal as well.  Furthermore, a dinner reservation will get you a ticket to one of the two bigger magic shows.Dress to impress!  Guys, remember you have to wear a suit and keep your jacket on.  Ties or bow ties are absolutely required to gain entry.  I've brought guests that have forgotten a tie or bow tie in the past and they've let them borrow one as long as you put your driver's license as a deposit.  But do not rely on this method, just dress up!  Ladies must wear formal attire as well.  Always a fun night dressing up!There is only valet parking here so be aware of that.  You pay for the valet at the front desk when you enter. I do recommend coming here on a Friday or weekends if it's your first time here.  There are a few more rooms/shows open during those days compared to the weekdays.  The weekdays are definitely lighter on the crowds though.  All in all, be ready to spend 4-5 hours here if you want to check out all the rooms/shows and have dinner here.  Overall, this place is always a treat, great way to spend an evening here in Los Angeles.",5 star rating

There was alot of standing around and waiting (45 mins) for the next act to start. For the money, I was expecting a top notch,  or classy, or something amazing. But it was just average.

342,10/3/2016,"Invite only, this place is awesome and fancy. I won't lie, it's pretty pricey affair.Admission fee is $20-$30 depending on the day you go, non member valet price is $13, and dinner entrees are $30-50 dollars depending on what you get (excluding appetizers, sides, drinks, etc). Tickets for main show are provided after dinner. The garlic fries are a must, and my prime rib was tender but lacked flavor. Service was great though! The magic shows are legit. You can watch the small shows before and after the big main show. It's great how every magician has their own style and personality. I'm sad I didn't get to visit Irma, the invisible piano player, but there are lots of fun things to do around the castle. Dress code is classy, folks. No jeans and t-shirt. Ladies have to wear cocktail dress or pantsuit with a blazer, while guys have to wear suits. I would advise ladies to find a happy medium between clubbing clothes and prom dresses. Wear comfy (but still fancy) dress shoes because you're going to be walking a lot. Magic castle also has a no phone policy. No pictures inside the castle. They keep a close eye on these things so don't try to be sneaky! A manager even (kindly) talked to my party to keep the swearing down because it is not the place to do so.  Classy, not trashy! If you ever get an invite, don't pass it up! It's something you have to experience at least once.",4 star rating
343,1/5/2020,"I went last night for the first time and was excited due to all I've heard! After experiencing it, however, I would NOT recommend this place to a friend. It was SO crowded, chaotic and WAY too overpriced for the overall experience. Although I had read reviews, I did not expect the place to be so crowded. The food was not great and some of it was bad. Everyone at our table said their food was either ok or not good. One example: my lobster tail was so tough and difficult to cut through with a knife, not how lobster should be, very disappointing. The service was ok. I expected more when it came to the magic - it is called The Magic Castle afterall! Some performers were fantastic and deserve 5 stars. All were clearly talented and seem passionate about their craft which is why I'm giving this 2 stars and not 1 star. I realize the performance art of magic is not easy and takes years of practice, so I do appreciate that. The intimate, close-up performances were the best. I can think of so many better things to do with several hours and several hundred dollars.",2 star rating

346,3/22/2016,"Definitely  this is a place to visit in Hollywood, Los  Angeles. An historical landmark most likely built in the 1930s with its vintage mystiques that houses the modern day magicians. Do come, and you will not be disappointed. No picture taking is allowed in the castle, except at the front entrance lobby. With the correct verbal password of ""open sesame!"", the bookshelves opens up,  and welcomes you into the Magic Castle. While walking in, it feels like a dream.  A dream of taking us back to the Post Depression era of 1930s. The life of partying, drinking, gambling, and of course wizardry. You'll see bars, tables, and magicians performing  for smaller audiences who might be relaxing at the bar, or is waiting for a main show in one of the magic theatres. The Castle has a variety of shows to watch throughout the day. They have a main theatre which can seat approximately 100 people, then a medium theatre for about 60 people,  and the up close room for maybe 25 people.  These shows run all day and it's usually packed. People who dine in the Magic Castle is guaranteed a seat with a ticket. Others are lined up as stand by for the remaining seats available. Really, it doesn't matter which magic show,  they're all very entertaining with excellent magicians.  You may watch as close as you can,  or analyze as much as you want, in most cases you can't figure out the trick because the magicians are that good! Getting into the Magic Castle is tough. If you're not a member,  or do not personally know a magician, then the wait from what I hear from others is about a month, depends how busy they get. I was very fortunate to have a friend who's a member. We could get in the same day. The food there I guess it's okay. I've only eaten there once,  and it was a while ago. I had a steak that I recalled was just okay.  But from me talking to others the last time I went, the food was to be delicious. They must have come a long way with their quality. So I plan to eat there again soon... instead of just drink.  LOL. The drinks are good though! The bartenders knows their stuff, cheers!Valet parking is $13. No choice for that part. It's worth it because you're in crazy Hollywood. And it's much more convenient. Definitely a five stars experience with the magicians alone!  Great talent with godly skills. If you're visiting LA, it's a must.",5 star rating
347,2/14/2019,"I'll start this by saying I fully support, admire and love performance art, magicians and all that take their time honing their craft.  I love going to magic shows, but the best thing about The Magic Castle is the illusion that you'll enjoy yourself.First, the environment.We chose to go on a weeknight because we heard the weekends were busy.  I can't imagine how much busier or packed it could have been because it's claustrophobic at best.  It may be ""invite only"", but it seems anyone and everyone can get a guest pass.  So. Many. People.  You spend the majority of your time standing in line, which drains any excitement to see performers.  Once you actually get into a show, it's short, packed in and before you know it you're ushered out.  After you exit, it's trying to find a show that doesn't have a line and/or isn't already at capacity.  Maybe this is part of the mystique?I read another review that said something along the lines of this place keeps the cocktail dress section of Ross Dress for Less in business.  Pretty spot on.Cost.Wowza.  $15 valet plus a tip (tip these guys, they work hard and are very nice), $25 entrance, dinner $50-75/pp, drinks $14 average.  At minimum you're looking at at least a $120 night per person and that's only with a couple drinks for the whole night.Service.Valet guys were great.  Check-in staff were very nice and welcoming.  Bartenders were pretty good, but seemed to get pretty bogged down.  Service in the restaurant was efficient and friendly.Food.Meh.  It's just ok.  I'd expect higher quality for the cost, but I didn't go in expecting Michelin star food.  I had the vegan option which was a disappointing plate of oddly flavored mushrooms and some fried tofu.  I love mushrooms and couldn't eat more than a third of the plate.  The steaks at the table looked great and the desserts were on point.The not taking pictures thing...I totally get it, I hate seeing life through a lens!  Rather than pointing people out because they either forgot, didn't listen closely to the rules, got excited and took a picture, etc... Hey MC just get some of those lock bags for people so they aren't even tempted or tell people to leave their phones in the car.  Saw two different people get straight up scolded for taking a picture, in a hallway, by three men, loudly.  Excessive.  Read the other reviews and  Geez...if you go, for the love of all the gods, whatever you do don't take a f'n picture because they are insane about it and apparently the sky will fall.In the end we only saw two short shows, had a mediocre expensive dinner and left less than impressed with the experience.  There are other places to see and support the performers in Los Angeles and I recommend checking those places out.  If you want to go spend the $250 for a couple, go have a nice meal at an actual restaurant or have a $100 meal and pay to see these performers elsewhere.I'm aware Magic Castle doesn't care about their reviews (good on them), but I'm trying to save the readers of this some money and irritation.  Find yourself a magic show elsewhere, there are plenty.Thanks but no thanks.  Everyone needs to stop thinking the Magic Castle is magical but it is the best trick ever.",3 star rating
348,6/23/2017,"What an impressive venue! The exclusivity of it makes it even more alluring. They don't allow you to take any photos which is great because you don't have a bunch of hands with phones in the air trying to take a video of the magic show. Location: This place is neatly tucked away in the midst of Hollywood and I feel like I've driven by it without realizing. The reason for a dock in star is the food. Although the food was good, it was not worth the price we paid. The beef Wellington was cooked well but nothing my taste buds would remember. I'll leave my review at that and won't divulge too much as it is certainly a place to experience. Tips: Take the tour to experience everything. Be prepared to stay till 2 because there are lots of little shows. The champagne cocktail is delicious.",4 star rating
349,9/29/2019,"Garbage establishment starting from the phone call to make a reservation. Took over 20+ mins on hold then the women says they get booked 6 months in advance but some how ""magically"" they have a cancellation for your exact date and number of people. Made it clear that if you dont show up they charge you regardless on the card that you have to give to make the reservation so you have no choice but to go. Once there theres a cover charge to get in plus valet and then your in a small building with a few small bars and a couple shows that you'd expect to see in a circus with balloons and mind readers. Now here's the best part. Your required to eat 1 entree per person at dinner. I like to assume if you get the chef's special which is usually the most expensive thing they have off the menu it should be good right? Especially a place with such a strict dress code and high prices. But sadly no you get a tomahawk steak hard as a rock and it so dry that you need to drink their club soda that they put in fancy glass bottles to make it look better then what it is. Ive fed my dog better meat then this and I'm not even joking when i say that. You want to see a good magic show and have amazing food dont come here because you'll leave angry and disappointed just like me.  0/5",1 star rating

351,12/25/2019,"The food was good. I recommend the beef Wellington. It was cooked perfectly. My husbands steak was a little over cooked. The burgers at the bar was surprisingly good. The shows could be a little better. This place is over booked. It's like going to Disneyland with the annoying rude people. While in line, people were pushing and cutting. Some girls took off their heels and walked around barefoot. It's tacky. Surprised the establishment didn't say anything. All and all we spent close to $500 for two on food, drinks, and entry fee.",4 star rating

353,1/2/2018,"I was able to score an invite to The Magic Castle earlier this year, and over the weekend we finally went with some friends. - Reservations - They book up pretty far in advance. I called in September to make reservations and the first weekend dinner I was able to book was end of December, so make sure to plan it as soon as you can.- Dress code is very strict, everybody must dress to the nines, we actually saw people get turned away when we were entering.- Valet parking is $13, and cover charge at night is $30 per person.- Dinner is required, and dinner is not cheap. It was about $230 per couple, although we did get soups/salads and desserts. I would figure at least $75 a person for dinner. - There are a few bars throughout the castle, and there are waitresses walking around to get drink orders while you stand in line and in the rooms before the shows start. If you want to drink, it's very easy to get a drink, and the prices of the drinks are average. - You can show up before your reservation time, which is good to know. We were able to catch two magic shows before dinner, and two after. Timing is everything here. We lucked out and talked to a very nice man who worked there and helped us plan out an itinerary for our visit, even down to where to sit in each theater to allow us easy access to the exits to be able to make it to the next show in time and get good seating. - There is a LOT of standing, walking, and staircases to deal with, so wear comfortable shoes! My friend had been before and he told me it was a lot of sitting. WRONG. I was miserable in the shoes I wore, so definitely keep that in mind. Some shows you need to stand in line for up to an hour, some shows are standing only. Dinner was good, much better than any of expected it would be. I had their Thai Curry Crab soup and that was amazing! For dinner I had the sea bass, which was pretty good, the fish itself was slightly under-seasoned, but the miso broth and vegetables served with it were very tasty. My husband had Tuna Tartare that was excellent, and his Beef Wellington was great. We all shared the Mac & Cheese, which was pretty bland, and the Brussels Sprouts that were overcooked and too sweet. Our friends each had different steaks and they enjoyed them. For dessert the four of us spilt the Banana Cream Pie, absolutely delicious, and the Warm Chocolate Cake that wasn't anything remarkable.  The magic shows were entertaining. Lots of card tricks and sleight of hand magic. Some were better than others, I was bummed because we left before our friends, and they caught another show after that was a Mentalist that they said blew their minds. I wish we had stuck around for that. Overall it was a fun, unique, evening. I don't necessarily need to go back, but my husband says he definitely wants to. If I can find a way to get another invite I will go again.",4 star rating

355,3/3/2016,"I came here on an invite from one of my buddies. One of his patients was a magician here, and he was given an invite. He called me up, and being the extreme extrovert that I am, I couldn't say no.Driving into this place, I remembered driving by this place many times when I was on my way to party on Hollywood Blvd. I had a buddy who lived in Hollywood Hills, and I would traverse this part of town often. So I was intrigued on the idea of finally venturing into this place.We pulled up, and valet took care of us. After checking our IDs and invitations, we went through a door that opens up when you say a specific command. Interesting.We walked into one of many bar areas. The decor was very interesting: very turn of the century. We ordered our drinks, and were attended to by a cool bartender. Alex Figueroa is his name, and he had interesting magic tricks of his own. From him, we learned an interesting puzzle involving bar picks. To any fellow Yelper that meets me in person, I will tell you all about it.We then proceeded to the magic show. We went to the other side of the castle, where our host greeted us. An open bar and finger foods kept the conversations going. It was a singles event, and everyone was mingling with everyone. I did a good deal of networking as well.The actual magic show was awesome. The magician had a good personality, and involved the crowd. Everyone was having a good time. After the show, everyone went to another part of the castle, where another magic show was going on. That magician was also pretty good. Much like the first, he had a good sense of humor and had entertaining tricks.My buddy and I called it quits around 11, since it was a weekday night. But I thoroughly enjoyed my time here, and I will be back to check out more events.",5 star rating
356,3/2/2018,The Magic Castle is one of my favorite places to visit. Though it is very exclusive and you have to be a member or invited to attend. Also you must be 21+ unless on Sundays for brunch and the dress code is cocktail/formal. I've had the honor to visit a few times and I have always had a really fun filled time while leaving in awe from all the shows. The food is fantastic and the ambiance is so friendly. Walking around the castle it's great to learn about the history and there is so much to look at. No matter how many times you come there are always new magicians to meet and new acts to see. The best part are the small intimate parlors where you get to sit up close and get involved with the magic tricks. If you are ever privileged enough to attend you are in for a magical unforgettable night.,5 star rating
357,7/21/2018,"Show-My review goes out to the female performer that never spoke a word and amazed our group with her juggling talent. Her last act was so musical and left everyone in such a good place. I loved every minute of her performance and we wish her nothing but great success. Food-We waited 50 minutes to get our soup and salads. Then after that another 20 minutes for the food to come. We also got our garlic bread half way through dinner. I always thought the bread came first. Greens were bitter and didn't taste good at all. Bitter, bitter, bitter. Cast iron chicken was ok. No visible seasoning. Just looked like it was deep fried by itself.  Butternut squash was 1/4 cooked and the rest raw. For it being one of the  lower priced entrees at $39 bucks, I could turn out a better dinner making it myself. True story. No complaints about the soup, that was good. However the soup was served on a flat plate. That tells you the amount you actually got to eat. A thin layer of sour on a plate. Literally. 5 spoonfuls and done. Great pics and  Memorabilia. Women's attire should be more enforced. All men have to wear a suit, then women should be in a nice dress. Some chicks were in summer skank wear with a jacket to cover the tacky outfit. Really? Some ladies, hats off. Your were looking great. Valet was fastThe star of the night was the female magician who can juggle. We loved loved loved her. Give that bitch a raise!!!!!",4 star rating
358,5/24/2016,"This is for the restaurant and facility, not the magicians. I am not a member and appreciate the opportunity to goFirst, to get in the door, with a reservation, the bouncer needed to see the original invitation on my phone, not the confirmation... no idea why, the check in girl didn't care about any of that, my name was on the list. Also, the bouncer required IDs to get in the door, I don't care because it was in my name and figured it was for that. My wife could not find hers and we were about to be turned away. If that is for alcohol, open your fucking eyes, we don't look under 40, and there is no way anyone would mistake us for teenagers. I get annoyed with this shit, the last time a bouncer wanted to ID me I pretty much told him to go F* himself and walked in. Pay the $30 person cover and $13 parking. So then we use the restroom before going on our adventure. There are dangerous stairs just inside the mens room, so exercise caution. We go up stairs and are seated at a tiny table. The waiter, Michael, comes by and and I ask for recommendation, first he recommends the lamb, I'm not a fan of lamb so ask what next, he suggests the Sea Bass. I take it. we order Spinach dip appetizer and I a soup, her a salad. moments later the soup and salad are delivered along with bread and the table is now about full. I figured he didn't write down the appetizer and we were just skipping forward. Then one bite into the Soup and Salad another runner shows up with the appetizer and forces it onto the table. I was about to send it back because I don't play that game. So we eat finish everything on the table and then it is like 30 minutes for entrees to arrive. I am not thrilled in the least with the Sea Bass, but her Diver Scallops were really good. So dessert time, we went with the Banana pie, it was ok, assembled oddly and pretty much fell apart. My wife loves banana creme pie, she was disappointed as was I. I guess this fall in the category of captive audience, everyone wants to go to the Magic Castle, so they can serve mediocre food at higher than market prices because the demand is so high. For the facility, it is an annoying place, there are 7-8 sets of stairs to traverse, and constantly ascending and descending to get to the different rooms/theaters. Most of the rooms are very small and packed, which I guess is good because the place is overcrowded, there were shows we did not get do see because we arrived at 9 for the 9:15 show and they already had the closed the line for the 10:00 show and we didn't feel like standing there 2 hours for the 10:45 show. Felt a lot like ComicCon with hours long lines... Oh for one of the shows we did sit and wait an hour, because there were chairs outside the Peller. When it came time to let us in, good thing we were first, because there were 27 VIPs for a room of 40, so most people waiting didn't get in. Annoying in the Peller, we were seated on the side, in the aisle, and after everyone was seated and the show had started they decided to turn on the blinding LED step lights. Annoying me through the entire show. In the main theater, the seats are not staggered like most theaters, so you are constantly shifting to try and see around the person or people in front of you's heads. The atmosphere is loud in most of the club, so it can be difficult to hear the magicians. In the early 1990's I managed a Comedy Club and every time a magician came through they gave me invited to the Magic Castle, and for 26 years I have wanted to go... I'm glad I did, but definitely not planning to ever go again. Oh, and final total for 2, no alcohol, $250Oh, and if you want to go, and don't know anyone to invite you, book a stay at the Magic Castle hotel and it includes your $30/person admission.Oh, and one more thing, the Houdini Aquarium form Tanked is no longer there, the manager told us that Houdini decomposed and killed all of the fish, so the got rid of it.",2 star rating

362,11/22/2017,"I have been here three times now after last night.This is an exclusive club for magicians to practice and perform.  It's got such a glamour to it for a few reasons. One, it's atop a hill at the base of the Hollywood Hills and just LOOKS magical.  Two, you're required to dress to the nines, dresses (or if pants, a dress jacket is required) for the ladies and suit for gentlemen. Three, the restaurant has really great food.  It's expensive but worth it, in my opinion.  Four, the cocktails are great and there are bars EVERYWHERE. Five, no photos allowed inside and this is really important because they want to keep it feeling exclusive. Six, the MAGIC!  So impressive.You have to be invited by or walked in by a magician to go.  Once invited, you must make dinner reservations (unless you're just walked in by a member/magician).  Now, if you have dinner you have to pay $30 at the door (or it might be $20, I don't recall).  If you decide to skip dinner, it's $50.  One tip is that you don't have to show up right at your dinner reservation, you can come anytime after 5pm the day of your reso.It's best to get a program of performances for reference during the night.  Ask the bartender or a roving magician where the best magicians are performing and don't be afraid to wait in line for the next show for the best ones!They offer brunch shows/resos as well but they're more aimed toward kids.  I learned this the hard way when I took a bunch of friends there and expected the night time experience and it was definitely different.  It wasn't bad but not as impressive and the coordinator was so accommodating by making sure we could come back a later date for a nighttime experience.The staff here are all very friendly and I'll keep going at every opportunity!",5 star rating

364,8/21/2018,"What a fantastic experience! I went for my first time last month and am looking for another ticket to go again!I originally got my invite through a magician, and was so stoked as I had always heard about this place but never got the chance to visit. I invited 4 of my closest girlfriends and we had a blast! I phoned in about a month or 2 in advance in order to reserve for Friday night, and I got a later slot for dinner (around 10 pm) with tickets for a show at 11 pm. Each guest has to pay $35 for entrance along with dinner.To get to the castle, we experienced quite a bit of traffic on the block of, going up the hill to get to the valet. It's a steep hill to get to the castle, too. Once our party all arrived we waited in a short line to take a picture in front of the backdrop, then we were let in when the bouncer/security checked my ticket. Once we go in, we paid the $35 entrance fee at the front desk and confirmed dinner reservations.The rest of the experience I will leave as a magical mystery, since I believe this is a place that should be experienced fully presently! However, I will say that the entire experience is a combination of comedy, magic, and social classiness! I had so much fun not only watching, but partaking in the magic! Watch closely!The food and drinks were also really great, and at the end of the experience we are brought back to a merchandise booth area where we could buy some souvenirs from the night!Overall a magical experience, and would definitely return if invited!",5 star rating

My date ordered the beef dish and it was decent too. I also ordered an old fashion and it tasted like shit.Now on to the magic. For reference we had an 8pm showing on a Sunday night. The main performance was hilarious.. it was more comedy than magic, but very entertaining nonetheless.  The smaller side shows were decent, but only a few acts and magic tricks really stood out to me. Most of them I have seen already. Overall the experience was fun and entertaining.

366,3/24/2018,"Get there early to see everything. Allow at least 5 hrs including dinner.  castle (mansion) is fun if you like magic, you like drinking, you like dressing up and you have money. Having been to the castle several times I can share that you don't need to stay at the castle hotel to get tickets to the castle. All you have to do is contact a castle member magician (there are hundreds and they are listed on the castle website.) they ALL get unlimited (paid) tickets. You can reach them on their website or social media. Or just reach out to any pro magician in south California.Go to the website and look at the now_appearingPage.You'll have to buy dinner and maybe pay an admission cover charge with most of the tickets. With the better tickets you don't have to buy dinner. The castle makes their money from these charges so they make admission easy to get.If you get on the VIP guest list or are met there by the member you don't have to pay anything.The meals and drinks are pricey and they push the drinks HARD. There are about 6 separate bars. They claim you can't take photos. Please take them and post them on yelp!The rooms are small so you need to queue up and use the entry tickets you get with dinner.",3 star rating
367,2/2/2016,"My other 2 reviews have been deleted by Yelp. Why?  Funny story. I noticed that this certain Elite Yelper had suddenly gone from 0 check-ins to over 40 check-ins in about a month. I'd never seen her there even though she supposedly checked in on dates I was there, and yet she hadn't posted any pictures of the lobby or outside area where pictures are allowed (nay, encouraged) and never even written a review. Also she lists she takes photos all over LA yet not a single photo of the Castle.  Doesn't take a genius to figure out she was just randomly checking in and probably lived or worked close by.  So I messaged her and asked what was up, and she sent back this rude response that she could check in because she did go often, she liked to jog up the hill and that she had actually been there before (???).  She then blocked me and flagged my reviews and claimed I worked for the Magic Castle, which I do not.  Now at least I see why she's a regular at 88 other places...So anyway, I'm a member at the Castle but do not work here.  Much like if I was a member at a gym, a Costco or yoga place that require memberships to go.  Most of the public stuff about the castle such as dress code, no photos inside policy, the food quality/costs, and bars have all been covered extensively by other Yelpers. So I probably wouldn't add much more to what's already been stated.  What I will say, however, is that this is at its core a private membership club for magicians and lovers of magic, and a lot of people forget about that.  So they complain that it's so hard to get in (which is part of the ambiance) and set the bar up pretty high and then are disappointed for whatever reason.  But guests should know that featured magicians change every week, with about 7-10 different magicians a week so everyone's experience will be slightly different based on the shows they see.  Keep in mind also that some weeks are better than others because there will be different magicians performing different magic week to week so it's hard to compare experiences.The best thing to do upon entering is to find a member (magician members will have gold owls on their lapel) and ask which magician they'd recommend that night or if there are any must sees that evening.  Most members will be glad to help and steer you in the right direction. There are also extra magicians who come Thu-Sun because of the weekend crowds and they need more magic at the club.  On those days make sure to go down to the Hat & Hare Bar to see Mike Pisciotta, who is a definite must see.  Also there's an early early close up room magician, the Peller Theater is open (with 2 magicians), and a WC Fields Bar magician.  Feel free to ask those gold owl wearing magician members for a trick or two also. That's like the only time I carry cards with me just for that reason.Finally, getting a pass is becoming more difficult, as our policy is to hand passes out to only people we know. We're ultimately responsible for our guests so handing out passes to strangers (passes can be traced back to us) who then get belligerent can get us in trouble. You can look up who's performing and email the performers, but be aware that we share a common Members Facebook page and have a laugh at that too.  Good luck!",5 star rating
368,10/29/2017,"After waiting for you 10 months I finally got an opportunity to use my ""magician invited guest pass"". Only catch was that it was Halloween weekend and we had to be in costume. The friendly lady on the phone told me that we ""must be in obvious costume"". Our reservation was confirmed at 11am and dinner was at 9:30pm.So my Girlfriend and I along with her out of state cousin went costume shopping on the day. 2 hours and $400 later we had matching pirates costumes and our cousin was a lady bug. We also managed to get another friend confined who came as cleopatra. Oddest crew out there but we were really excited for a fun night.Now, the check in process was long and tedious. Upon getting seated I wasn't sure if the missing waitress was part of the act because she was constantly missing. Finally she took our order and our below average food arrived. They even stuffed up our mac and cheese. Our waitress was rude and passive aggressive when taking our order and then when handing our tickets to us for the after dinner show. Our bill for a party of four was $450 including tip when we had only a few drinks and two in our group only has salad entrees. Let me just say that this poor service and mediocre meal was the highlight of the night. We seated ourselves in the small theatre for an evening of magic and I have to say we all witnessed the most retarded ""magic show"" we had ever seen. I have seen better entertainment by Ronald McDonald at my brothers 4th birthday. This show wasn't even funny, there was no magic and for 20 minutes a young kid performer had an act of flipping 5 spoons into a cup, something a 6 year old could do. On top of this, we weren't even allowed to leave. I really wish I could unsee this show as it's traumatized me for life. I myself am an amateur magician and let me just say that I could have done a better job with a deck of cards. Oh, and don't try to take a selfie in the theatre.. I tried to take one with my GF and a waitress jumped out of thin air and grabbed me and then demanded I delete the picture.Avoid this place at all costs. Not worth the exclusive members only status.",1 star rating

370,4/12/2018,Always a great time at the castle! Great magicians and fun food & drinks. Make sure you take time to sit with Irma. Also ask around for a tour to hear about the history and cool parts of the castle. I've been a bunch of times with my bf who is a magician and it's so great to see elite magicians. It's a great clubhouse for magicians but also great place for non magicians to go and hang for the night. Food is a little costly so be prepared for that. Same with drinks. Staff is super friendly and informative.,5 star rating

They should make that clear - really bad business practice.",1 star rating
373,2/10/2016,"Los Angeles is home to many hidden gems, but if you're looking for a magical evening unique to the area The Magic Castle is certainly a venue that will impress. I had the opportunity to visit on three occasions and the performances never cease to excite me. However, as an exclusive and private club, guests need to have an invitation from a current member. In essence if you're extended an invitation you definitely need to go :)   The venue itself is situated atop a mountain in Hollywood and the interior has a vintage old Hollywood glamour feel to it. The decorations are very art deco and while the space is quite intimate, guests have the option to get up close and personal to some of the world's best magicians. It is a bit of a maze inside, but everyone is really kind and courteous in directing guests to the shows. If you're a first timer I recommend sitting in the front row as the magicians are likely to select volunteers in participating in the act.Overall it's a wonderful get-away to get all dolled up and enjoy great entertainment.",5 star rating
374,11/10/2017,"Someone needs to re-think their business strategy here. $60 for two double Tito's and soda? Ok don't get me wrong it would have totally been cool if the food was semi decent and our waiter Richard didn't completely set the tone for the evening with dinner and ruin our night and make the entire evening awkward. But when you charge outrageous prices for cocktails and food, you better make sure that the quality is at least somewhat decent. Serving 101: Don't greet your table with Hi I'm Richard and I'm tired so my bus guy here is going to do my job and not get paid as much as me to do so.   No one cares if you're tired. If you don't feel like working, go home. I'm sure there's someone out there that would love to have your job.WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT GET THE RISOTTO....it's flavorless and had the mushy consistency of baby food. ALSO the $75 lobster tail they are serving tastes like rubber. I enjoyed my night with my friends, but The Magic Castle doesn't live up to its name or reputation. They should probably consider a name change to the mediocre inn or something.",1 star rating
375,9/26/2016,"Everything about this place is amazing! From the secret password to enter to all of the magical surprises that await you inside. You must be a member/know a member to get in, and a dinner reservation is a must! Luckily the food is amazing and completes your experience anyways!You can't beat all of the history that awaits you once you pass the little owl in the lobby.  Walking around its like you are transformed into a magical world. Be sure to visit Irma while enjoying a few tasty drinks at the bar. In terms of the shows, the up close magic show is always a MUST! Im telling you the performers are really quite remarkable.  Be sure to arrive early/check out their website to plan out the shows perfectly so you can see all of the performers for the evening. They change performers weekly. Luckily you get tickets to the main show with a dinner reservation so no need to worry about missing that one.All of the workers are extremely nice, animated, and accommodating. Service is top notch. And all of the food is delicious! I definitely recommend getting an order of their cheesy bread to start.  In terms of their entrees, their prime rib is mouthwatering!Be sure to visit the little green table next to the bar by the main room, members of the castle are usually their performing fun cards tricks while you wait for a show or sip on your cocktail.

I luckily am friends with a member who gives me invites. I think there are different types of invitations, regardless we paid an entrance fee. Parking is valet-only at $10 bucks (thats the cheapest part of the night). Feel free to walk around the venue and find cool little magic acts, THE LOBBY IS YOUR LAST SPOT FOR YOUR INSTAGRAM PHOTO OPPORTUNITY.If I am not mistaken unless you know someone, you usually have to have dinner as part of the visit. Dinner is cheap, nothing crazy at all - 50$ for the most expensive thing, all plates are combos - I thought they were all generous portions. Again, don't come here expecting Mastros or The Palm LA - cause this just ain't it (still decent tho).After dinner, you get your ticket(s) to the main show, I think its first come, first serve (there will be a time for your show) but in the mean time you're free to roam the place and trip the F**K OUT... the bar is amazing. I got so hammered and had so much fun. I will never forget any experience I have at the Magic Castle.Do yourself a favor AND COME EARLY, schedule your dinner early, see a great show and wander like crazy.

379,12/5/2017,"I'm not one to enjoy magic, never really saw the appeal even as a child. Therefore going to the magic castle for me was much more about enjoying be food and drinks than to watch the actual shows. So this review is for the food and the very stiff drinks rather than the show. With that being said the decor and ambiance of the magic castle was truly flawless. As you make your way to the different shows you truly feel like you are in a magic castle. As you watch the shows the waitress comes around and gets your drink order. You will not be disappointed as every drink that we ordered was stiffer than the next, happy to say. 5/5 stars to our amazing waitress. The restaurant was 4/5, I don't eat meat anymore so I cannot comment to the steak but from others in our party that did eat the steak they gave it a 4/5. The sides and vegetarian dishes were great. They had a cauliflower soup that night as a special which was amazing. Service was impeccable and ambiance a 5/5. Overall a great experience.

They have a few different bars where you can grab a drink and it's pretty standard pricing. Definitely a fun night out!,5 star rating
382,1/4/2016,I was finally able to make it here thanks to a friend. I usually don't get excited for an event but this made it more fun since you have to be an invited guest to attend. There are lot of magic activities to see around the Castle. From magicians performing in front of you at tables to shows in a small theater. I came on a Sunday night but it might be better on a Friday or Saturday because the shows can end late. You can walk around the Castle and view the decor or hang out at the bars.Dress code: strictly enforced so check the website.                      Guys: dress in slacks and jacket at least. Women: DressParking: Valet onlyEntrance Fee: $30 per guest. Food & Drinks Separate.Dinner: Classic American Cuisine. The food was decent and not much to rave about but its a decent meal.

This place is a house full of tricks and treats. Once you enter you instantly walk into a different environment, one that is reminiscent of a time period where magicians like Houdini roamed. the house itself has an endless feel full of doors, hallways and different rooms you can visit and hopefully catch a magician as he or she begins their act. The magic castle is , well, Full of Magic. You really get to see it all but as per rule and preservation of the secrets inside, i shouldn't say any more.

Everything was very pricy for what you got. Very very rude staff, (upstairs) the downstairs staff that checked us in (blond young girl) didn't get her name was very nice and sweet. Now back to upstairs where we sat down for dinner, so instead of asking nicely since we r all humans and normally we speak to another human not yell, this tall man came and yelled at us and said I am not telling u again. 1st of all who u think u r talking to? 2nd of all you never said anything to us before u A$$. He claimed we were taking pictures of the place. But we took a picture of our plate. We Didn't get his name didn't even have a name tag on.  Tall man wearing all black. Well anyways after waiting around and our reservation the time even passed a little, finally our table was ready to go. Our waiter was very nice but very slow. Took a while to get our drinks and even took a while to get his attention to order additional items or get a napkin. The show was very quick (45 mins which was the longest show they offered) passed quickly he only did about 6-8 magic tricks, and that was that.

I definitely recommend that you see Hannibal if he's performing on the day you visit. After having a deck of cards cut about 10 times by different audience members, he was able to recite the cards in order from top to bottom. Everyone in the audience was highly impressed. The close up shows are excellent as well. Just be sure to line up as early as possible to guarantee a chair, otherwise you may have to stand. The main show was very entertaining too.

My girlfriend's friend had an extra ticket and I was lucky enough to be invited to come along to finally see what the Magic Castle was all about. We arrived a little earlier than the agreed upon time to meet up for dinner and was able to explore the castle a bit before dinner time. When you walk in, check your car in valet (since that's the only option), pay for your entrance fee at the door & pay for your parking fee as well before you're allowed to enter through the secret doorway into the fun, mysterious and exciting world of magic. But before you do that; make sure you walk a little to your left hand side after entering to check out their Magic Gift Shop.There are absolutely NO pictures that can be taken and any photos should be taken outside before entering through the magic door. Once you enter through the doors, it's like you're transformed into another world. Overall: Dinner was great and we thoroughly enjoyed our food. My girlfriend's food came out a bit cold and they offered to give her a new plate after she explained to them what happened. We shared our dessert of macarons (which were just okay though). After that we walked to the auditorium where we got to see our Magic Show and then explore the remainder of the Castle afterwards (and take part in one of the Magic shows in one of the Magic rooms!)Before taking off for the night, don't forget to take an obligatory photo op in front of the Magic Castle banner outside!",5 star rating

398,10/28/2015,"In the words of Toto, our favorite magician of the night, aMAAAAAAAzing!The Magic Castle is one of my favorite places to celebrate a special occasion. It's exclusive and swank without too much pretense, and now that they've revamped the restaurant, the food is up to par (standard steakhouse fare).The aura of the castle is enigmatic and moody with a flair of Old Hollywood. It is huge, and I would strongly consider exploring the castle before committing to sitting down for a show. Yes, go down the dark, mysterious staircase, it probably leads to a hidden bar, or secret show room. I've been here several times, and the best shows are almost always the impromptu performances at the bars downstairs.There is a $30 cover to get in if you're not VIP. Yes, it's by invite only, and you have to know someone who knows someone to get in. Drinks are standard for an establishment of this repute (about $15 for a cocktail) and dinner is about $50-$75 per person. The beef wellington is my go to dish, unless they have a lobster special.My favorite shows have always been the close-up performances and the impromptu bar magic. The ""big shows"" are entertaining, but I've never been too impressed. The close-up magic is mind blowing and worth waiting for.Fun fact: Magic Castle helped inspire some of the illusions in the magic. There is an animatronic and a plaque from the original Haunted Mansion ride in the downstairs ""Haunted Hallway"" of the castle.",5 star rating

Anyways...After taking your pictures, you pay your very reasonable entry fee of $20 per person and you're in. Nice. D I N N E RI went all out on this dinner. Pretended money wasn't a problem for me. Ordered the calamari, a bowl of their ""famous"" chili, their special orange marg, a glass of Riesling, and the rack of lamb. With tax and tip I think it all came out to around $110-$120. A decent chunk of change but nothing seemed unreasonably priced. The calamari was good but nothing special. Same goes for the ""famous"" chili - good but nothing special. I was loving the orange marg. Thought it was gonna be too sweet but it was perfect. Ended up ordering 3 or 4 of these throughout the night. The riesling was excellent. And I loved the rack of lamb. Cooked to a perfect medium rare and it had a super good flavor. Pretty good size as well. The lamb came with garlic mashed potatoes which were nice, different colored carrots which were undercooked, and broccolini which was fine.

400,2/26/2016,"My sister got invited and brought my husband and I and my parents along as her guests since it has been a life long dream of my moms to go. You arrive and have your car valeted and wait to be verified from the list. While you wait they had some heaters going and a cute little back drop for pictures since no pictures are allowed inside. I loved the dress code and the fact that cell phones are not allowed (even though a lot of people do not follow this...) It makes for a great evening where you can enjoy the company of others you are with. We arrived when they opened for our 9:30 pm dinner reservation and we still did not get to see everything. You arrive at the main bar, where we ordered a round of drinks and got a tab started since we planned on being there all night. While here we were able to ask someone with a name tag where we should go and what we should do since we were so early. They were very nice and super helpful for recommendations. You really do have to wander around and make your own adventure. The castle is amazing and always has something new. Some of our favorite things were the smaller acts. Even just waiting in line for shows can be an experience as we had the chance to chat with quite a few members who were funny and super nice. We arrived early for our dinner reservation because we did not have enough time to do anything else and luckily they seated us early. We started with the garlic cheese bread which was delicious and hit the spot. Most of our party had the prime rib and my husband had the beef wellington. All the food was quite delicious and on par for what I would expect. Let's be honest, you aren't coming to The Magic Castle for the food. We received our big show tickets with dinner and had enough time to get in line to get a great seat. They constantly have cocktail waitresses circulating through the theaters before shows which is really nice. All of the shows were absolutely amazing but again some of my favorite acts were the smaller ones. Come with an open mind and an adventurous spirit and you will be sure to have a good time!",5 star rating
401,3/25/2016,"This is such a fun place to go. If you are a magic fan, you must visit this place at least once in your life. You have to dress up to go to this venue. Females in their cocktail dress and males in suit and tie. You get the exclusive and high end type of feel that is hard to find these days. The castle itself is a maze. They have multiple show rooms and be prepared to line up (sometimes hours before a show). The floors are all carpeted, so it might be hard for females to walk but it provides cushion on the feet. The seats just got an upgrade as well. Everyone must, and I mean MUST go to the Palace show. This is where the main show is for the night. This is the largest room with the largest stage. Be prepared to be called upon stage. They usually have 3-4 performers doing 40 minutes of magic. People who have dinner at the castle get priority into the show, while there is a short stand by line. The other places in the castle are mostly impromptu shows. They are close up magic at its best. Fridays, Saturdays are the busiest. But that should not stop you. That just means there is more performances. They do provide valet service. However, if they are full, be prepared to park in Highland or even further.Be prepared to be amazed and entrenched in mysticism.",5 star rating
402,5/11/2018,Alot of fun! Took my bf here for his bday we both enjoyed the shows. Food was good too but very expensive. It was a nice change of pace. I would definitely reccomend going at least once in your life. It is an INVITE ONLY type of venue. SO if you know a member then you would have to politely ask to be invited. Very strict dress code. Gentlemen must have a sports coats or suit and tie no jeans or tennis shoes.Ladies dresses and pants suit with matching sports jacket as well no flip flopsEasy reservation after receiving invite.( The person inviting you doesnt have to be present but please be respectful while there since you're the guest )I reccomend making your reservation at least 2 weeks ahead of time and if u need to cancel or change the number of people going do so at least 24hours notice so u dont get charged a fee.Evening r 21 and over. Sunday brunch is kid friendly Super duper fun I wanna go back already,5 star rating

405,12/20/2015,"Randomly met a magician earlier this year and he nicely asked if I wanted to go to The Magic Castle, and I finally went with a few girlfriends last month. To get an invite, you can either contact one of the magicians, or stay at the hotel next door, though honestly the hotel looks really lackluster to me.Their weekends were booked, so we made dinner reservations for 9:45 pm on a Thursday night. Weird time for dinner, but you can go early and explore the castle, visit the several bars inside, and see the smaller shows. For us, the main show was at 11:00 pm. I actually enjoyed the smaller, more intimate shows more than I did the main show. The main show wasn't as amazing as I expected, plus it was freezing in the room. It's also cool to meet the magicians roaming around - we ran into a very chill one at one of the bars and he did a quick card trick for us.We loved the experience! How many chances do you get to dress up? Okay so some girls just wear clubbing dresses, I thought they would be more strict about the dress code. But still, I think it's fun to see everyone looking all polished. Almost feels like a different world in there. We're a little obsessed and definitely need to go back.",5 star rating
406,6/8/2016,"Just went here for the third time this past weekend and I still can't get enough of it! I tend to favor the dinner over brunch because I hate children. I also appreciate the strict dress code during the evening as well. I love to get all ""dressed up"" with hair and makeup for anything worthwhile so it's just my preference. Although the evening requires a ""strict"" dress code, I must say that I have seen a handful of female guests arrive in some of the most questionable attire. You can pretty much tell who frequents high end establishments and who doesn't. Not to say that this place is anything close to Michelin star rating. Far from it. But according to some guests (specifically females in their early 20's), appropriate evening attire consists of wearing an old Forever 21 club outfit from two years ago. :/ Like, you couldn't have at least gone to the contemporary section? It's the same price range as everything else in that store?As for the food... :/ Let's just say, it's obviously not the reason why people come here. If I had to compare it to anything, I'd probably say that it's the same exact quality as first class airplane food(domestic :/ ). I see so many reviews on how overpriced it is, but honestly... It's really NOT that ""expensive"". Calm down. I can name at least 10 other restaurants in LA that are way more overpriced with even WORSE quality. The ambiance and ""exclusivity"" is all factored into the pricing appropriately. The magic shows are all fairly entertaining for the most part. I hate being pointed out and put on the spot for participation but I always end up laughing about it after. If you don't like dressing up or paying over $50-$70(per person) for dinner, then this isn't the place for you.",5 star rating
407,9/6/2017,"I would like to start off by stating that I went to Magic Castle this weekend in the heat wave.  The temperature outside was over well over 95 degrees. I understand that a formal dress code is required; however, I thought that Magic Castle's strict adherence to this dress code was inappropriate given the sweltering temperature. One of the men in my parties took off his coat, and then not 5 minutes later, a worker told him to put his coat back on. Please note that the Magic Castle did not seem to have a working Air Conditioner. When we were waiting in line for a show around 9:45 for a 10:15 show, (as the line gets long quick), a man towards the front of the line began to try to exit the line, and then all of a sudden the man fainted!  Before that man fainted, people around me were complaining how hot it was, and how it was an inconvenience that they had to wear coats in the stuffy lounge.  I'm not being dramatic when I am saying the lounge was stuffy.  I had to put my hair in a ponytail because of the heat, and when I touched the back of my neck, it was dripping with sweat (and I had on a sleeveless dress). I could only imagine what it feels like to be standing in such a hot lounge waiting for well over 30 minutes in a coat.  I thought it was COMPLETELY unacceptable that the management did not go around and either offer people water, or at least place a fan in such a stuffy room. They should have let the men take off their coats. It's sad that a man had to faint for the management to realize that it's probably not in the best interest to enforce such a dress code.  I hope The Magic Castle can learn from this, as this was not a safe situation. In addition, the announcer/host who came in to the announce the performer was actually very rude. Someone in the audience asked to let a customer back in as he was a doctor and was helping the man who fainted, and the host was snappy, and you could tell the audience felt very uncomfortable with the host's attitude.  Other than that, the food was okay, but the best part of this experience was the magic shows (obviously). The later we stayed, the better the acts became. I am very glad that I got to experience this place, however I would greatly encourage The Magic Castle and its management to be more aware of these ""strict dress codes"" and its implications during a heat wave.",3 star rating

409,8/13/2017,"It is with a heavy heart that I have to admit to all you reading out there that The Magic Castle is over-hyped, overpriced and underwhelming. I was SO EXCITED when I randomly got 2 passes yesterday to attend that very evening. I was LITERALLY in the middle of lunch around 3:30pm in Huntington Beach- ran home, grabbed clothes, drove to LA, changed and got an uber and made it just in time for our 6pm Group Reservation. Slightly out of breath and with my heart pounding, I couldn't wait to see what mysteries and delights awaited me. The ""vibe"" is indeed vintage as far as the decor and in particular due to the guests that dress up for the occasion. The service is top notch and the food, while tasty, is very overpriced. You could easily go to a major Steakhouse in LA (Maestros, BOA, etc) and get a better meal for less or similar but not have to worry about the $30 entrance fee. Cocktails are weak and between $12-$15 each. I understand the entrance fee is to compensate the magicians or pay rent or whatever so I'm not against paying it to support the magical arts, but to be forced to also have dinner is a bit much. The shows range from 45 mins to 15 minutes and while some of them are entertaining, others are not, and certainly all of them leave something to be desired. Mostly card tricks and ""mind reading"" games- I was looking for something out of The Illusionist or The Prestige that would leave me wondering HOW IS IT POSSIBLE OR HOW DID HE DO IT? But alas, I was uninspired. Myself and my date decided to call it a night after 3 shows even though the Magic Castle was open for 2 more hours because we were kind of tired, bored and certainly out of cash after a few rounds of drinks and dinner. So much anticipation and we were kind of left thinking it was all just okay and MAYBE if the opportunity came our way again AND there was someone extraordinary performing that we would return. I think right now the Magic Castle is interested in churning out shows, booking dinner reservations and keeping this place so ""exclusive"" that people jump at the opportunity to spend $250 to go. Instead, I would recommend that The Magic Castle focus on getting quality entertainment to truly keep the brand of the establishment as one worth the cost.",3 star rating

411,11/8/2017,"Don't bother eating there if you are vegan. They had only one vegan option which was a flavorless tofu block on top of very minimal veggies. The sauce was flavorful, but not enough food to be filling. There was a vegetarian risotto I wanted, but they were unable to remove the cheese from the dish. Even the bread at the table was covered in cheese. The castle itself was really cool looking, but the acts were mediocre at best. It was hard to figure out where all the side shows were at. May be worth checking out once, but be prepared to spend a lot of money.",2 star rating
412,1/24/2018,"2018 Yelp Review challenge: 5/100Magic castle is a club for magicians. Only members and their guests are able to attend. You need to receive an invitation to go by getting an email from a member or entering with one. You need to make reservations at least 1 1/2 months in advance! Pros:1. Ambiance is AMAZING, cool Victorian architecture, little nooks and crannies to explore. 2. Check out the ghost piano player and the ghost bird! They are behind the main bar. You can also request songs for him to play. 3. Feel free to ask for directions. Everyone was super nice and willing to help. They even walked us to the theaters that we couldn't find. 4. Different sizes of theaters from intimate to large depending on the scale of the sizes. 5. Some bartenders do magic tricks!6. All indoors so you don't need to wear a jacket the whole time 7.

The magic was greaaaaattttt this was our second visit and the MAGIC was funtastic our favorite magician was DAVID RAMEY.

414,3/30/2014,"5 stars for entertainment and overall experience3 stars for food Been here twice. 1st time was with my college alumni association and that experience was above and beyond. One of the areas was blocked just for us, lots of room to meet and greet. Light appetizers served, nothing too memorable about that, typical finger foods of veggies, cheese, and fruits. Later on, free to go about the castle and shows. I was selected to assist with one of the magicians at the ""Up Close"" rooms. Although I sat less than a foot away from the magician, still didn't see the secrets. Due to limited time that visit, I was only able to see 3 shows.2nd time was the whole deal of making reservations, dinner, and shows. 6pm on Sundays seem to be a popular time for many folks. Line to get inside took longer than expected, a table was already ready for my party of 6. Each of us ordered a different entree. I started with the ahi tuna, but had to send it back because it was super salty. Even the manager came by to let me know he tried some of it and totally agreed. I replaced that with the mushroom ravioli. I hate to admit, but that tasted like pre-packaged ones you get in the frozen section at the market. By then most of the people in my group had finished eating and I didn't want to be rude to send more food back. $42 for mediocre ravioli (including tax and tip.)This time around I was able to see 5 shows. My favorite was still in the ""Up Close"" room. It was awesome that I got chosen to assist another magician in the same room. He even gave me a souvenir of the origami paper crane that I took and he pieced the paper back together. He also gave me a pack of really cool origami paper.  There was duo that were pretty hilarious. Overall, plan to spend about $100 (food, drinks, parking, and entrance fee), but definitely well worth it...maybe not the food, but I'm willing to give them another try. 3rd times a charm right?!",4 star rating
415,8/11/2015,"*300th ReviewIf you don't believe in magic, you might change your mind after I say this: I spent about 6 hours here on a Saturday night, and not one girl took out her phone the entire time to take a selfie. You read that right, not a single selfie was taken inside all night.That has to be magic.I also started off my time at The Magic Castle with a wad of cash in my back pocket, but as the night went on, it slowly but surely began to vanish into thin air. Magical indeed.Bros and DNBs that would normally be committing fashion offenses with their wardrobes transformed into well-dressed gents and ladies decked out in classy outfits. That's some serious wizardry to pull that off.Aside from those astonishing feats, most of the experience here involved drinking, eating, looking around, and watching performances. The Magic Castle epitomizes ""old Hollywood"" to me, and is reflected in everything from their design and decor to their (strictly enforced) dress code. Their staff also supports this image through their attire and demeanor. There is the aura of exclusivity and secrecy, and their no photo policy (aside from in the lobby and outside) reinforces this. There's no denying its specialness as an LA institution, and a visit here seems like one of those things you ""have to do once.""Out of respect for the mystery associated with the Castle, I will refrain from divulging too many details.TOUR: Our tour guide, Skipper (I don't remember his name so gave him that one), was a virtuoso of history and took us through several staircases and confined hallways in order to show us as much as possible before our dinner rezzy.  He's been working there for 28 years and is 90 years old! He was the coolest guy ever and didn't look a day over 89 to me. DRINKS: my love of melons attracted me to the Mystical Melon (vodka, lemon) first, but the Bulldog Bite (gin, strawberry) was like a magic potion.FOOD: while I wouldn't dine here if it was a stand-alone restaurant, there are some good dishes, even keeping in mind that the magicians aren't working in the kitchen. The menu on this night was made up of classic entrees ranging from about $30 to $50, such as IPA Braised Beef Short Rib, Filet Mignon, Creole Shrimp, Colorado Rack of Lamb, Honey Soy Glazed Sea Bass, and Pan-Seared Jidori Chicken. SHOWS: they can be seen all over the place in random rooms and even in bars. These 3 we watched reflect a wide spectrum of their offerings:-The Palace of Mystery: this is the after dinner show. Our's was ""The No Show"" and was full of comedic banter between the host and main performer, with audience interaction. The gimmick is that the custodian (on his way to take care of a toilet issue backstage) discovers that none of the performers showed up, so he ends up stumbling through doing impromptu performances of each of their acts.-The Mentalist: he's not a magician, he's a mind fu**er. I'd be giving it away if I gave an example of what he did, so will just say he gets participants to believe they physically sensed things that never happened.-Card Tricks: some of this was the usual that's been seen before, but there were a few twists (such as one card that a participant wrote her name on magically ending up in an envelope that was on the wall).The biggest magic trick of them all may have been how I managed to be granted entry. It involved getting last minute notice and busting my ass home to literally get ready in 12 minutes, then making my way from Newport to get through LA traffic. Arriving on time under those conditions, so I could get in, was some world-class witchcraft.",4 star rating
416,3/26/2016,"I was so mind blown the whole night! This was such an amazing experience and everyone should definitely go at least once. You do need to know a member or magician to get in though. Be prepared to do some damage to your wallet.I was very fortunate enough that my date knows one of the magicians and was performing this weekend so there was no cover charge for us. We came around 5:30PM on a Friday evening and it was not crowded at all but definitely people trickling in. Valet Parking is $13. Gentlemen, if you happen to forget/not bring an outer suit, they will loan you one once you check in. Make sure to wear a TIE!!! Ladies, make sure you wear heels that are comfortable to walk up and down stairs throughout the night. No jeans either!First started off with some drinks. The bartenders know their stuff, and $13 average for their cocktails. Make sure to stop by one of the bars if Mike is the bartender. Members say they always come back to see his magic, and I can definitely see why!I read a tip you can ask for a CASTLE TOUR from a knight! We did just that and our castle knight, Rich, was the sweetest and gave us a memorable tour of the castle. He gave us a brief history of the castle and then showed us around the places for the different shows and cool little random facts and items in the castle as well. He's a magician himself so near the end of the tour, he did a card magic trick on me, and that was pretty cool. 5 Stars for you Rich!!We had no prior RESERVATIONS FOR DINNER, so they would tell us to check in fifteen minutes pass the hour. Luckily, we were able to grab seats for 8:15PM. Just know that if you dine there for dinner, you get priority ticket passes to see either the Palace of Mystery (seats more people) or The Peller Theater (seats about 40). We didn't have a choice at that time so they gave us tickets for the Peller Theater, which I'm really happy we saw! Appetizer we chose was crispy pork belly, which wasn't bad at all! Ordered the Beef Wellington and Prime Rib - I'd rather order the Beef Wellington. I felt the prime rib lacked flavor. Food wise, I'd rate it 6.5/10.Make sure you LINE UP ABOUT 20-30 minutes before a show, then you'll get good seats for sure! Close-Up gallery only seats about 20 people or so, so make sure you get there early. We saw a performance from Jeff Black, the magician my date knew, and he was amazing - 5 stars for sure! We were in line 15 minutes before his performance and only able to get seats all the way in the back. SO remember to line up early!We also saw the last show for Rich and Randy at the Peller Theater, and my oh my that was so fun! Front and center, participated in the tricks - I was so blown away. Again, another 5 stars in my book.",5 star rating

Even if you aren't super into magic, the people here are some of the best of the best and you are guaranteed to be entertained.But honestly the Magic Castle is worth a visit just to explore the building itself--the decor is top notch and timeless, and there are so many rooms and twists and turns and secret passages! You could easily get lost if you aren't familiar with the place. Everybody at the club is dressed to the nines, so make sure you wear your best! The place definitely has a feel of golden-era Hollywood elite.The food is delicious--especially the chocolate lava cake! My only complaint is the lack of vegetarian options, as they only had one vegetarian entree (excluding fish dishes). That entree, the miso-roasted mushroom trio, was absolutely delicious, but it would have been nice is there had been at least one other option. The food was a bit pricey, but well worth it.My friends and I were here for almost six hours, and I honestly wish we could've stayed longer! Highly recommend.",5 star rating

421,1/29/2018,"Man!  Other reviewers here are SOOOO NAUGHTY.   No Photos, people!?Membership has its privileges...The Magic Castle is the clubhouse for the Academy of the Magical Arts.  Magicians and enthusiasts can join with a recommendation from another magician or enthusiast. The building is a modified original Victorian home built in 190X (something...) and carries alot of history and secrets.  There is a sister home, built by the same architect out in the I.E. somewhere. This clubhouse has memorabilia from magicians, its famous current and former members, and visitors worldwide - scattered in every direction you look. There's always something new to discover each time we're there.Fees are expensive, but once a member, you no longer need to book dinner or pay a door charge which makes it a nice little escape on a weekday night if one likes. Weekends are busy. RSVPs are hard to get because members are often hungry and dinner is required for non-members and their guests. Food is usually good. There's been some misses. Fairly expensive. Easily $50-$75 per person, then add wine...  To make up for it a bit though- the portions are generally huge and show tickets are guaranteed for the big room.Stuff I've had here (that I can remember):lobster bisque - yum1/2 roasted Chicken  - yum (but I have had a miss where is was kinda dry.)Steak- perfect every time.Wellington - perfect every time.Lambchops - OMG, so good! i kinda had to force myself to eat them though all because the portion was HUGE!lobster mac and cheese - eh?""loaded baked potato"" - eh? more loading, please.salmon (something) salmon was good, but the red sauce was a bit weird.Tuna tartar - good. not great.Service is generally top notch. Had a miss or two there over the years - never an issue that wasn't remedied with an inquiry.  Dress Code strictly enforced- for both guys & dolls, though ""fashion"" often tweaks what women can get away with. The idea here is to create a level of decency and subtle sophistication - that which is so terribly lacking in many Hollywood establishments situated just down the road at touristy H&H. The Castle keeps its allure partly by being set-up on the hill away from tourist-ville, upholding the dress code and NOT ALLOWING PHOTOS. Yes, the means even in the dining room.  I'd liken a night out here sort of like going to dinner and show in Vegas. Only better.  You'll be in like-minded, well dressed company. You may rub elbows with a celebrity or two. The best magicians in the world are here to impress: perhaps in a small pub, at a table in a corner, or maybe on a big stage. It's not unusual to get dinner, watch three or four different shows and end up chatting with some magical person at one of the many bars who happens to have a deck of cards on them and something to amaze you with.   In sum: we love visiting. And as long as we continue to get invited, we'll be happy to accept the invitation!",4 star rating

I would recommend that you go a little earlier than your reservation time to enjoy as many shows as possible. You will find that there's a lot of comedy intertwined as well. In regards to dining, the food is delicious and they offer a good selection of wine. The only negative was the gaps. In other words, if you missed a show and were just waiting then there's not much else to do other than to drink and wander around.

425,9/24/2017,"It doesn't get any classier or magical than this place. TIPS:- It costs $13 to valet your car (not including tip). You can use a credit card to pay for this expense at the front desk if you don't have any cash.- Formal wear is a must. I've seen them turn celebrities away at the door that weren't in dress code.- Try to go on a weekday. They are less busy when it's not a Fri/Sat/Sun night, so you are more likely to catch multiple magic shows and it won't be packed.- If you can, get a member to give you a grand tour of the place. They will know all the secrets, history, and get all the cool magicians to show you tricks along the way. (Some of the most impressive magic tricks I have seen have been from magician members that were simply wondering around the castle.)- There is a smoking area behind the valets outside. There are benches and ashtrays there. It is the only place that you can smoke on the premises.- Make sure to visit Irma, the ghostly pianist. She will often play any requests you have so long as you tip her some money in her birdcage.",5 star rating

It was about a group of 12-15 of us and we all had fun wherever he took us.The menu options are great. We had dinner there and we all seemed to enjoy all the food they provided. The drinks were great as well. The decor there is pretty cool, it feels like a true castle full of magicians. The main shows normally run at a certain time so make sure you try to make the best of the time while you're there. I've gone once and I think going once was enough. The reason why I think that is because I like magic but I'm not crazy over it. Overall such a fun, great experience!",4 star rating
428,7/21/2013,"Sunday brunch at Magic Castle!The first time I heard of the Magic Castle was back in the 70s when Johnny Carson would talk about being a member. Back then I imagined how cool a club for magicians must be. All these years later I finally had the opportunity to find out that yes, indeed, it really is pretty cool.An invitation from a member is required to come here for a meal and the shows. A good friend of mine received an invitation and I rode along on her coattails as her guest. The old multi-story Victorian mansion holds many rooms where magicians perform as well as rooms for relaxing and having a drink. There is also a large dining room.I went to three different magic shows; two were intimate up-close types of magic and the other was a stage performance of dazzling and astonishing magic tricks. All the shows were thoroughly enjoyable and full of great magic and humor.The brunch was much better than I anticipated. It was a buffet style meal. Some of the better items that I enjoyed were the prime rib, chicken & waffles, deviled eggs and the eclairs. The salad offerings were very good as was the ice cream station. Although I didn't have any, I was informed that the smoked salmon and the shrimp were very good too. The only bad thing I had was a beef rib which was too tough and not very meaty.All the staff - the valets, the hostesses, the waitstaff - were all very friendly and gave great customer service. While this place isn't cheap (you pay top dollar for valet parking, an admission fee and your meal) I left feeling like the overall experience was worth it. It was so fun to finally experience this magicians' lair.",5 star rating
429,5/24/2018,"Amazing place! I loved it so much, if you can go you must go! You will have so much fun and the food is terrific.Make sure to visit the magicians outside the big rooms because they will blow your mind as well! Too bad you can't take pictures in there but I understand they want to keep the mystery. I will recommend this place to everyone!",5 star rating
430,12/21/2017,"So I went here last night because I wanted to experienced the Magic Castle at Christmas. I thought it was a fun experience. But it is definitely an expensive evening (around $80 per person if you're not drinking there) and for how much you're spending I think there is room for improvement.It's supposed to be a fully magical experience, and I only saw two shows that were kind of mediocre. I feel like the architecture of the actual building itself was the best part about the experience. It's definitely all about the details with these kind of things you know? If it's going to be this exclusive and expensive of an experience then people are going to be expecting a legendary evening and it definitely wasn't that.My suggestions would be to add more activities for in between the shows and while you're exploring the castle. Like if there are optional activities like scavenger hunts, hidden objects, a murder mystery to play within your group, or even at least like a zoltar machine. I've been to places that have WAY more exciting features then the magic castle and were like a fourth of the price. This scarcity economics tactic has been working really well for them, but I don't necessarily believe using exclusively this tactic will support their reputation forever. To summarize, I had a good time. And I hate to say this but it isn't living up to its reputation and is kind of overrated. I think they should invest in some more detailed elements and activities to make it the full magical experience that it holds a reputation for.",3 star rating
431,8/21/2019,"My husband and I were too excited to try this place out. We had guests over from another state and considered this place as the perfect one to ""wow"" them. It turned out to be the worst experience ever - worst customer service, overpriced food and alcohol. I assume some of their employees take tips from other people and let them go in to the shows without waiting in the line. We waited in the line for a long time but ended up not being allowed to enter the show because of ""capacity"". Here comes another paradox - Those people who were standing behind us, went in without any issues. How's this even fair to their customers? So disappointing! No manager could solve this neither apologize for inconvenience! NEVER going back neither recommending! Don't waste your time and money! Don't get fooled by their fancy name!",1 star rating
432,10/9/2015,"Edit & Disclaimer: I've received quite a few messages asking me how to get into the Castle.  It is for members, their guests and guests of the Magic Castle Hotel.  Please do not message me to ask if I can help you get in (I can't). Thanks! :D__________________________________Being the girlfriend of a magician that goes to the Castle every year on his annual voyage to LA,  I'll admit that I've always been a little envious. Luckily, I decided to make the trip with him this year and the Castle was on our agenda for our last night in town.  We got all dressed up and headed over... I have to be honest, going into this thing I was excited but had no idea what was in store. When I left this place, omg. I guess you could say it's... (pause for dramatic effect) magical.We checked in with the hostess in the lobby and made our way into the Castle after saying the Secret Password to enter.  We grabbed two drinks at the bar before heading into a show in the theater, where we were dazzled and delighted by three wonderful magicians.  Some people think that being so close to the tricks that Lee does has complete desensitized me to the magic... if only someone had a camera on me during these shows, my facial reactions and frequent WHAT?!s under my breath would have you believing otherwise.  But alas, no cameras allowed!After the show, Lee introduced me to a couple of neat quirks about the Castle... there's something waiting for you around every corner. I won't spill the secrets, as that would be against the Magician's Code and I'd have to kill you (just kidding, I think. I didn't read the fine print).  Make sure you stop and pay a visit to Irma and ask her to play your favorite tunes... and don't forget to tip!  We ordered the crispy calamari while we hung out with Irma and though Lee enjoyed the appetizer, I was not overly impressed. I thought it was a bit rubbery and gave up after 2 pieces.  Thankfully I had a tasty glass of Sauvignon Blanc and the sweet, sweet sounds of Irma to make up for it.If you can get into this place, do it.  It's absolutely wonderful and I've been telling everyone about it... without giving too much away, of course ;)",5 star rating

434,2/2/2016,"Wow! It has been a few days since my visit to the Magic Castle and I'm still in awe! I'm so incredibly grateful that my fiancé and I received guest passes from a very gracious member! The ambiance is great--classy and elegant but fun and young at the same time. I love that they require everyone to dress up, which definitely adds to the entire experience. We had a reservation for the 8pm dinner, which we arrived to quite early, and they sat us down right away...in a romantic and cozy corner booth! I ordered the beet caprese which, unfortunately, was not to my liking. The cheese bread was tart though, as were our entrees (prime rib and beef wellington). Our server was very friendly and helpful and gave us some great drink recommendations! After dinner, we headed to the big show in the Palace of Mystery--loved it!! The performers were funny, personable, and lively. My fiancé even got the chance to be part of an act! We then moved to another room and I had the chance to be part of an act there! It was awesome! We then went to yet another room to watch the final show of our evening...all three shows were great! The castle itself is very interesting. The style and decor sets the stage for the entire experience. Be advised there is a $13 valet fee (self-park is not available), and a $30 cover fee per person. Dinner runs about $30-$45 per person, not including drinks or appetizers. For me, it was more than worth it!",5 star rating
435,7/22/2016,2 part review. Food and then Experience.The food was good but not worth the price. I ordered the Beef Wellington. It lets you know what cut of beef it is and is Tenderloin and not the normal Filet but that is ok. Missing some of the steps like the prosciutto and mushroom unless I got the super thin wrapped piece.No pictures. Their rules. The magic show makes up for the lacking dinner and if you think about the cost (s) it is a great deal. From 9:30 to 12:30 our group saw 4 different acts. Each act was different and kept me on the edge of my seat to see what is going on. The stages are close and most only seat 20 or so people so it is a cozy show. Dress code enforced so look nice or don't show up.Will go back sometime for more acts.,4 star rating
436,6/15/2015,"I never expected to be able to come here, because I don't know any members. Luckily for me, my friend gifted me a VIP card that was given to her by a member. The VIP card allowed me and 3 friends to attend without a member, and the admission fee was waived. A stipulation was that we had to make dinner reservations and purchase 1 entree per person. I felt that it was worth it to be able to experience this exclusive magicians club. Dress code is strict. Evening wear for women and tie and jacket for men. Valet parking is $13 and there are no options for self parking. Once inside, we checked in and gave a password to an owl sitting on a bookcase, which then opens to let you inside the main areas. NO photography is allowed past this bookcase. This rule has been in effect pretty much since they opened in January 1963. The decor is very theatrical and reminded me of the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland. It turns out that one of the designers of the Haunted Mansion was a member of the Magic Castle and sort of modeled it after that, having the magicians help him figure out how to make the ghosts appear. Or something to that effect. I can't remember exactly. Sheldon was a fantastic Castle Knight, aka tour guide! Because it was our first time at the castle, we wanted to take a tour to figure out the ins and outs of the place, and hear about the history. Sheldon really knows his information. He was interesting, animated, and intriguing. If you see him standing around at the beginning of the night (they leave at 9pm) you should definitely request a tour. This was one of my favorite experiences of the night.The way things are set up are that there are large shows which have set show times throughout the night. We checked out all of these except one, and my favorite was the Close Up Room. You're very close to the action and you still can't figure out how the magic is done! You usually need to get in line 30 minutes to an hour early on the weekends. You can also walk around and find people doing magic throughout. There are small rooms where you can sit at a magician's table and leave as you wish. These magicians are Magic Castle members and aren't paid, but definitely worth checking out. The magic is all very professional and the magicians are fun.There are 5 bars throughout the castle. On the weekends they are all open. You can order small bites if you don't have dinner reservations, or order from the drink menu. A few of the bartenders are magicians as well and do shows throughout the night. We had an 8pm dinner reservation which we made months in advance. The restaurant is reallllly loud but the food was great. Don't forget to ask for a bread basket. We started with the Cheesy Garlic Bread. It was delicious but a small amount for $9. Each of us in the group felt that the food was fantastic! I had the salmon with lemon risotto and asparagus sitting atop a tomato leek ragout. I tried a bite of the Filet Mignon which was even more delicious and melts in your mouth. Although you'll end up spending $50-$80/pp, it was worth it for a treat. When you dine you are given priority tickets to the Palace of Mystery show. This pretty much fills up with dinner guests so you probably don't have a good chance at getting a seat otherwise. Make sure you attend the showing right after you eat. Your ticket will not be valid for later showings. We spent 6.5 hours here and felt like we fulfilled a lot. It was an unforgettable experience and if given the chance to go, you must!",5 star rating
437,6/30/2019,"As a born and raised Los Angelenos I heard mention of the MC over the years and had a mild curiosity about it but never made any effort to go there. I had the opportunity to go last night and the actual experience does not live up to the mystic. The place has rigid and inhospitable policies.  As others mentioned you must order an entree. Ridiculous. I would have spent more $$ if I could have ordered appetizers and sides. We saw the main magic show and it was a snooze fest. There is a lot of waiting in line to get into theaters and no seat saving. Combine this with a 2 stall women's bathroom and end up with a dilemma as we did. Our group was waiting in line a good 15 minutes and a few women had to use the bathroom. The theater doors opened and 6 of us took our seats and when our 3 friends tried to rejoin us the staff made it into the crime of the century and called security. Really??? Really. I am a 57 year old 5'2 1/2"" woman in strappy heals and a sequin cocktail dress. I'm such a threat?? Maybe they didn't like the fact that we had people of color in our party?  Yes the Magic Castle is very white. I said it. Well. That's not all. After the fiasco in the prestidigitation room we took our group elsewhere. As we were trying to navigate the CROWDED staircases (more lines even on the stairs) my friend took a nasty spill. No staff came to aid us. When I went to get a glass of water for my friend I couldn't even get  someone's attention for a glass of water at the bar. I had to search out someone who barked orders to the bar staff for water ""stat"" and before my friend had a chance to sip it the staff was descending on her with ""forms"" and ""clipboards"".   Worried about liability more than her well being.  Just as we were trying to get our bearings another crime was committed, an innocent picture was snapped of our guest of honor and her daughter. Staff was grabbing the ""offender"" and trying to erase the photo. Enough was enough. We made our exit. This place is more hype than substance. It exists merely to give second and third tier magicians a paycheck. I would never return to this pretentious tourist trap.",1 star rating

439,2/3/2019,"A special night out that you'll remember forever.  This place is truly magical and you have to just do it right if you go.  Dress to impress, I wore a ballgown and I didn't feel overdressed while there.  In fact, there were at least 10 other women wearing dressier outfits than me.  They were dressed like they were going to the Oscars.  We didn't eat there, but I think next time we come we would like to.  I don't want to ruin the surprised of what's inside but its filled with stages and magicians!  Given my boyfriend is a magician, I've seen lots of shows before coming here.  While some of the shows I saw this night were good, some were also not so good but that's what is fun about it.  You can learn about different styles of magic and have a lot to talk about with your friends the next few days.  Leave your phone at home and just be present when you come here, phones aren't allowed anyway.  Some things are just better when you get to explore them yourself!",5 star rating
440,5/29/2015,"200 review for the one and only Magic Castle! Strict dress code! Photography permitted only on the outside.Exclusive club for members and invited guests only at the heart of Hollywood. Located next to Hollywood & Highland and El Capitan. An artistic mansion filled with history and magic.Valet is available for $13 a vehicle or the red line underneath Hollywood and Highland (beware for the hill going up and down). The valet line can be a bit packed depending on your arrival and/or exiting times. Highly suggest going there at least 20 min prior to reservation time. There are many close-ups and one big show for the magic enthusiasts but must arrive early or stay later to catch them all. Magicians are often changed, magiccastle.com/schedule to check out the performers. We enjoyed it! Food! It was great for the most part. Some of the items were a little over done but our focus was for the shows.  Lobster bisque was so memorable!",5 star rating
441,6/15/2015,"My friend is a magician here and whenever he does shows, we get to go in free! :) It's so awesome being here, definitely gives it an old vibe feel not like Vegas Magicians. A very historic site and it's cool at the entry when you tell the owl open sesame for the book cases to open the doorway for you :DI heard The Magic Castle got burned down once and they rebuilt it so it's haunted in some parts? The place is pretty big and it's a fun place to be late at night. They have a restaurant here and the food isn't too bad. My favorite area is the piano room where you can request ""the ghost"" to play a song for you and she actually plays it really well!For the most part it's fun to watch the magic and even more entertaining watching the reactions of drunk people haha. Speaking of which there are a couple of bars and the drinks are pretty pricey. There are multiple rooms here hosting different shows so be sure to check the schedule! Other than that it's a great place to have fun and watch live magic! REAL magic, none of that criss angel BS LOL",5 star rating
442,7/26/2017,"Way over-hyped.  The dinner show was a HUGE letdown.  The entire time we thought the magicians on stage were being funny and purposely messing up or exposing the strings they were using.  We thought it was building up to something good.  Nothing.  It's only a 40 min show, but if I wasn't there with a group of friends, I would have gotten up and left.  The close up magic on the entry floor and down in the basement level were so much better.For dinner, I had the prime rib cajun style which was probably one of the better prime rib that I've had.  It was a bit more expensive than other 'fancy' places, but I figured given the exclusiveness of the place and that we get to see a show after dinner, it would be worth it.I know the dinner show changes on a daily basis, so I'm sure there are better ones to be seen, but damn it feels like a rip off when the worse show of the night is one where you paid $200 to see.",2 star rating

447,2/1/2016,"It's a fun place to go at least once - for sure. I don't know what I was expecting. I wasn't necessarily hoping for Chris Angel level magic, but I at least thought there'd be a little smoke and more audience participation. The magicians here are a few levels above street performers and the sleight of hand is more than impressive. My rating might've been slightly higher, but I just can't get over how outrageous the prices were. Yes, I know the menu is listed on their website and I knew what I was getting myself into, but still... it's pricey. I like options. Either way the food is good, I liked my rack of lamp. The crab soup was just okay. The creme brulee and banana cream pie were great - I've had better chocolate cake.I wasn't too impressed with the 'Big Show'. One magician was super cheesy and the other had no personality. In the closing number the guy dropped the floating ball and I was too sleepy to care that he made another person appear on stage. Overall a cute atmosphere and interesting place. You don't have to break your neck trying to dress super fancy (I was stressed that I wouldn't meet the dress code and then felt overdressed compared to what other people were wearing). Definitely a place to go to at least once (just to say you've been), but I can't see why people would go more than once unless they're a part of the magic community.",3 star rating
448,5/6/2016,"My second time here in 8 years. In many ways it seemed not much has changed. It's a very traditional establishment. I rate the entire experience as a 5. You need to either be a member or have an invite in order to get in. There is a dress code. I wore a suit and tie with nice all black sneakers but I had to change my shoes still. Even with an invite there is still a door charge. You say a magic word to get in. When you get in there are a list of shows you can watch. You can also get a drink by the bar. I got the old fashioned and the Moscow Mule. Both were good. The old fashion was strong, the way I like it. I'd say the drinks are good but not amazing. Price range $14-$15 a drink. Then we had our meal. I had the beef Wellington because I had seen some good reviews on that dish. It was good! Was it worth the $40 price tag? I've had better but again it's for the whole experience.. which if you think of it that way then it's worth it. We also ordered fried pork belly appetizer. The portion size was smaller than I expected. Also it was okay so next time I probably won't get that. A friend got the $72 bone in ribeye which was a special that evening. It was very flavorful but for that price if say if you are just rating food quality id say Mastros is better. We then had the pistachio creme brûlée. It was also good. Like 4/5. Anyways, not taking anything away from the food here. I think the entire experience plus atmosphere is amazing. We watched 3 shows total. One was up close then the other was in the mystery palace. I enjoyed the performers personalities. They made us all laugh and had some interesting acts. Overall great time.",5 star rating

Or just grab something quick at the bar so you can go see more magic shows!If you dine, the beef wellington is something that they are known for.

They really want everyone to enjoy their visit from the beginning to the end.  Kids are treated very nicely by the staff as well. They usually get seated in the front row when the magicians are performing and sometimes they get to assist the magician.  My son helped out on one occasion.   A director of sorts walks around and tells you where to line up for the next performance. Ambiance:  5/5 StarsThe Magic Castle is such a beautiful old Victorian and is really eye catching on the outside.  I was very curious as to whether or not is had historical-cultural landmark status since is is over 100 years old.  I googled it, but couldn't find anything.  There is so much memorabilia inside from photos, hidden doors, paintings with roving eyes and the list goes on.  I could spend a whole day just looking at everything in the whole place.  They had some interesting sound effects in the Ladies Room.  It was very funny.  I really wish I could have taken photos, but one of their rules is no photos inside.   They have lots of little rooms for performances, a Dining Room upstairs, bars for ordering drinks here and there and a basement with more rooms.Parking:  5/5 StarsValet Misc. Information:* $15.00 cover charge* $36.95 for brunch (tip not included)*  No jeans or flip flops*  No photos inside*  If you are seated for the early brunch at 11:00 a.m. eat quickly because there will be a performance at the Parlour of Prestidgitation at 12:15 p.m. and then the main performance will be at the Palace of Mystery at 12:45 p.m.*There are many other little rooms with various performances and I think we saw 5 in total.If you ever get the opportunity to go to the Magic Castle you should definitely go.",5 star rating

A bottle of estate MacMurray Pinot Noir was equally outstanding full yet smoorh all the way.  Desert of strawberry ""tres leches"" cake was equal to the rest.  First class dining.",5 star rating

457,9/3/2016,"Alas, i got an invite to the magic castle!!! How excited was i when i found out and the dreadful 3 months of waiting for my reservation date to finally come!!First, they get booked out quite far so reserve as soon as you get an invite! But lets get to the good stuff!When we arrived, its valet only so be prepared to pay $13 for the valet. Outside there is a backround where you can take pictures for your evidence being there (take advantage of this because theres absolutely no photography inside!) When i entered, i felt like i was in a Harry Potter movie. Say a magical password to get through the door and let the magical begin. Go early to catch the Up Close show...i hear its quite good although the magician we had was older and i saw a lot of his hiding tricks but its okay, theres plenty more to explore! As you roam around the castle, be sure to visit Irma, she will play any song you request, as long as she knows it and be sure to thank her. She played Canon in D for me! I found that the best magicians are the ones not scheduled...the ones you roam into rooms and they just start once theyve gathered enough people. Out of all the magicians i saw, Hannibal and Jheff was my favorite. The main show was meh to me and it didnt quite impress me.The food...the menu looks absolutely fabulous with plenty of pricy entrees to choose from. We ordered the pork belly, shrimp cocktail, prime rib, mac and cheese, brussel sprouts and a couple more things i forget since it took me awhile to get to this review. The food is mediocre, nothing to brag about, but its not bad and definitely passed my palate's test, but i have had better.Overall, its a great place, an experience you got to try at least once, especially if you like magic. I would definitely be back when i get another invite!",4 star rating
458,10/11/2017,"So bummed they don't allow pictures inside!! But they do allow pictures outside and in the lobby before actually entering the castle. It's definitely quite an experience. They have different rooms with different shows going on, some small and intimate, others being bigger. They have several different bars through out the castle, as well as, a server that comes by to take drink orders while you're at your seat, waiting for the show to start. As for the restaurant, I wasn't too impressed with the food. But it might be that I had extremely high expectations. I got their lamb which was seasoned well but it was a bit tough. Considering how packed the dining area was, service was good and our food came out in a timely manner. They have a strict dress code for both men and women. It is formal attire, so make sure to come dressed to impress. LADIES, I would highly recommend wearing COMFORTABLE SHOES. There are stairs inside and it does get pretty dark as well. There is also a lot of standing around and walking involved so be smart.I took off one star because of how crowded and congested it can get inside. I felt like I was playing bumper car all night.Overall, it's definitely a great experience!!",4 star rating

The Door host was great too, I didn't catch his name.  I had the Beef Wellington, my husband had the lamb.  There are a lot of comments about the quality of food, it was fine.  Its basically dinner theater so I am sure they prepare and serve very much like a wedding or banquet. Maybe a but under-seasoned but the quality of meat was great. The 8pm show was fun, think more vaudeville than David Copperfield.  The place was packed in the evening so I am glad we got an early reservation. Would definitly go back if I had the chance.",4 star rating

The lady on the phone said ""dress casual,"" not, ""the dress code is dressy casual.""  Overrated. Save yourself from staying at their dirty, overpriced, suite if you're not a member.

464,8/4/2015,"If given the opportunity to come to the Magic Castle, do it! It's a great experience and not one that happens frequently, or is accessible in other parts of the nation. I was lucky to have been able to come twice thus far, once with the Freemasons and the second time with a guest pass from a generous magician.Parking is 13$ valet with no option to self-park. You pay the valet fee inside at the hostess stand, and if you need to pay a cover charge, you can pay that + valet in one transaction.Unbeknownst to us it was Junior Magicians week, with young magicians between the ages of 13-20 showcasing their work. They were all very talented and many had the showmanship of very seasoned performers. I left the Magic Castle that night very impressed with the younger magicians! There were also a lot of older magicians scattered about the Castle so there was a good mix of young and older :)Dinner was actually pretty good for us! Our server, Evan was great and our food came out prompt and served hot. We split a soup and salad, had two entrees, a glass of wine and two desserts for $137 (not including tip). I let Evan know we were celebrating a birthday and they graciously brought out a slice of chocolate cake with a lit candle (Evan even stuck around to sing Happy Birthday with us) and a flute of champagne.If you're not a member, it's highly suggested you make dinner reservations to be granted access into the larger Palace of Mystery theater (they give you your ticket at the end of your meal). They have 3 performances throughout the night in this theater, so whatever your dinner time may be, you'll be able to see a show. There is also a separate line for non-ticketed guests for these showings so if the theater is not filled to capacity, you may be able to snag any remaining seats.Helpful hint for the ladies: it is cold inside! And even more frigid inside the dining room. Bring a shrug or a small jacket, but still making sure it's dress code appropriate (I've read reviews of women having to check in their jackets for having zippers on them). The place is also mostly carpeted with many stairs throughout, so make sure your heels are comfy.",5 star rating
465,5/7/2015,"I've wanted to come to the Magic Castle for years, so when a darling friend of mine invited me I quickly jumped at the opportunity.  This visit didn't involve the long sit down dining experience.  We went straight for the shows.There are three bars to get your night going.  They serve food, so you could order some apps between shows.  I was a big fan of the classic shrimp cocktail.  My favorite show of the night was at the Close-up gallery shows.  There's nothing like seeing magic in an intimate setting.  How does one pull a full sized wooden baseball bat out of nowhere or make something appear that wasn't there a second before?We were also able to see a show in the Parlour of Prestidigitation.   It's a larger venue fitting I'd guess 80 - 100 people.  In this environment, performers are able to take members of the audience as part of the show.  There's a lot to experience at the Magic Castle.  You would have to make multiple trips with a proper guide giving you the history behind the establishment.  Even then, there will always be that story you've never heard.",4 star rating
466,11/17/2017,"I've been a Magician Member since 1993 and there was this gap of years where the Castle was just plain. It didn't 'feel' exclusive or anything to talk about. NOW... it's just amazing. The food is better, the acts are better. More rooms - more shows. It's awesome.The best close up show you'll see at the castle is downstairs at the Cat and Hare with resident magician/bartender Mike Pisciotta. So if you're a guest, or a guest of a member - make sure to ask a Castle Knight to show you the way to Cat and Hare.",5 star rating
467,2/11/2018,"Mind-blown. I keep thinking about what happened last night and I can't explain even put them into words! It was truly a memorable night. No wonder this place is known as Mecca for magicians! They're all so talented and now I am a believer  there are people out there with special powers! The place itself was incredible. It had this vintage feel that made it extra special. It was also great to dress up for the night since their dress code was super strict.  Phones were not allowed which was great so we really got to enjoy the place. There were many shows to choose from but we specifically enjoyed the intimate ones where we were  up close with the magicians. I purposely tried to trick them when they would asked me to think about cards, items, etc to see if they can guess it. And of course they did! My friends and I left the place super impressed and can't believe we just saw all these great magicians in action.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this place and hopefully can come back someday.I'm giving it a four-star because of the food. Although the experience was great, I wasn't super impressed with the food. I had filet mignon and almost choked when I saw how small it was! It was very pricey and was hoping the taste/flavor of the food will make up for the price but no. The food was meh. My husband and friends enjoyed the drinks though so that's a plus.",4 star rating

470,5/11/2018,"This was my first time visiting the Magic Castle. I heard so much about it. This is definitely overhyped. What a disapoinment. We saw several shows nothing's really changed in magic apperantly ..rice from bowls... transposition of water and salt.. a dancing handkerchief  routine etx etc.... same old stuff.My friends had the steak dinner and a soup it was salty. I had the polenta it was salty as well. The chefs are probably smokers and they can't even taste what they're cooking.The drinks are overpriced and you better stick to simple drinks cuz the bartenders really don't know what they're doing.We felt like cattle, the place is packed. Wall to wall people. For an exclusive Club there sure is a lot of people.... all you see is just a herd of people waiting in line for one performer then waiting in another line ...it's like Disneyland only worse. It's so claustrophobic in there. You're constantly being pushed around.They really try to oversell the exclusivity but when you get in there you could tell it's all hype. They're constantly trying to sell you or upsell you something. The dining room tables are packed and small ...the waiters keep hitting you on your elbows when they walk by. there's no room they really try to pack as many people as they can in the dinning rooms. the acoustics is terrible it is so loud you can't even hear yourself talk. The waiters are dressed with Tails but don't be fooled they're obnoxious and they can't wait to get your order and get you out of there. Our waiter was condescending..... couldn't even look at us was taking our order while he was looking around. The steak and lobster dishes are equivalent to a c grade surf and turf  Steakhouse....only the prices here are ridiculously over priced.The three shows we saw were really mediocre. Hardly any originality it's just the same old rehashed stuff that you could see on TV. The only reason we had a good time was because of the company we had...and mocking the cheesy performers. Never again. Save you money go to Universal Studios or dine out at Santa Monica....anywhere but here.The laugh factory or any other comedy place is money better spent. You'll see a lot more original stuff that's for sure.",1 star rating

474,1/10/2019,"The allure of the magic castle is that they make it a bit exclusive to try and get into so it's nice to say you've been once.  But the staff service makes certain that you only want to go once and not return thereafter. We went during brunch on Saturday 1/5/19, and across the board with various members in our party, we found the front desk receptionist to be quite rude and apathetic.  From the very beginning she was lacking customer service skills upon entry, and got worse upon our departure once she realized she had to help reverse transactions.  It was disappointing and I hope that she will be addressed to improve future interactions with guests.The brunch offering is yummy but still not worth the nearly $60 you will pay to dine there.  The waiter was brusque and we were rushed throughout the entire meal.  He expressed frustration and made little side comments when we requested more mimosas or splitting of the checks.  This place is kitschy but certainly will not make you feel as a valued guest.  They know they don't need you, you just want to be able to say you've been there and thus they treat you that way accordingly.  As a result most of us will not be returning.",3 star rating

476,2/15/2015,"The Magic Castle is a Los Angeles institution and a must see for any tourist or local alike. I was lucky enough to know a member of the The Magic Castle and scored tickets to a Friday night visit and I have to admit it was a wonderful time. You will need to know a member or stay at the next door Hotel in order to attend the shows and dinner so if you have the means, by all means take advantage! If you forget your ticket, you will not be given admittance so consider yourself warned. Once inside you are welcomed by a huge and gorgeous bar to order drinks from and then stroll throughout the bar area checking out the wandering magicians and other fun attractions seemingly everywhere. There is also an upstairs Parlor that connects with the formal dining room, so no matter where you find yourself a cocktail is nearby. Dinner is included in your admission and The Magic Castle puts together a decent Prime Rib considering that Magic is the heart and soul of the business however you will not mistake this for Lawry's or Five Crowns anytime soon. After Dinner everyone is sat down in the Theatre to enjoy an hour long Magic show performed by visiting Magicians that I thoroughly enjoyed. After the show you are allowed to wonder the Castle and be entertained by Magicians that seem to be in every nook and cranny as well as several small and personal showings in the larger rooms. I do not want to spoil the fun so I will keep details brief but I promise you it is a blast. The Magic Castle is a unique and wonderful Hollywood experience.",4 star rating
477,8/16/2019,"We celebrated our wedding anniversary there last night and let me tell ya, it was a real treat to be there. It's just a magical place (no pun intended), and so unique with its dark wood walls, it's old-fashioned ambience coupled with quirky paintings and a whimsical undercurrent in all the rooms. We loved having Rich Freeman as our tour guide. He was so knowledgeable and such a charming person. He's been a member there for 50 years, his wife is part of the Women's Magic Club, and he knows every nook and cranny in that place. He will give you all the inside scoop. We didn't have dinner reservations but Rich helped us with that, and boy, were we thankful!!! Dinner was delicious! We had beef Wellington and prime rib, and they even brought out cake to celebrate my husband's upcoming birthday. We got tickets to the main show and that was something else! Bruce Gold, Joseph Tran (whom I've hired before for a work event), and David and Dania were spectacular! We also watched the magic shows in the other rooms and they were all amazing. The drinks were good (by the end of the night, the owls were taking to us), and the place was just full of mystique, edginess, humor, and just old-fashioned sense of decorum that you don't get anywhere else. There's no place like it. We are so glad we went and celebrated our special day there. Thank you, Rich Freeman, for making our day memorable and special!!! You're the best!!!

I heard that weekends get packed. Luckily, we were able to attend every single show going on that night. We were super exhausted by the end, since the last show was at 12:30AM. But all in all, it was worth it, and I'm super glad I got to experience this.

The decor was eveything i thought it would be.  I love places that hold so much history, and this is one of them.  Old newspaper cutouts/articles and pictures cover the walls.  The interior is dark... (not to offend anyone, but the best way I can describe it is that it reminds me of the interior of an Old Spaghetti Factory).   I'm here for magic... but first... the buffet, which is located upstairs. I have mixed feelings about our server.  He was kind to me, but he was not the friendliest towards my kids... he seemed a little inpatient.The buffet offered fruits, salad, poke with won ton chips, omelet station, bacon/sausage, sauteed veggies, raviolis, salmon croquette, carved roast and the highlight, for me anyway, was the Alaskan King crab legs.  My hubby's favorite item off the buffet was the mushroom ravioli.  My table also enjoyed mimosas, assorted juices (apple, cranberry, orange), Shirley temples, and coffee.  I tried four of the assorted petite desserts... I did not care for any.You will be given a ticket to the main magic show depending on what time your brunch seating is.  ** if you are NOT done drinking your mimosa... please get a refill/top it off - you can walk around with your drink in-hand!... wish someone told me this! We were ushered to the room, kids got to sit in the front (great!)... the two magicians were true entertainers!  Witty, funny, and they knew their audience and tailored to us.  No spoilers here.  But I think my favorite of the two shows was the close-up magic with the female magician.  She was only 19, but seemed like a seasoned professional.  She was well poised, such a good storyteller and... awesome with card tricks.  Sometimes I think it's harder performing in a more intimate setting with the audience just one foot away from you.  We didn't make it to the third show.  Depending on the people (audience) there waiting to see the show... I feel like waiting in line at Disneyland for the 60th anniverary celebration was more pleasant than waiting in line to see the magic show.  I'm so glad we took a chance and tried it.",4 star rating

We came for my birthday with 5 of my friends and we had an unforgettable experience searching through the entire castle for magic and found it in every corner of the place! Be prepared to spend $$$$, every drink is extremely expensive and the dinner you are required to buy is pricey as well.

The first time I attended I was pretty much amazed at everything! The shows you actually wait for are intended for people 18 and over I assume. What I loved the most were the random magicians coming up to you and showing you a magic trick right in front of your eyes! Even though you get invited, you still have to pay $30 bucks and dinner reservations are required. The dinners are pretty pricy and the food was mediocre for me (sorry no photos of the food since pictures are not allowed in the castle). There are bars located everywhere so have a drink or 2, or 3, or 4....haha.I think the magic castle is worth going to at least once in your life. The 2nd time I went wasn't as fascinating since most of your fascination goes away the initial time you go. I went for a work event and a magician ended up escorting our group so he was very helpful in regards to showing us around. He also hooked us up with more invitations!

484,5/3/2017,"ok so the real magic for me here was getting to eat in a restaurant. as i've mentioned a hundred thousand times, i have severe allergies. SEVERE. i carry epi pens on me all the time, zantac, benadryl, i wear a medic alert bracelet, the whole nine. typically when i travel i get a place with a kitchen, when i go to weddings i don't eat, i'm used to it. it's ok because i've lived this way a long time and it's usually way easier to not deal with restaurants due to cross contamination and anxiety. for me the biggest problems tend to be spices and cheeses and just really arbitrary stuff that makes it so difficult i'd rather not. plus there's a weird shame attached to it, i don't know, i don't like making myself the center of attention listing off 900 things i can't have in my food. my husband has a coworker who is a member here and he got us in and since dinner is mandatory if you're not a member i was -dreading- it. However they made it awesome and easy. My husband spoke extensively the head chef, they hashed out a Bridget-safe meal ahead of time, our server Carissa knew my deal before we sat down (i think everyone did), and I had a delicious allergen free meal and almost cried because it's been literally years since i've had a full meal -in- a restaurant (i'll sometimes brave takeout since i can go home and eat, getting sick at home is less embarrassing). Apparently they deal with food allergies and sensitivities a fair amount. I'm guessing since it's a members only club and they want to keep their members happy, they go the extra mile, but still man, it felt awesome to not feel like i was inconveniencing anyone by having shitty health. the shows themselves were great.  since we were ticketed we got priority seats for the main show which was kind of grandiose and a little cheesy (in a good way) and then we ran all over checking out all the different types of close up magic and bar magic and wandered the basement peeping in on magicians workshopping with each other (that was super cool)my heart pretty much belongs to Irma though, the awesome haunted piano.",5 star rating

If you are able to get in following my notes above, you are welcomed to a very exclusive event. I can't compare this to any showings or private event hosted and highly recommend checking this place out if you are able to get an invite. I was overall quite entertain and I do now believe in magic. Entry to the lobby is very small. But here is where you check in and they will provide a password which will grant you access to the rest of the castle.  If you forget your tie, they will loan you one. I felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie.  The castle layout has a lot of different walkways, stairs, rooms, bars, and hang out spot for you to roam. You are welcome to walk anywhere and there are attendants around to make recommendations on where to go depending on the different show times.  There are a 3 main magic shows that do require tickets and are performed by professional magicians. I recommend watching at least 1 main show. All the other smaller magic shows in smaller rooms, you are welcome to roam in and out. The junior magicians are the performers for the smaller audience.  They aren't too bad but you can tell they are still practicing. You can also dine here. But make sure you make reservation in advance. The average price for the main entree is $35. Food here is good too with a formal venue. Service was great and the food came out fresh and hot!!",5 star rating
487,11/25/2018,The entire show is over rated. Very expensive for what you get and the experience was okay. I wouldn't see it again.  I think more could be done to keep people wanting to return over and over...,3 star rating
488,6/9/2017,"My boyfriend and I popped our Magic Castle cherries last night (Thursday) and loved it!-Members/invitation only to enter -Open 7 days a week from 5pm - 2am-$20 entrance fee per person on Mon-Thurs, $30 Sat & Sun-21+ except Saturday & Sunday brunch-STRICT formal dress code! -$13 valet only -No photography allowed at all inside past the magic bookcase -As of 2017, all guests are required to have dinner reservations. Your credit card will be on file to hold your reservation. If you don't cancel your reservation or someone from your group cancels, you'll be charged $25 per head that doesn't show. If you check in to the castle but don't dine, you'll be charged $50 per head.-You may enter the castle as early as 5pm regardless of what your dinner reservation time is.-Each diner must order an entree at minimum. Entrees start at $35 (which is the garden gnocchi). -After dinner, you'll receive tickets to the closest available time for the main show at ""The Palace of Mystery"" - this is the longest show (45 mins) and when we watched, there were 3 stunning performances! Tickets are not required to watch the show, but diners have priority seating tickets! We sat front and center! -There are 5 bars throughout the castle and you're able to bring your drinks into any show room. If you open a tab at one bar, you can still give your name at any other bar to get a drink.-Specialty drinks are $14, with exception of Neil Patrick Harris Old Fashioned @ $15.The Magic Castle was smaller than I imagined, but still spacious and it was fun to wander around various staircases and hallways! It has a very vintage, spooky vibe which adds to the fun. I ordered the salmon entree ($39) for dinner and thought it was mediocre and overpriced. The service was fine. I felt like my water glass was refilled after each sip. Each of the 9 performers we watched were nothing short of mind blowing and amazing! We sat up close for most of the shows and were able to be part of the show, examine the props, take home a souvenir or sign a playing card and watch it disappear right before our eyes! I signed 3 cards that night - I only kept 2 because 1 of them magically appeared in the magician's mouth! For a Thursday in June, I did not think it was crowded at all. We were able to see every show we wanted! There was never a wait for the bar, restaurant, or restroom. I was actually alone in the restroom a few times which was kind of creepy because there are lots of mirrors and vintage-y things! As expected, weekends are booked to the max from what I heard from others and because I tried to book our visit for the weekend!Keep in mind that this magical experience may be pricey! Before we even entered thru the magical bookcase, we already spent $53 ($20 entrance x 2 and valet $13). Next, dinner is AT LEAST $35 per person. Then add alcoholic beverages and gift shop souvenirs! My boyfriend and I had a memorable night at the Magic Castle and can't wait to visit again and enjoy more performances!!",5 star rating
489,2/19/2017,"I went here for my birthday in Dec. My friends and I had the worst experience. The only good thing about this night was the steak I ate at dinner. It turns out that we double tipped for our dinner as they had already included the tip in the service charge. The server didn't mention anything, she simply hand us the check.We were 3 mins late to the main show and not able to enter. We had to wait an hour for the next one (and even then there was no guarantee that they we could go in). We ended up watching the main show but my group was split up in pairs and one sat by themselves. I ended up leaving half way through. The manager was extremely rude. This place is overrated.",1 star rating
490,1/4/2019,The 5 stars review is for the magic: enchanting! I have been twice now and I still can't wrap my head around the tricks. I think it lives up to the hype. I was able to be entertained from the moment I set into the castle (5+ hours total). Definitely check out the bars for the shows- those smaller acts were some of my favorites. I loved the self playing piano- you can request a song. As for the food- lower your expectations and you won't be disappointed- it's edible but there's no wow factor there. The food may not be worth the price but the magic makes the whole night worth it. Make sure to stay for the late night shows- they save some of the best for last. Recommend bringing cash.,5 star rating
491,8/22/2017,"Manager reached out to say sorry for the experience; GM and chef were supposed to contact me but never did. So my original review stands:Terrible time; this establishment would be better served just charging for magic shows and cocktails, instead of adding insult to the injury of having to eat here. There's no exclusivity to going, either; just look at all the reviews here people! But even a one time visit means $$$ for MC, so what do they care.",2 star rating
492,3/2/2017,"Okay I think it's time for an update since I posted my original review as I have now visited the Magic Castle five times, and had dinner there once. If you are accompanied by a magician member, and they put you on their guest list, you can skip the $30 door charge and you aren't required to make dinner reservations. But, if a magician invites you and does not physically join you then that means you aren't on their guest list, and you will have to pay the door charge/make dinner reservations, which is still totally awesome. Let it be understood that at the end of the day you have to be invited.I've read a few reviews with people complaining they didn't get their money's worth and blah blah blah. Here's the deal, follow my advice - if you get invited - make a reservation in advance. Like way in advance. Two months in advance. There are three dinner times, 6pm, 8pm, and 9:15pm. The first two dinner slots fill up quickly. I made reservations for my family and I two weeks prior to our visit and got stuck with the 9:15pm reservation on a Sunday night, which wasn't really all that bad. We're night owls anyway. Get there early. For the majority of people this is a once in a lifetime experience, so make sure you get the most out of it. Get there when the castle opens right at 5pm. They will give you a schedule with all of the night's shows and which theater each magician is performing in. Get in line for the first show at the Close-Up Theater, which features one magician doing - you guessed it - close-up magic. The show usually starts shortly after they open. The other theaters don't start their shows until later on around 7pm or 8pm.We're all here for magic right? So try to see as many shows as possible! Look, you're gonna be spending a ton of money whether you're on a magician's guest list or not, so the more shows you see the better your experience will be. You're going to the ""Magic Castle"" so make sure it's magical! Also let it be known each theater, with the except for one, is extremely small. Like 20 people max if I'm not mistaken, so you have to get in line for each show early. I'd say around 45 minutes early or else you probably won't get in. If you have dinner reservations they will give you a *guaranteed* ticket for the largest and most theatrical show at the Palace of Mystery, but you can't redeem it until after you've finished your dinner, so keep that in mind. Dinner was amazing. I had the salmon and it was so yummy. The rest of my family enjoyed their entrees too, we ordered a bottle of champagne, my cousin got a dessert for her birthday. It was lovely. They have many entrees to choose from, and also have vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free choices as well. I believe they offer Kosher food if you request it a few days in advance. It's important to note each person must order an entree. You can't get away with ordering just a salad or an appetizer, so come hungry. Each entree is around $35 and up.The castle closes at 2am and there are so many cool things to see. If you get there early like I recommend you will have plenty of time to see what the castle has to offer. There is history literally everywhere. Read everything, check out the stuff on the walls, grab a drink, go listen to Irma the piano playing ghost and request a song. Just make sure to tip her - she can be feisty at times. I highly recommend the Neil Patrick Harris Old Fashioned because it's strong and it gets the job done.The Magic Castle has literally become one of my favorite places because every time I'm there with friends or family we get treated so well. I've come to know the employees and I've made many magician friends who I truly love being around. They're a different breed. They just want to practice their craft for people who appreciate the art and love seeing them perform. I thoroughly enjoy being there and seeing magic tricks that defy reality right in front of my face. The magicians get a kick out of us being there as much as we love being there too! It's a win-win. If you get the chance to go - make it worthwhile! You're gonna have a blast.",5 star rating
493,8/15/2015,"Overall, the magic was pretty cool and the food was good, but it's almost like an obligatory event you must go to if you have the chance, but it's not that great. In fact, it could be a waste of money for you.Valet was $13, entrance is $30, and dinner is likely to be $50 per person and lots of the magic maybe 50% seems rigged in some shape or form. I ean what magic isn't? Anyway, the people they pick for the magic semm to be part of the castle. The preemptive magic gets old quick. I mean I don't know how some of it works, but I liked the magic with the cards and coins the most.I think it was borderline waste-of-time, but a little bit more on the plus side, thus 3 stars. Some of the magic was bomb and the food quality is great. Customer service nice as well. Take your pick if you want to go or not. It might be for you. Don't forget the dress code.",3 star rating
494,10/3/2017,"What an amazing experience - if you have a chance to go here, take it!ENTERTAINMENT:We saw three shows, Jimmy Ichihara, Randy Gastreich, and David Zirbel.Jimmy Ichihana was AMAZING!  His card tricks were very mathematical and fun to watch up close.  Randy Gastreich was also great, he was very funny and charismatic, seemed more like a comedy routine than a magic show!The after dinner show however was way too cheesy; watching a girl get cut in half was cool I guess but I definitely preferred the earlier shows.  They have a magic piano, named Irma, if you tip her she can apparently play any song you want, we didn't get a chance to test that though. :(FOOD:The food and drinks were amazing - I tried the magic moment champagne and their sangria, and had the thai curry crab bisque and scallops for dinner.  I highly recommend the thai curry crab bisque, it was so delicious!Also they offer free bread, so take advantage of that, and ask the waiter to show you the wine cork trick at the table!Overall, this was a great experience and wasn't at all as expensive as I was anticipating.  Entrance is $25-30.  Entrees are around $40.  Drinks weren't too high.",5 star rating
495,6/3/2016,"The main 8pm SHOW was outstanding, so so funny.The dinner menu was like old skool hotel, NYC, London esque vibe.- The Seafood Louis Salad was good, except it was missing carrots, red onions, etc. it just had lettuce, thousand island dressing and some tomatoes, avocadoes and the seafood (although the seafood quality and portion was great)- The CRAB Thai Lobster Bisque was not that great- Prime Rib was amazing- Scallops with bacon jam was outstanding- the Garlic Cheese bread was pricy, 6 pcs @ $10 but TASTY!The desserts were 2 out of 3. The marscapone chocolate raspberry thing was a hit. The banana cream pie was a home run. The creme Brulee was sub par, made in advance so the crust/top suffered.It was crowded, noisy, and had so much stuff going on. It was a fun night.",4 star rating
496,1/9/2017,"one of my absolute favorites!!!i am completely obsessed with this place.anytime i am offered to come here, i can never say NO and neither should you if you have the invite!!Magic Castle brings together all the things I actually like about Hollywood: exclusive entry, glam (suit & tie required for men and women dolled up), amazing dinner and magic! what else can i ask for?let me start by saying, very exclusive so you need to be a member or know someone in the castle. AMBIANCEi have been here many times and each time, i am in awe with this place. Spooky, mysterious and magical. The castle's design and decor is spellbinding. it`s a bizarre set up with unique theatres. some smaller than others. i don`t mind getting lost here anyday. the smaller rooms are called CLOSE UP GALLERY.  if you get a chance, check out some close up magic at the round felt tables scattered throughout. love the intimacy of these!FOODPricey and well worth it. Almost anything i tried in their menu is good! this visit, i had the Rosemary chicken served au gratin potatoes and vegetables! yummm!!full bar so i have endless amount of champagne.only NEGATIVE thing about the castle is that you can not take photos once inside the castle. in the world of technology and in my Yelp world, it`s hard not to capture this magical experience and yummy food. but i get it and that`s why i love the exclusivity of this place. you`d have to go to experience it, enjoy it in person instead of watching it on social media.Valet parking available.I have never seen the same magic more than once and it is always an amazing experience!!!",5 star rating
497,5/30/2015,"Love love love!  I can't wait to come back here again!  When we had reservations here we were required to have dinner reservations so we chose to do it at 6:00 to give us enough time to see the shows and explore the castle.  Like everyone said no pictures pass the lobby.  There was a $30 entrance fee per person.  Hostess was friendly and they gave me a birthday badge! I felt so special!The only reason I give this amazing establishment a 4 star is because their dinner is nothing impressive and it kind of hurts me to say that.  Dinner was generic and ok.  There was nothing spectacular or special that would make the food stand out.  I was actually expecting my waiter to pull a trick on me but nope, just a regular waiter.  They saw that it was my birthday so I had the choice of either cheesecake, chocolate cake, or glasses of champagne.  After dinner they hand you a ticket to a select show to get priority seating.  I was a little sad that the ticket we were handed wasn't for the main show but I didn't realize that until later on.My favorite theater was definitely the Close-Up Theater.  It was super cramp and intimate but the magic was unbelievable.  I was literally right in the front and I can't believe what he did in front of my eyes.Always line up for the shows ahead of time.  They have limited seating and to make the most out of the experience you should at least see 3 shows.  I saw a lot of people get turned away because there was not enough room and people were pissed. I don't blame them.  Don't forget to see the Irma, the ghost pianist.  She can play any song you request which is amazing and she's super friendly.  It's an amazing experience to come here so jump at the opportunity when it presents itself.",4 star rating
498,7/13/2017,"Went for my birthday with my friends... no Houdini no David Blaine, just some abracadabra and some lames.  Definitely overrated and hyped like a mother!  The Castle-The castle is old but cool. Think Queen Mary meets Disneys tower of terror. Or what I imagine  the Adams family house might be like. Definitely no Hogwarts though! Dress code- They are sticklers for the dumbest things. You will see people get away with inappropriate attire and than others not so much. A bit biased towards women that were not in dresses. They wanted me to change into some loaner heels even though I was wearing dress shoes. ::Shrugs:: Suit + tie for men & dress + heels for women, don't try to be different lol you will get denied access! The Staff + Service  The staff is nice, I enjoyed the customer service and friendly environment of the people that work there. I left magical tips all evening. Food-You each have to buy an entree, no cheaper than $45 bucks plus drinks etc. our party of 4 footed a $400 bill just at dinner. Drinks are good not gonna lie! Food is quality of BJs. Definitely expected better for price tag ::shrugs:: no magic there lolWe ordered salmon, filet minion, chicken and albacore (if you want the most food for your buck get the chicken)The Actual Magic-We saw 2 shows the first was a magician named Voronin. Worst show ever! Poor acting, clownery, and ailing magic props. Seen better magic at Venice beach. The next show was short like 20 minutes but amazing! Mostly just card tricks and coin tricks. Long lines. Most shows are over by the time you finish dinner... didn't really like that particular trick. Go early if you can to catch more shows (early meaning 6pm). Ask the staff what you're looking to see for show recommendations. The End-I left feeling underwhelmed, there were no rabbits being pulled out of hats, no disappearing lady, no man being sawed in half. On top of the $450 bill, additional drinks throughout the night, and $20 entrance fee for each of us the only thing sawed in half was my wallet *_*",2 star rating

503,4/20/2015,"The Magic Castle is so magical! I mean duh of course it is, but by that I mean this place is really cool.First, you apparently have to be invited in to the Magic Castle by magicians or members or whatever... talk about exclusive! The mean girls club for magicians. So awesome. Somehow my friends and I got in, because someeehow one of them got a month-long membership.. So that was cool, but it'll probably be the only time I'll ever get in! I'm just not running with the right crowds you know lol.So I think dinner is mandatory (I could be wrong) and you have to make a reservation for a certain time slot. We went on a Tuesday night, and had dinner rez for 8 PM. The ""magic show"" is actually a bunch of different short shows that you can catch, and there's also one ""main show"" (aka a longer show? lol). I thought it would just be one big ass show (say the word show one more time) but nope! This is actually much cooler cos you get to see things more up-close and personal.We caught a short magic show before dinner and a bunch after, and there are also straggler magicians (for lack of better term) that hang out in lil booths/couches that also perform some REAL up-close cool magic. So try to make it to all the shows for the full experience! Some of the tricks really blew my mind. BooooshhhDinner was freakin bombbbbbbbbb. I ordered the prime rib ""cajun style"" (which I think is prime rib grilled with cajun seasoning?)... and man it was so good. So flavorful and tender mmmmmm. I think everyone had a good dinner, and most people ordered the prime rib so that's my rec for ya! Get it cajun style medium rare ;) If you like it REALLY rare then maybe don't get cajun style lol.Also their coconut crab bisque? was TASTY! Get it all! Food was bomb.So that's that! Really cool place, try to go when you can because honestly this ish is too exclusive for you to just pass up on it like nbd.",5 star rating

505,1/15/2017,"Never again. It was kind of cool, but it's completely over priced and overrated.  Have been there several times. This time was the worst.  You can't take photos anywhere except out by where the valet is, even if the photos aren't in a a show area or anywhere near them.  They made me delete photos of the steak, and of my friends that I hadn't seen in years.  Probably won't go back for a long time if ever, I have never been to a place where I spend $467 plus $45 a head cover charge there were six of us (so $270).  And then we decided to not go to the show and wanted to sit at our table after our meal and talk with our friends for a few minutes, we were asked by the waitress to please get up from the table because she needed to seat other people.  Really?! C'mon!   Unbelievable.      There are much better dining and entertaining venues in Los Angeles that cost a fraction of the price.  Save your hard earned money go somewhere else and have better food for less and get treated with respect and apprection rather than disdain.         If you couldn't tell from this long winded review I am not satisfied with my experience at this business.  Enjoy my money Magic Castle because you'll never get another penny and will share my experience with others.",1 star rating

507,5/7/2016,"Went to the castle again for an early Mother's Day brunch with friends and had the absolute best time - my mom said it was one of her best Mother's Day's!I am so glad we made the choice to come early at 11:30 - we were able to catch 3 shows before our brunch (in The Museum, the Close-Up Gallery, and Parlor Room).  Two of those were with junior magicians and they were absolutely charming and amazing!  We got to see Austin and Franco and they were the highlights of the night!  Employees were friendly and went out of their way more than once, ensuring that guests were able to attend as many shows as possible, offering standing room and floor seating when shows were crowded.We had 1:30 lunch reservations ($40 brunch, plus $20 entrance fee/each).  Honestly, well worth it.  The brunch was actually good - lots of options: shrimp, ceviche, prime rib, eggs, omelets, pasta, kids options: chicken tenders and fries & a great array of desserts.  Something for everyone.  Our waiter was charming, funny, and great.  And we got tickets to the 2:45pm Palace of Mystery show which was about 45 minutes.  Every show we saw was different and wonderful in it's own way.  Some of the shows were directed more to kids (since there were lots of kids present) which was still very entertaining for adults to watch and great to see the kids enjoying themselves.Honestly, The Magic Castle is now one of my favorite places in LA.  Everyone who works there is so nice and friendly.  Great for locals and tourists.  Great for special occasions or when you just want to have an extraordinary night.  You feel like you are part of the club and not like you are in an amusement park.  There is a true vibe of reverence for the art of magic and it feels like guests are invited to enjoy and celebrate that.  Valet parking is $13/car or you can park at the Hollywood & Highland lot and shuttle to the castle - but if you are at the castle for hours (which you SHOULD be!) then it's not much of a difference - I think 4 hours at the H&H lot with validation is $10 so I recommend just valet parking and enjoying the overall experience.",5 star rating
508,6/24/2015,"Second time at The Magic Castle for a college alumn event so this might be a bit differing from other peoples experiences. I can blog about my first visit to TMC in another review which will be an experience moreso which everyone would likely share.In summation, I had a great time!!! What's not to love about all of my experience below?Parking: Reserve via ParkMe.com to park at The Roosevelt Hotel--it is only $5 for the night on a weekday, not sure how much it costs on a weekend. But this sure trumps a $13 valet parking fee any day. Plus, it's literally across the street or straight up Orange until you hit Hollywood Blvd, a good 3-5 minute walk which beats waiting in your car on that hill to valet for 10-15 minutes. And, you won't have to wait for valet to fetch your car for a good 15-20 minute wait while everyone is rushing to head home after a long, fun night, all at the same time.Eats: We were privileged to have the ""Inner Circle"" room downstairs all reserved for our large group and our large group only. This room downstairs has its only private bar so you are not waiting in a long line of drunkards waiting to order your drink and the bartenders are gregarious and tell jokes as well. We even had a 5-minute conversation about all the wines he was serving: Culina, Cabs, Pinots (sold-out, so ask for this first), and another white which wasn't as good as the Culina (more $$$).Mini shrimp cocktail served w a lemon: Not the juiciest and super tiny, looked a bit dehydrated. Maybe they should marinate the shrimp in butter or such beforehand? Skip or just grab one or two. Costco does it better.Spinach dip  w bruschetta toast: It was very gravy like with little meatballs in the dip; it's alright--it went nicely with the little empanada like  h'orderves the waitors passed around on a platterCrabcakes: These were delish and tasted up to Costco quality standards. So much crab in every bite and very little breading atop. The thousand-island esque salad dressing atop paired nicely.Palace Magic Show: This was just reserved for our group and our magician (oh dear) of whom I cannot recall his name was extremely likeable as he had a boyish charm and no snootiness about him despite being a magician at THE Magic Castle. He told so many jokes poking fun at himself and made the entire audience laugh throughout the show. I loved his tricks so much more than the last time I visited--he made 2-3 birds appear out of nowhere, he washed the birds, played with fire, and did various mind games with the audience using the books Twilight and 50-Shades of Grey. Yeah... hah. It was my favorite performance and performer for the night!Close-Up Gallery: This room fits only about 20-people so line up at least 15-20 minutes ahead of time. It is in the downstairs bar area before you head upstairs to grab dinner and there is another bar right in front. Down down stairs is the area where magicians do little tricks at dealers tables. We had a magician from Spain. Was he really visiting from Spain just for this performance?! I wonder.... He did a bunch of card tricks such as guessing the card an audience member is thinking of. He chose 2-guests from the audience to sit on his right and left side and help him throughout the show. I just wonder if those were random or if it was rehearsed. I wanted to be picked last time and this time but I've never been picked! So I shall not know til then...We were tired and sleepy around 10pm and headed home for the night afterwards.",3 star rating
509,3/11/2017,"Love the experience, hate the way they squeeze money out of you.Alright so here's the deal: It's near impossible to get an invite to the Castle. Everyone says ""Oh, it's so easy. Six degrees of separation. I'm sure you know SOMEONE, yada yada yada."" They're wrong. It is insanely hard!! I reached out to like 15 magicians who were performing in the upcoming weeks to ask if they would be willing to put four people on the guest list. I even personalized all the messages by watching all their available YouTube videos and explaining the things I liked about their act, etc. Only ONE magician responded to me and they said their performances were full. So, that was a total bust.Miraculously, my roommate knew a magician from her high school and she reached out to him on facebook and after a few weeks of no response, he FINALLY wrote her back saying that we could have an invitation!! Here are the details: -The invitation is good for you + 5 guests (6 people total).-You still have to pay a cover charge ($20 on weekdays, $30 on weekends).-You must make reservations for dinner. You have to give them your credit card information when you make the reservation. If you or any of your guests don't show up, they charge your card $25 per person that doesn't show.-You are required to get an entree at dinner. Each entree is around $40. They do offer a salad option that is $28. They do not serve bread at the table (bummer, right?)-Drinks are around $14. -They charge a hefty amount for valet. Best to take a lyft.-Most of the dinner reservations will already be full (we called a few weeks in advance and the only thing open was a Thursday night at 9:45!), but it's okay because you can get to the castle as early as you want and leave as late as you want. You don't have to come at exactly the time of your reservation.Anyway, to sum up: invitation or not, you are gonna spend a TON of money. Now on to the good stuff:-LOVE the classic black tie vibe. It makes you feel special and like you're transported to another time.-The staff is EXTREMELY friendly. Even though you've already spent too much money, they make you want to tip them much more than required! They're fantastic and they definitely make you feel special.-The magic was awesome! It's so fun because everyone is there to have a good time. No one is making fun of the magic or the magicians. It's not a joke, it's exciting and impressive. It's fun to buy into the whimsy of it all!-Not to mention, It's cool to feel like you're a part of something exclusive!Once you're inside, make friends with magicians who are sitting around the bar or hanging out (not necessarily the ones who are performing). We did and not only did he show us some impressive tricks, but he gave us a TON of guest passes so we can come back!! And, we will DEFINITELY be back!",4 star rating
510,1/13/2016,"Ahhhhh so pricy but worth every penny. This is a magnificent place to be and at least experience once in your lifetime. Make sure you know someone who can get you in, because that's the hardest part. Luckily, a good friend of mine used to be a magician here so he got me in plus 5! The entire venue is so unique and interesting. First there is a door well hidden, but say the magic phrase ""open sesame"" and it will open up!! You'll go through a series of hallways and rooms to see different shows, each funny and interesting in their own way.There is a piano that plays any song you ask it to, apparently there is an old lady sitting on it. Be nice to her! LOL The food is OK. Like I said it's expensive, but the experience is worth every penny :)",5 star rating
511,7/25/2018,"This is, by far, the coolest thing we did on our most recent trip to LA. I did magic as a child and have known about the Magic Castle for decades, but I figured I would never be able to experience it for myself. Before our recent trip, though, I realized I did have a friend who'd been a professional magician for many years. Although he's not a member, he had a friend who was happily generous enough to provide a guest pass to me. I made the reservation for four of us and received an email with all the pertinent info. It's a dress-up establishment; men must wear coats and ties, while ladies wear cocktail/semi-formal attire. I actually like this a lot; it's rare these days that we dress up for things, and being in this 100-year-old mansion with beautiful, sharp-dressed people made the experience feel like an Oscar party.No photos are allowed inside the Castle, but that is again a refreshing change from the norm. It is a beautiful place, filled with amazing magic relics and awesome antiques...and it's HUGE. We had a delicious meal, served by a fun, friendly and knowledgeable server. Then we were free to wander the place, stopping at any of the varied performance spaces. You might sit across a table from a guy doing close-up coin magic. Or you might enter an 80-seat theater to watch Piff the Magic Dragon, a hilarious and profane performance that had me roaring with laughter. In the basement were some cool displays, including a working model of the Disneyland Haunted Mansion's dancing ghost illusion. Another case held photos and memorabilia of Johnny Carson's early career as a boy magician.We spent almost four hours at the Magic Castle and didn't come close to seeing everything there is to see. We were charmed and thrilled with the experience and I definitely won some cool-points with my daughter for getting us all into this amazing place. If you can figure a way to get admitted, this should definitely be at the top of your LA To-Do list.",5 star rating

514,12/5/2016,"This so-called ""exclusive club"" was a BIG let down. They are stricter than the WHITE HOUSE !!! I was wearing a nice and formal romper with a jacket that had a zipper, the girl in the front told me I had to check in my jacket because of the zipper...ok...  I took off my jacket and gave to her. Then she saw my romper and said ""you need to wear a skirt because you're wearing shorts"". No, I'm wearing a romper, so I had to go to the back and put on some skirt that looked like it was from a dead lady 100 years ago and who knows how long ago its been washed. Ok, magic castle already gave me a bad first impression at the entrance.Onto the food. Service was so slowwww. Took us an HOUR to get our food and it wasn't even worth the money we had to spend. The best tasting of the night was my friend's prime rib so I suggest that. Now the shows: I was expecting something AMAZING being this is the magic castle and all... but NOPE! Their magic was like something you see on the streets.. for free. Would I come back? NO THANKS. I'll take my $30 entrance fee, the $13 valet fee, my $50 dinner plus drinks elsewhere.",1 star rating
515,12/28/2016,"As far as entertainment, this place is pretty darn cool!! I finally remembered to use my invitation and reserved about 1.5 months prior to when I wanted to go. Even at 1.5 months, my choices for Saturday dinner was either really early or somewhat late. I opted for the 9:45 pm dinner (btw, dinner is mandatory) and to try to catch a couple shows prior. I really enjoyed the ambiance and vibe of this dress to impress place; it was pretty magical lol. Some of the rooms get packed quickly, so line up 30-45 minutes before the show you want to catch...the small rooms seat 28 and the others about 56. I was able to get into one of the small rooms after capacity since they allow one person per step to stand during the show. All of the shows we watched (excluding the holiday show) was about 20 minutes long. If you can't get into a room, don't fear, there are other shows around the castle at tables and bars. One of the magicians we watched at the bar usually appears in the close-up gallery as well; he was awesome!! I'm still in awe with some of the close up magic. lol. Don't come expecting to see anyone cut in half though. As for the food (3 stars), it wasn't that great. I guess it was OKAY (hence the 4 star review instead of 5). BEWARE: They ask if you want cheese bread, we said yes, and were charged. We were actually charged for 2 orders of bread since we asked for seconds (one basket for a party of 6 wasn't enough). I got the Beef Wellington and felt the meat wasn't tender nor moist. The veggies and potatoes it came with were good, but for $40 I had higher expectations. This place really gets you on the mandatory dinner and mediocre food.Expenses:-$13 valet -$30 entry per person (for Saturday; weekdays is $20)-dinner: roughly $60 per person (excluding alcohol)-drinks: roughly $27 for 2 mixed drinks, $8 for beer.

I've eaten dinner and brunch at the Magic Castle. Both those meals tasted delicious, we were quite satisfied and full.The history of the building  and the historic pictures was very interesting. There is an identical building in Redlands.All the shows were entertaining and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I highly recommend visiting if you have the chance.",5 star rating

518,2/14/2015,"Hello, writing to update.  About 3 weeks after the incident (where one of our tires was irreparably damaged while in the hands of the valet service), we received a check from the Magic Castle for 50% of the tire.  That is what we were asking for the day of the incident when the valet driver was accusing us of causing the damage.  Ultimately they did the right thing, paid for half the tire; which was we proposed the day of the incident.  We think they only did it because of the negative yelp review as the yelp review was mentioned in the email correspondence back/forth while we were trying to get the check for the tire repair.We feel like they did resolve the issue, but would have been so much better if they handled it differently from the beginning.  They never acknowledged the inconvenience for us and maintained that it was our fault.A ""sorry this happened to you while we were responsible for your vehicle"" would have gone a long way instead of accusations from the beginning.We will still not be going back; but they did resolve the issue in the end.",2 star rating

520,7/20/2016,"This is one of my favorite places and fondest memory of my life. Upon arrival, everything already feels like a dream. The Magic Castle is exquisite from the inside and out. If you have the honor of being invited make sure to wear your best cocktail dress and high heels. Gentlemen, suit and tie up! Their website has strict rules and guidelines for attire if you are unsure what to wear.When you enter, be mindful of the steep slope to valet and keep a good distance away from the car in front you. Another note, there is no self-parking. There is absolutely no pictures to be taken beyond the lobby. This is a fine establishment/ historic-cultural monument. Respect it and leave this beautiful place the mystery it is. I mean, you're there to keep secrets. The entire staff is very welcoming, attentive, and friendly. There is more than one bar area, make sure to order from each one! Each space is unique and sometimes has a magician performing magic tricks. They have excellent spirits and delicious cocktails. There is a lot going on even outside of the magic shows, magicians walking around performing tricks here and there, and tables with more magicians for viewing pleasure. All the shows are interactive with the audience. You get to become apart of the entire experience. If you're shy, you won't be anymore. All the magicians are not only talented, however they are also extremely charming. They will leave you in an intrepidation of being stunned and swept away in joyful laughter. Their talent exceeds anything your heart can imagine. It truly is greater than any film, novel, or secondhand story ever told. I'll leave the rest for you to find out ;)",5 star rating

524,4/1/2018,"Wow!  Be forewarned that the place is jammed so my opinion isn't in the mainstream on this. But I found this experience to be dreadful. For starters, it's expensive.  I'm not price sensitive, but when add up the price of admission, the expensive dinner, and the pricy drinks, it gets to a big number. Add to that their restrictive dress code, and the magic part had better be great. It wasn't. They told us the guy is the bar was astounding (one piece of paper trick in twenty minutes). The main show was just cheesy. The two acts were hokey, and the seats were those cheap hotel seats that get so u comfortable as you sit through a performance you wish you could fast forward through. If there's a disappearing act I need, it's to take an expensive, boring evening and make the whole thing disappear.",1 star rating
525,3/18/2016,"I've been wanting to visit the Magic Castle for a long time, so when my fiancé told me he could get us in, I was so excited. From the moment you walk, you are transported to a magical place. We went early so we could see as many shows as possible. The magic was pretty great. It was mostly card tricks, so don't expect people disappearing in thin air. I think that was the most disappointing part. By the end of the night, I was so over card tricks...it began to get repetitive.As for the dinner, it was AMAZING. I cannot stress enough how delicious the food was. We got the seared ahi tuna and the Cobb salad to start. For our meals, we both ordered the 14 oz rib eye which was the best steak I have ever had. It definitely beats Mastro's. We got the lobster mash and the sautéed mushrooms for our sides. As you can tell for two people, it's a lot of food, so we definitely had left overs. They store your left overs in the kitchen and you pick it up before you leave which is cool because you don't have to carry the box around. My only complaint is they rip you off with their alcohol. I ordered a Moscow Mule and they literally put no alcohol in it. My fiancé got a Jack and coke, which was mostly coke. I would just be mindful of that when ordering an alcoholic drink from any of their bars.",4 star rating

528,3/23/2015,"I've been wanting to come here for some time, but you have to know someone who knows someone to get in.  Yesterday was finally that day.I was told to be at the Castle by 5pm - this is when they open.  We did not have dinner reservations so that we would get a chance to do a lot more things.  If we had sat for dinner, we would have easily been there for 2+ hours and maybe saw only a couple of things or just one show.We got a chance to see two Close-Up Gallery shows.  We all left before the third act in the Close-Up Gallery which was starting at 10 since it was Sunday and we all had to work on Monday.  We also got a chance to see a show in the Parlour of Prestidigitation.  We did not see anything in the big theater since most in there had dinner reservations (one of the perks of having dinner reservations).There are so many rooms and hallways in the Castle.  We ended up in a bar in one of the hallways where we grabbed a quick bite in between shows.  Most of the performances spaces allows drinks but no food.We also got a quick show from the member that invited us in a space down in the basement.There is a little room behind the main bar in the front where there is a player piano. You can make requests from the ghost to play songs, as long as you tip!Valet is $17 + tip.  I did notice people were generally tipping before when dropping off their cars and after when picking up.No pictures are allowed inside the Castle.  Take as many as you want outside.  Adults only, men must be in suit, tie and jacket, women must be in cocktail attire or pantsuit with jacket.  Basically don't be a slob.  Dress up for a nice night out.Schedule changes each week, but honestly, even the most 'junior' acts were still pretty amazing.",4 star rating
529,7/8/2015,"OMG amazing!  I had the fortune of coming here on a guest list and bypassed some of the rules (did not have dinner).  I saw and met some amazing performers, including a performer who was just stopping by and gave us an impromptu side show which was also breathtaking (will be checking out David Minkin's own show soon, was super impressed).  I loved the drink I got (Bulldog Bite), and the bar food was actually really good (cheesy garlic bread, veggie flatbread, calamari and truffle fries).  The fries were probably my least favorite because of the cut, but they were good after being dipped in the calamari sauce.  Lindsay Benner's glowing balls were magical, musical, and mesmerizing.  (That sentence would sound a lot less pervy if you were there.)Johnny Ace Palmer was on point.I saw baby chicks and a rabbit.  That adds at least 1 star to this review.Valet $13.  I looked into parking at a nearby hotel (Roosevelt using parkme.com), but it was $10, and I didn't feel like hiking up the hill in my heels.I will definitely be back.",5 star rating

We got there as soon as the doors opened and stayed all night until around midnight. We saw most of the shows that were available and they were all impressive.

Whattttt?! :) Anyway, I am taking off 1 star because everytime I call to make a reservation/ask a question, the lady who picks up the phone has been very rude. Even upon checking in at the desk in the lobby, the lady would give off a very pretentious attitude. I never received a ""welcome"" or hello. Besides that part, I really love the Magic Castle. I was lucky to have been here three times so far and I can't wait to come back again and again. Tip: come on Fridays. It is less crowded than Saturdays and therefore much more enjoyable.

532,3/14/2015,"Going to the Magic Castle has been on my LA to-do list for quite some time. Finally I was able to check this off my list!!So yes the dress code is enforced but since I'm not coming here too often it was nice to get dressed up and enjoy myself. An invitation is required in order to come here. Luckily we happen to know a couple of members so we were able to get our party of 6 in and enjoy dinner before the shows began. Food: I don't think the food is that bad but for the $$ it seems expensive. I enjoyed an end cut of prime rib for my entree. I've had better, more flavorful cuts of prime rib but this wasn't too bad. It just didn't justify the cost of the meal. So for food: 3 stars.Obviously what our group was more interested in was the magic. We were able to sit in the front row of the main show. What a fantastic experience! Magic on tv just isn't the same as witnessing it live especially on the main stage. What our group really liked were the close-up shows. The shows seemed more impromptu and way more intimate. Combine entertaining magic with some adult beverages and the magic is a strong 5 stars!Overall I really enjoyed my experience at the Magic Castle. Since I'm no high roller you won't see me here often. As a SoCal resident for over 15 years visiting the Magic Castle is a must. So save up the extra scratch, get dressed up, and if you're lucky enough to get an invite then go do what LA people do and visit the Magic Castle.",4 star rating
533,12/2/2012,"Are you a fan of magic? What about being amazed? Wanna be surprised? This truly is your place to go!!! I definitely have not been anywhere quite like this!  Being able to come here is pretty difficult. Thanks to a fellow yelper he helped my boyfriend and my wish come true. We were so excited to come here to see what all of the hype was about. Took my boyfriend here to celebrate his belated birthday. It is pretty difficult to get a reservation for dinner on any weekend. Sundays seem to be An easier night to get. the only downfall is you'll suffer the next day when you gotta wake up for work. *you gotta valet your car. if you have a fixed up lowered car i would not recommend it. to exit the lot its a bit steep. so it might damage your car.so bring your beater! bring tip money for the valet guys! they are quick and super well mannered. right when we pulled up the guy opened my bf car door and the back door and grabbed his coat out and helped him put it on. [so they take the dress code thing seriously!!]*you gotta pay extra for entry fee. $20 bucks a head. you can pay for the entry fee and valet all at once. *you gotta eat dinner there. Dinner: Appetizer: crispy calamari -tasted good; you just gotta ask for extra lemon to give it the right kick! Entree: my boyfriend and I got the prime rib medium 12 oz. and An 8 oz. filet of beef  aka filet mignon. everything was made exactly medium as requested. prime rib tasted better than the filet mignon. i had to dip both of the meat into the au ju sauce to give it flavor.Extra: cream corn- it came out cold. a bit watery and sweet. we didn't have expectations on food because i was warned by yelpers. However, service here was top notch! Everyone made sure we were happy during our dining experience. They kept asking us if everything was ok. The dining area has a history to it as well. The location where my bf &I were placed was in an old bedroom. The servers is very knowledgeable about the history here.there's a bar like in every room. one guy was super drunk he couldn't get up. he had to be escorted out. don't do that to yourself especially at a place like this. if you're gonna drink. drink just a little not till you're unable to walk. there's plenty of restrooms as well throughout the castle. also there's plenty of exit signs. so i felt safe and comfortable to know that if something would've happened i would be able to escape quick! this place is seriously like a maze. girls you gotta dress up in a cocktail dress or suit. i wore heels and my feet were killing me. so if you're a non high heel wearer. then opt to flats. that was my mistake.fellas you gotta wear a with suit plus tie. or wear dress pants, dress shirt, jacket and a tie. you decide.we had a really good experience here and can't wait to come back. luckily we met a magician who provided us with a business card who stated that he is willing to give us an invite to come back. you gotta seriously wait like 45 minutes early for each show in order to secure a seat and a good seat at that. the rooms are small and very intimate. which we loved! we were able to see everything. If you wanna participate with the magicians then make sure you sit at the front. we got to see Puck (a semi finalist) from America's Got Talent. He was super good! We watched the BIG/main show and that was the best.all in all, it was a great experience and we would recommend it to anybody that could go! we're alrEady looking forward to our return back to the Magic Castle.Get ready to be WOWed!",4 star rating

Every where you look there is memorabilia a story to be told if you take the time to look.  For sure if you get a chance you have to  go. Yes it is pricey but it's a day/night to remember.

539,10/24/2016,"One word: *yawn*We were invited by one of the magicians and I was so excited to be able to finally experience the Magic Castle, the oh-so-exclusive Magic Castle. We arrived and went inside to the front desk where the rude and tired looking hostess charged us $30 per person to enter and $13 for valet, once we paid we were able to go inside and get to dinner.The reason I didn't give this a 1 star is because I enjoyed their food. We ordered the rib eye, filet, and artichoke spinach dip and it was delicious. The bill came out to $112 (we didn't drink so it was a very fair price)After dinner we went to our show, waited 45 min to enter and 30 min more once we were inside -- this is the part I was excited for since I LOVE magic.To make a very long, boring, story short, my 5 year old nephew can do better magic than the magicians. They were funny and entertaining but they made so many mistakes and you could easily see the ""hidden"" strings and other gadgets to create the illusions. It was very disappointing and I was very let down. I almost wish I hadn't come only to preserve that ""wow"" factor I had in my mind of the magic castle.The only Magic they're good at is cleaning out your wallet with nothing of substance in returnWill not be coming back, I'll take my money to Vegas.",2 star rating
540,12/10/2014,"My friend invited me and a group of our friends for a night at The Magic Castle.   I imagined that we would have to drive up a long road up to the tip top of a hill.  But no, it's just right off Franklin. The castle looks super cool outside and the interior is amazing! Parking is valet only.  The staff is super nice and funny.  No pictures past the lobby.  Bummer!  We went to two mini shows before our scheduled dinner at 9:45 PM.  The mini shows are in small, little rooms.  I wish the magician would hold up their props (i.e. cards), so that people in the back could see what the heck they're doing. Since we came for the last scheduled dinner, we saw the mini and big shows with the same group of people.  There were some guests who were extremely obnoxious and annoying.  I have the understanding that everyone is 21+ but some people were acting so childish.  It was hard to hear what the magician was trying to say because he had to keep talking OVER people.  I was starving by the time we got to dinner.  The menu primarily consists of steak, chicken, and fish entrees.  I had the prime rib, medium rare with a side of chipotle mac and cheese.  The prime rib had no flavor whatsoever.  It was tender.  The au jus had no taste and the only thing that saved the prime rib was the horseradish.  I was only able to eat half of my entree.  My hubs steak was slightly better in flavor but we didn't finish either entrees.  Between the two of us, we paid $115.  The magic was A-OK but nothing spectacular.  I was expecting it to rock my socks!  There was a juggling act, some cards tricks, and they made my best friend's wedding ring disappear and reappear in a sealed M&M bag.  The latter was the coolest.  The big show felt so short!  45 minutes with two magicians.I'm really glad I got to experience The Magic Castle at least once.  It's a great experience but probably not one that I would want to see again.",3 star rating
541,10/2/2017,"This is great historical location that I finally got the opportunity to visit, though I've lived in Los Angeles my whole life. To get into the Magic Castle, you must be a member or invited by a member. There is a strict dress code and no photo policy past the lobby. There are so many nooks and crannies to explore within the castle that you don't know what's hidden behind the next corner. We enjoyed the magicians located by the main bar and the bar downstairs. There are scheduled magic shows in the main theaters that you can attend as well. The restaurant was very good despite the initial fishy aromas we smelt when we first walked by it. The server was very knowledgeable and friendly and kept us on schedule for the show we were scheduled to attend. The food is a bit pricey but along the same lines as a upscale steakhouse and the meals were not disappointing.I can't wait to be invited back as we had so much fun!",4 star rating

543,3/22/2018,"Gotta love the Magic Castle. The ambiance is always great. The bar drinks are always good and the dinner is top notch. I love their cheese bread appetizer. The filet mignon is delicious and pretty much any side dishes are great. Excellent  desserts. I have never had one complaint about their food. And the magic shows are the best. Always a different variety of entertainment.  Magicians from all over. If your lucky to get invited, don't hesitate. I've gone 5 times now and looking forward to the next. Sunday brunch is the best. Had my daughter's 10th birthday party there. Kids love it. It's adults only except for Sunday brunch.",5 star rating
544,9/18/2017,"I finally made it to the Magic Castle thanks to a friend. It was a magical evening of exploration, side shows, dinner, and main attractions. Of the many acts we saw, I highly recommend seeing Paul Green and Martin Lewis although you'll probably have a different slate of magicians when you go as they change every week. Dinner is on the pricier side but it turned out to be pretty decent fare. I got the lamb which came with two large pieces and roasted side vegetables. I was pretty stuffed. With dinner came tickets for the magic show in the Palace of Mystery. My friend stayed later and told me about a mentalist type of act in the lower level of the castle. I'd say it's a fun experience if you've never gone before. It's like an amusement park of magicians so plan to stand in a few short lines to see acts and look for magicians doing their magic tucked in niches all over the castle.",4 star rating

546,11/12/2016,I was very excited to go to the Magic Castle.  I had heard about it for years and it was a massive letdown.  After paying $30 to get in and $20 a drink we went to one of the shows before dinner. It was veterans week which featured magicians that we all vets.  The first magician was very inappropriate. In a 20 minute show he made over 20 sexual jokes that made everyone uncomfortable. He messed up his big trick and then told the crowd he didn't care because he was drunk. We then had dinner. Everything was overpriced and the entrees were not worth the money. The service was good but that is about it. We saw a show after dinner.  It was the worst magic show I've ever seen. I was expecting a 10 and this was a 2 at best.  The whole experience was a bust.  We spoke to an employee after the show and he said it was veterans week so it wasn't their best people. I support veterans but when I am spending over $500 for the night between dinner and drinks and entry fee I expect them to tell us ahead of time that the magic won't be good.  This was a big fail in my opinion.,2 star rating
547,7/5/2017,"It is always a treat to come here! The buffet is like nothing you have gotten before. Everything is so good. The perfect time is 10:30 as the line gets super long and does move slowly at the 10:45 mark. You get a wide assortment of foods. I had a half bagel with lox, crab legs (YUMMY), potatoes, scrambled eggs, and more. Bottomless mimosas that the waiters are quick to give you refills! The shows are great too, super entertaining. I can't wait to go back again :)",5 star rating
548,11/4/2014,"When you think of magic and wizards what is the first thing that comes to your mind? I'm willing to bet it is Harry Potter right?! Well since the outside of this place resembles a castle it will instantly remind you of it but this is no Hogwarts....this is the Magic Castle. Important INFO: -Parking is valet only.-Dress code is strictly enforced, guys bring out our suits and gals wear your dresses! There are only two ways to experience the magic here, one way is to have a guest card from a member and eating dinner or by getting invited by someone who is a member. I was lucky enough to be invited by one of my friends (Thanks Shanon Y. and Nelson!!) to attend a Saturday night performance. As you enter you must speak the secret password to an owl that is sitting on one of the bookshelves. A hidden door slides opens and you're in!The closest thing I can compare the interior design to is probably the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. This place does something special though, you definitely get the vibe that you are transported back in time to an era where technology did not take over and when people actually interacted with each other face to face, it is a good change in pace and makes it experience feel more intimate. There are plenty of bars scattered around the mansion which is nice because you don't have to walk all the way back to one particular bar if you want anything to drink. Before each show there is always a waitress that takes orders for drinks as well. There are also many bathrooms located throughout the mansion but they are very small inside so just be mentally prepared. As you walk through the many halls and rooms of this mysterious place you will find that there are many decorations such as posters of magicians from a bygone era, various magic props, dolls and relics. Every room has a different magician performing a very specific type of magic during the showing. Make sure to pick up a pamphlet for all the show times so you can plan out your evening. We managed to get 4 shows in before the end of the night as well as a few small table shows which mostly consisted of card tricks but still impressive nonetheless. Every single show that we caught had its own magical and unique feel to it ranging from sleight of hand, mind reading, predictions and object teleportation just to name a few. I think magicians are so talented because not only do they have to perform in front of an audience, they need to be witty and funny as well to make it interesting which is no small feat in itself. I cannot tell you how much I laughed during one performance where one of my friends kept messing up being the volunteer. I won't spoil what exactly they did at the shows because I want YOU to experience for yourself because it is worth coming here. Had I not known about this place, I would have never gone but now that I have experienced it I can easily recommended it to any of my friends. So come here and experience a wonderful night of magic and forget about your worries, just sit back and enjoy the show!",5 star rating

550,7/4/2017,"The best part of the night spent in the magic castle was the impeccable food service experience: our server was attentive and entertaining. The quality of the food is good, with just 1 vegetarian and 1 pescatarian option on the menu. As for the dress code: there was a lady in a denim jacket, here were plenty of ladies in no heels and simple sandals. So give yourself a break: your attendance (and you bringing $$) is more important. I was disappointed by Voronin's performance. It's pure Soviet clownery snd has nothing to do with magic. With his props falling apart and someone in the audience saying ""show us some real magic"", it was the weakest performance of the night. The lines are long and most of the times are already closed, the doormen are great and helpful, the AC is running too cold, so you need that jacket after all.",3 star rating

There are multiple rooms with different shows/start times - just be sure to keep an eye on the schedule. Such a swanky, classy place. Jacket and tie required for men. Great excuse to get all dolled up. You cannot take photographs inside - they are very strict. They also call for volunteers to help with the tricks. You can be a stick in the mud like me and say no.

552,7/13/2017,"This is a well deserved and coveted 5 Star review! Seeing as it's been 31 years since I was last at The Magic Castle; it's well past due!My husband and I were gifted to a guest pass for four on our recent trip to California. It was a wonderful wedding present from a fellow magician and good friend....of course we had to take my brother and his lovely wife (Best Man/Maid of Honor). Started w/ great wine selection and ordered a bottle of Spellbound Cabernet Sauvignon out of Napa; cheesy name but beautiful wine. The 4 of us shared the appetizers: seared tuna, perfection and the bruschetta, 4 different flavors that were savory or sweet but amazing in every way! Dinner was superb. The boys ordered the evening special of a Tomahawk Ribeye with sides of mashed potatoes and baby veggies; beautiful presentation and cooked perfect. My sister-in-law ordered the lamb chops, again, beautiful presentation and cooked perfectly medium rare. I chose the braised beef short ribs; melt off the bone and into your mouth! So wonderful. Our server, Norman was an absolute hoot. He was a well seasoned server and does his job effortlessly. No pictures to accompany this review as they are not permitted in the Castle but you will not be disappointed with anything you choose!",5 star rating
553,4/25/2015,"We go once a year, we have a friend/ member who performs there and we try to take friends with us who have never been for the experience. This year I took a few girlfriends from an exercise class, thought it was a good way to get to know each other better. It's pricey, no doubt. We always get comped the $30 p/p entrance to the show but we always have dinner. I am enclosing a pic of our bill so you are prepared. Re: dinner, on a scale of 1-10, we've experienced a 6 - 10, this time was an amazing 10 but it's kind of disappointing to pay these prices and get a 6. Valet was about $13 I think. I don't drink but there some pricing on wine on the bill FYI. There's a lot going on, be sure to get your money's worth, it's a fun, exciting thing to do at least once in your lifetime while you are visiting LA or even if you live here.I cant' see where I can post a pic, if I can later, I'll post the dinner receipt. The bill came to $304 without tip, there were 5 of us, we split 3 caesar salads and 2 garlic breads and we each had an entree. No dessert, 3 glasses of wine (2 glasses of Liberty Cab were a whopping $25. 68, one glass of Moscato was $9.17) Entrees start at $25 and can get pricey if you get Filet Mignon etc. (TWO-8oz Filet Mignon $94.) my Sea bass was extraordinary at $37.

There are ""tricks"" everywhere you turn -- but the shows are a real treat. Multiple rooms serve as performance stages for the best magicians you will ever see - from slight of hand experts, to close-up magicians, comedy magicians and everything in between -- you will be mystified and left wondering, how did he do that?You can dine here either in the restaurant or the bar -- of which there are many bars offering libations.

We got there around 5:15pm for our 6pm dinner reservation. We were happy to dine early because we were able to get the 8pm dinner show tickets. We watched some intimate magic shows before and after our main show. Dinner was great. Ordered the salmon and was very tasty. We had some fun interactions with other guests as well as magicians.

561,2/25/2016,"The Magic Castle, where to begin. Was invited by friends for Valentine's Day dinner and didn't really know what to expect. Apparently it's a very exclusive place and you either have to be a member or a guest of a member. It's right in the middle of Hollywood and getting there was definitely quite a journey. Dress code was strictly enforced so definitely wear a suit and tie. From the outside the location looked intriguing with the lighting and medieval like architecture. Street parking is impossible so the easiest way truly is valet. You pay for the valet and the entrance fee all together once you get inside so don't panic like I did when I realized I didn't have any cash. Heading in you speak to an owl and utter the magic words  to get in. Quite interesting. As you walk inside you can't help but appreciate the interior decoration mid 19th century. Won't delve too much into it since it'll take away from the experience of seeing it yourself. Definitely go with an open mind.Food was mediocre to be honest. Had the steak but it lacked quality and taste. Wine pairing was also mediocre.The various magic shows were awesome. I would suggest arriving at 6:30 pm so you could make the most of it. The magicians were not only quite skilled but most of them were also great comedians. The best shows in my opinion is the main show after dinner and the late show. Overall it was definitely quite an experience and would recommend this place if you haven't been.",4 star rating
562,10/13/2017,"One of the best experiences I've had in Los Angeles. If you know someone who can get you in, GO! I went on a Thursday evening with a party of 5. We had dinner reservations and decided to explore the castle with our spare time beforehand. They have a ""no pictures"" policy, and I must say, it really helps transport you back in time. Everybody is dressed to impress and it feels like you're in a bubble away from the real world. Amazing. We headed down to the bar on the bottom floor to watch Ron Bell's magic act. This guy is the real deal! Be sure to make your way over to him. We were treated to another tableside magician blowing our minds before making our way to dinner. My ONE and only issue with my experience: I ordered Beef Wellington and didn't care for it much. However, the other 4 dishes at my table were FANTASTIC (bass, salmon, filet) and the banana cream pie was absolutely superb. The main show was astounding and I even got pulled up onstage to assist with a trick (no, I still don't know how he sawed that woman in half). We ended the night watching some astounding card tricks at the 12:30 show and headed home after a late night. If I can go back, I certainly will. An amazing experience and one of the easiest 5-star ratings I've ever given.",5 star rating

564,4/16/2016,"Yay! I'm definitely a fan. Have been attempting to try this place for quite some time given it's mysterious nature and inability to just walk in. Finally an opportunity came by and I'll say it is not disappointing. I'm sure there are tons of very detailed reviews of this place so maybe mine will just be a clarification of some. I read that dinner is absolutely mandatory and that is true; however, it can be skipped if you are invited by a member. A suggestion if you are going with a big group and different cars, worth an uber ride vs the vallet (just be careful as some places are permit only).There are different acts in different rooms and sometimes they will have guests who don't usually perform there, so definitely worth going back as it changes. The acts are sometimes just magic and sometimes comedy/magic combined. The decor of the place is very Old Hollywood and people really do dress up.",4 star rating

The fact that you can only get in this place by invitation only was mysterious and exciting. You HAVE to dress up, men in suits and women in dresses. If you get caught on your phone, they will kick out your whole party supposedly. That's how serious they take their magic and don't want to be filmed. I loved every aspect of the ""dinner and multiple magic shows"" part but my only complaint was the dinner. Do not, I repeat do not go in with a party of 10 people or more. We went with 10 people and we had to pay alcohol AND food tax AND a gratuity bill of $126. Just saying, I withdrew $200 from the bank for me and my +1, ended up spending all $200 plus extra.

569,3/17/2017,"Ah, the Castle of Magic. So long I have awaited entrance through your mighty doors.Gents dressed in suits & ties and ladies in formal dresses. Magicians roaming around the public areas, mingling in with everyone else. Shows that make you question your sensory perceptions. Several bars to sit at for a drink between the shows. All in all, I am honored to have had this experience... ...buut it didn't completely blow my mind. There were 3 things that were a kind of buzz kill to all the magic. 1. Got a sort of pretentious, snobby vibe from a large number of people... some of them even being bartenders and staff.2. Not much to do between shows other than the bars. It would be nice to have performances or interactive exhibits. 3. The food :'( Disappointed me so much I even considered making giving a 3. But then I remember, people come for the experience and not so much the food. I'd still expect a lot better for such a high demand place though.Got the daily special, and I'd say it was the toughest lobster I've ever had. Gorgonzola mac n cheese was bland in flavor but also overly creamy? Boyfriend didn't seem to care for the chicken dish. I gotta say though, truffle fries at the bar are a must. Then again, when are fries ever bad?Of course I'd come back given the opportunity.

571,5/21/2018,"THE FOOD HAS MAJORLY IMPROVED!!!I've driven by this place hundreds of times over the years and never really thought much about it. From what I'd heard it was a kind of nightspot for a group of people who deemed themselves ""magicians,"" and I expected it to be a lot of nerds in capes turning flowers into wands. While that was partially the case - and there were definitely capes involved - it was so much more than I anticipated! The environment, vibe, and crowd that this place has cultivated over its 50+ years in service is pretty spectacular: think Disneyland's ""Haunted Mansion"" meets a magic shop, with patrons dressed to the 9's in quirky cocktail wear, plenty of nooks and crannies to have specialty drinks, and lots of magicians peppered about the place doing tricks and sleight-of-hand right in front of your eyes. WOULD BE A PERFECT SPOT TO BRING GUESTS FROM OUT OF TOWN, especially to showcase a bit of Hollywood history. I don't even think I explored every room because the property is so much more vast than I ever thought it was. Highlights: - IRMA, the ghostly piano player. Ask this haunted player piano to play ANY SONG... ANNNY SONG... and it will within seconds. We were surprised when she transitioned seamlessly from ""My Humps"" to Toto's ""Africa.""- THE FOOD! So many reviews on here ding this place for the food, but the experience my table of 13 had last night was out of this world. We were with a group of long-time members who noted that the menu and chefs had changed a lot over the last couple of years. The Castle's signature potato salad had been thrown out for cuts of prime beef, amazing ribs, beautiful sea bass, a to-die-for curry bisque, and a lot more. I wouldn't even say that the menu was on the pricey side for the quality and quantity of food we got. It was all DELICIOUS, and the service was fantastic. Expect to spend at least $50 per person for an entry and a drink, but you definitely get what you pay for. - THE PALACE OF MYSTERY's scheduled shows. Guests with dinner reservations get priority for tickets to this three-time-a-night show, with some pretty amazing magic acts. While the halls and close-up galleries all around the place have lots of magicians and illusionists doing some great card and rope tricks, this room seemed to have the headliners doing some real mind-blowing stuff (i.e. the Evasons and their telepathic abilities). -THE PEOPLE WATCHING. You guys... the people that frequent this place were insane to watch. Such fun outfits, personalities, and seemingly from all different backgrounds and walks of life. The age range was vast, and the stuff everyone was wearing made it feel like I was in a club from the 30s or 40s. It was great. The rules for attire and photography are strict, but definitely help to maintain the place's air of mystique and allure. To enter, you have to know someone who's a member who will extend you an invite (or email a magician who may be going on there for a pass). While an associate membership is about $750 a year, plus an initial registration fee, I think I'd rather be a member at this place than somewhere like SoHo House... definitely more my steam.",5 star rating
572,4/20/2019,The Magic Castle has recently installed blinding floodlights that broadcast ungodly and intrusive lights across buildings in the neighborhood.  Our property management company has addressed the issue and it appears that they don't care and will NOT fix the issue. How such a respected institution can be so disrespectful to our community is mind-boggling.  I am absolutely gutted having been informed of their smugness and arrogance towards people who live and (trying to) sleep nearby.  Neil Patrick Harris needs to be informed as I understand he is the chairman of that careless organization.  #notsomagiccastle,1 star rating

574,1/17/2017,"5 stars for an amazing castle! It was neat to go into. I will preface that we came for the Brunch buffet (with 3 children). I'll break it down for what parts I loved and which parts I would not go back for:Brunch buffet had great food. Desserts are not refilled at the buffet (I am guessing becasue they are gearing up for the next round of buffet patrons)The tables are crammed into the room. Unlimited Mimosa's (we don't drink) and we had to ask for drinks and were never offered just orange juice or waterKid friendly food available (fried chicken, waffles, fries and syrup and ice cream)Service was sub par with everyone seeming a bit frazzled and disconnected on the waiter and hostess end (although we did not meet any grumpy waiters)Magic Shows:The first show had all the tricks we have at home in our Melissa and Doug kit (but larger) Our son was chosen as a helper (he has some special needs and we were glad that he survived the playful but a bit overdone teasing done on stage-which was just the style of humor that artist used)The second show was longer with the first magician being great and having great stage presence. The second was not my favorite (eek dare I saw I may have seen the magic??) Content kid friendly for shows-mostly (except for the magician with the ""hand"" tickling the front of his pants while making awkward faces-c'mon) Atmosphere:The castle is amazing and I would love to go with my husband only to a dinner and show. It has a lot of alcohol available so if you are a drinker, love the idea of drinks in the afternoon while dressed up-this is a fancy place to do thatI would not recommend taking kids here (maybe age 15 plus) its not the content but the majority of people there are wandering with drinks in hand some obnoxiously (might have been the day we went on). There is a changing table in one of the larger bathrooms and high chairs are provided. We may have visited on a less than magical dayI would compare it to Medieval times you enjoy it depending on what you expect (I am one who loves Medieval times despite the overpriced food and cheesiness) I would say a special date with your child age 7+ would be enjoyable but for a family affair this would not be the place I recommend (I did call in advance to ask about if the castle was kid friendly because I could have very well found an alternative activity for us)Magic Castle Hotel is amazing and we loved our stay there though",2 star rating

I mean, I saw it when I drove by.... But I drove by lol. Unfortunately for me, it was during traffic so It cost me another 15 to go back one block :| The small street u enter is at a lil street light, right before the sign for the magic castle hotel (if ur coming west from the 101) so u missed it if u see it. Valet makes parking a breeze and all the dolled up ladies won't have to worry about a long trek in stilettos. Checkin at the front desk, ""open sesame"" and youre at ur first bar WHEEEEE!! The house wine is surprisingly delicious!We came on a tue n the castle was def crowded but not in an overwhelming way that it seems it is on weekends. We started off watching a show in each of the rooms (close up, middley sized ones n the big one) just so we could experience each but I'd have to say close up is the coolest!!! I was front row center,... As in the guy was pretty much in my lap... And I could not tell how he was doing this stuff!! How anybody could not have a great time here is beyond me cause it's so magical that it's borderline creepy!  Good stuff.  Plus, they change out shows every week so there's always something new to see. No pics inside the castle so nothing to remember the evening but ur memories..,... Too bad my memory fails me regularly. Oh well.

You enter the front lobby pay then gain admission into the front bar. It's a pretty relaxed place to drink. I would of been perfectly happy with just the bar/lounge seen. Everywhere you go is going to be cramped and have a little area. There are plenty of little intimate sitting areas. Noise is above average but we had no problems communicating between 6 people. The bathrooms are as compact and tight as you can get. Picture a standard house bathroom with 2 urnials, 2 toliets and 2 hand wash stations. Then picture 15 guys trying to use it. Seating in the main show rooms is really uncomfortable. They use cheap  fold out seats. Dinner was good.  I think $40 for  price rib dinner, $9 for crab bisque or $59 for a larger lobster tail dinner seemed fair for what we got. Magic shows were average to below average. Honestly I seen better slide of the hand and card tricks from street performers on 3rd street promenade in Santa Monica. There is a solid effort but the look the other way or let's bump music to help the illusion was a little over board. I'm not one to look for the answers but when the obvious is there. You kind of just smile and clap. All in all it ended up being $1000 night for 6 of us. Like I said  you have to experience it once, but if your not there for business dial it back. At the end of the night, it isn't worth that type of $$$.",2 star rating
578,11/10/2015,"One of my favorite places to go... Get dressed up (dress code strictly enforced), delicious food (vegan and vegetarian options available but not a big selection) and yummy drinks. There's magicians all over the castle so make sure to get there early (I think it opens at 5). Wander around all night long and you'll stumble on new acts. There's a good chance you'll be involved in some magic in some way. The theatres are intimate so make sure to be in line early or you won't get in. Also, there are TONS of artifacts everywhere so pay attention to the walls, paintings, and glass cases. It is by invitation only or stay at the Magic Castle Hotel and they will give you tickets as well (I believe you do have to make dinner reservations though and based on availability). I recommend everyone experience this gem :)No pictures inside so make sure you get your photo op in the front or just inside where you check in.",5 star rating
579,7/1/2018,"Super fun night getting fancy here with girlfriends. This is a great place to get dolled up and get your glamor on. The acts are a lot of fun. My goal pals and I indulged on the bar menu. We went with the tacos, for for $14.00. The tacos are generous and yummy. Our drink of choice was the Neil Patrick Harris, a signature Old Fashioned, strong enough to take the white off your teeth (in a good way.) We enjoyed mingling with other guest, the magic acts were great. Unfortunately no rabbit was pulled out of a hat, however the performers made up for the lack of bunny. I strongly suggest the Magic Castle for a fancy evening of being fabulous.",5 star rating
580,4/15/2019,ATTENTION!!!!! Do not waste your money...The food is terrible! The food will make you sick as it made me and my wife sick. This place needs a visit from the Health Department. I would have rather ate at Arby's than this place.,1 star rating
581,6/3/2015,How can I complain?  We got in free as guests of a performing magician (my neighbor the movie producer and long ago Junior Magician at the Castle).  So we got in for the first time with his invite and wandered about in mild amazement and good cheer.  The close up magic was delightful and all smiles.  The Houdini room was NOT experienced other then a simple walk through - and we saw 2 full acts that evening.  The next day Sunday we returned with the kids (Sunday is the only day where minors are permitted entry) and it had a different vibe.  Good fun with the kids and almost as much fun.  Parking is by valet - no getting around that.  We didn't dine there - as it was very much a mystery how to approach the Castle and experience it.  We sort of were newbies this time and we actually got away with spending ZERO $ - and now we're thinking of going back again soon now that summer is nearly upon us.I'm not sure if we'll dine there however since we have lots of strongly preferred alternatives in the area?  Time will tell -Anyways - it might be worth reminding you that entry to the Magic Castle is by invitation only through a member Magician of the Castle.  OK?,5 star rating
582,1/12/2015,"Voila! Magic, food and booze. Is there anything else you need in the world? Ok sex, but you can pull that rabbit out of your hat after you leave inebriated and mystified. Maybe I'm just super cheesy but this place rocks my world. I've been here quite a bit over the last few years and I have enjoyed every magic show. The little silly things like Irma playing whatever song I request, the old wooden bars and magician caricatures lining the walls to the old bathrooms, rock lined lower walls and the twists and turns to the close-up gallery. I feel like I'm in another world when I am here and 2a.m. creeps all too soon for me.Tips:Don't just show up, you won't get in.

584,3/25/2019,"The magic is fantastic, as expected. This review is about the restaurant. The short--absolutely horrendous experience. Last Saturday 3/23 we were seated late for dinner and the restaurant area seemed a little more bustling than normal. When we finally sat down our waiter told us that there was a party of 90 in the next room who was seated at the same time as us so he encouraged us to order quickly and make sure we left before that party of 90 so we could get good seats at our 11:30 show. That did not happen. Our table was ignored, to say the least. We were unfortunately and obviously less of a priority than the big business group. Our dinner reservation was at 9:45, and after being seated late and waiting forever, we didn't get our food until almost 11 (Party of 90 was done eating by the time we got food). We were so dazed and so hungry! Our food was great, however a quirky waiter sang Happy Birthday to s table near us and then turned around towards our table and--get this--belched. Right over our table as we were eating our long awaited meal. Gross. We had to scarf down our food to make it to our show (didn't even have time for dessert!) and sadly took our places in the back row as that was all that was available. I'm very disappointed. No one ever even apologized for the wait, because they were all busy tending to the large party. This experience did not live up to the brand this place has created.",1 star rating
585,6/8/2012,"Yelp Challenge 365 # 186/365I don't know where to begin writing this review. I guess I will start by saying it was an EXPERIENCE which will not be long forgotten.Tucked up in the Hollywood Hills, this ""Castle"" built in the 1900's sits victorian as ever. One visit is not enough to gain the full experience it has to offer. Here's what I learned:1) Its a member's club so you need to know a member to go there or, the member can give you a pass to GET IN with a fee (I don't know how much that cover is)2) Stay at the Magic Castle Hotel and you will gain entry and privilege to the Castle itself.3) Men!  COAT AND TIE A MUST.  Ladies! Dress to Impress4) If you have a pass rather than a member, be sure to have the dinner as I'm told the tickets for the shows are given to you at dinner and its value is you get seated via the express line (or VIP line) It's an evening long event starting with a very nice and tasty dinner (the menu consisted of simple: appetizers, salads and their entree) Beef Wellington, Rack of Lamb, Fresh Fish all plated with a form of starch and prepared cooked vegetables.Their wine list was above par; some vineyards seemed to be boutique vineyards as you won't find them in your local wine stop. The service for dinner is timed so you will be able to make the magic entertainment. And while you are waiting, whereever you are waiting there is a bar. I counted at least 5 bars all around the waiting areas to the show rooms and theaters. Get the schedule before you sit for dinner so you can plan accordingly to the shows you wish to see. I saw Fielding West in the Palace of Mystery and Simon Coronel in the Close Up Gallery. I need to get back there to see the many other Magicians. There were many members (Magicians mind you) sitting in the lounges quietly doing their magic.And Irma. The grand piano what will play any song if you ask her to. It took an hour (on that 101 freeway....) but hey! for the food and entertainment it was worth every second.It's a fantasic place and choice for a first date, anniversary, birthday, or NO REASON at all. I am certainly looking forward to a repeat performance!",5 star rating
586,8/22/2014,"One Word:  MAGICAL!  (Haha)I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE MAGIC CASTLE!  I fancy all things magic so when I heard that my friend had tickets to the Magic Castle, I was ecstatic!  If you ever get the opportunity to go--GO!  You won't regret it!My lovely date and I arrived around 6PM where we met up with our friends.  The castle looks as if it came out from an old fairytale or those buildings similar to the ones you see on Main Street at Disneyland.  Cheesy yet fits the theme very well!  Because of the Magic Castle's exclusivity, they enforce a dress code where men have to wear suits and women have to look classy in their evening/cocktail wear.  Some people really got fancy, fancy.  As I was reading the reviews, it seems that Valet as well as the admission rates vary depending on who is performing that day and if it's a holiday or not.  For us, valet was about $13 and admission was $30 per person and free for servicemen!  Lucky you Kevin!  Now as far as the magic tricks, I enjoyed the smaller intimate ones where you get up-close and personal with the magicians.  And if you can, try and participate in their acts!  Once we arrived at the Magic Castle, we had to find our friends.  We went downstairs to this tiny bar area.  At first I thought my friends were just getting a couple of drinks but what amazed me is that the bartender was actually a magician too! He chose me and two other individuals to be a part of his act and by the end of it, I was amazed, surprised, ecstatic, stunned at how he did his trick...literally, I was bouncing off the walls (in my head).There were other magic shows going on.  We weren't able to see all of them, but we did get a chance to check out three other acts before the end of the night.  The food at the Magic Castle wasn't as what I had expected.  First off they have a one entree minimum per person so everyone HAS to order an entree.  In addition, it's pretty pricey for dinner.  I ordered the four cheese garlic bread as an appetizer, the Beef Wellington as my entree, and two sides that I can't recall because clearly it wasn't memorable to me.  I would give the food only four stars, but since the Magic Castle is so epic--it deserves all five stars!  The one benefit of eating dinner is that you get a ticket to a final magic show at the end of the night.  If you do decide to skip out on the dinner portion of the night, you will be stuck standing around hoping you will get a seat in the theater.  One last comment I would like to make about the Magic Castle is, consider getting a silhouette of your face done by the guy with the tiny scissors.  If you go past the dining hall, you'll find a bar and next to the bar is where he will be.  He will do one head for $15, $20 for two people and $10 for a cute frame for your silhouette.  It's not everyday where you meet a guy who will cut out your face in 4 MINUTES!  (2 Minutes per person)!  He only takes cash--so don't forget to go to the bank!  It's a great souvenir to take home from the Magic Castle.  This is something one must experience once in their life!  Like I said, go if you ever get the chance, you won't regret it!:)",5 star rating
587,11/27/2017,"This is a great experience as a whole, excellent for a special occasion or just a night out with friends. First you would have to get an invitation from a member magician, then you have to call and see available dates and make a reservation. Dress up (no exceptions, no joke), show up in time and valet your car, then get ready to be mystified! The place looks like an old castle with scarce updates or remodels. The restaurant is upstairs and they have some really great food, but expensive, this is their cash cow. It's one meal per person, but you can share multiple sides or appetizers. The ""Half Chicken"" I had was really a half breast and a thigh so if it wasn't for the other stuff we shared I would have left hungry! All the food was VERY good and somewhat fancy. Pretty much everything is $40+ and add a bottle of Moet Champagne that we shared (there was a Birthday boy at our table) and you can figure out that the bill gets high. So open your wallet and eat properly before the main show, you will move from small shot to behind-the-bar magic entertainment for the rest of the evening from like 6pm to maybe 1am and you won't have much time to eat again. You can buy drinks all around the place, but staying in line for the next show will be your priority, that's how we squeezed in some 4 small shows. While in the audience chances are that you'll be part of the acts one way or another, or even be hypnotized, so be prepared to have a lot of fun! Try to engage with a magician in the audience (they wear a specific pin so they don't get picked from the audience) and earn your next invitation!",5 star rating
588,12/30/2016,"This place has the potential to be absolutely amazing. With a couple procedural changes I would give it 5 stars for sure! I work evenings and even took a day off work (which I never do) to go on a Wednesday.First the bad:-I've been wanting to go for at least 5 years, but because I didn't know a member, or even someone who knew a member I was out of luck. I get that they're trying to create a feeling of exclusivity as well as keep the numbers down, but there are better ways to do both.-The mandatory dinner requirement for non-members is ridiculous. Not only is the food horribly overpriced, but it cut into the time we needed to actually see the magicians...which is why we came!-Terrible line management options. We got there at 6:30pm and stayed until after 1am and were only able to see 3 of the 8 advertised shows. There was also an unofficial show which we were told was the best show in the house yet we also could not get in. We were also told by the staff several times to not even bother getting in line because we would not get in to that show. Multiple times we waited in line for 20-40 minutes and then had the doors closed in our face, telling us the room is full. The next shows were 45 minutes to 2 hours later, so staying in line wastes your entire night. To make things worse, we had to coordinate everything around our dinner reservation at 9:45pm, meaning 9-11pm was pretty much wasted.-The headlining shows were surprisingly not that great. I know we only saw 3, so maybe the other choices were better.-We were there on a Wednesday night. I wonder how ridiculously overcrowded this place would be on a Saturday.-The overall prices for what you got were absolutely outrageous. I went with a group of 6, but the bill for just my fiancee and I came to over $330. This included parking, door charge, mandatory dinner, and drinks. That's a lot of money to see 3 very short shows.Now the good:-By far the best part of our night were the non-headlining magicians we encountered downstairs in the dungeon and in the smaller stages and bars. Rich Freeman gave us an amazing private show in the dungeon and Pop Haydn was absolutely hilarious in the W.C. Fields Bar.-Some people might not like the dress code, but it really does make the experience much more fun. The architecture of the facility plus the inside decor really need a matching level of attire to make it feel like you truly are in another time and place.-The little pockets all around the facility where magicians can (and do) perform. These impromptu exhibitions are really fun and the closeness of these events make them much more memorable than the bigger staged events.-The magicians themselves do a great job blending in with the crowd. They've usually got a drink in their hand and then seamlessly transition to entertaining the people around them with their favorite tricks.Overall they have an amazing facility here, but 5 years of waiting to spend most of the night standing in line was disappointing. I really wish we could have just paid more up front and then not been required to have dinner. I understand that they have a huge markup on dinner and that making people eat does free up some space for the shows. I would prefer they just find the price point that works for them and further limit the number of people inside if needed...even if that means charging even more.",3 star rating
589,6/21/2018,"Was fortunate of receiving an invite from a friend that worked there, and was able to take 5 additional guests. My family is really into magic, so they were excited to go. We had the opportunity of viewing a total of 4 shows during our visit, not including this magician that was located near one of their bars towards the back end that had his individual set up doing card magic. All shows were just as equally good, but the show in the main room definitely took the cake. They had multiple magicians, and was roughly about an hour long, they also mixed in some comedy along with their show, which was a bonus. Dinner was amazing! We had the Tomahawk steak (large portion, more than enough for 2 people), the prime rib, the filet mignon, the salmon and the rack of lamb, all were really delicious, and cooked perfectly. I would definitely recommend the Tomahawk, especially if in a group that is willing to taste and try each other's dishes, and also a crowd favorite. Service was great, only wait time was when we waited about 18 minutes for our table, but that was to be expected. Will definitely love to come back, if invited again, to take our daughter once she turns 21.",5 star rating

The food was pretty good and wait staff was incredibly friendly! I do appreciate how generous they are with their mimosas, no cheaping out. The show during brunch hours is more child friendly, but entertaining nonetheless. I do appreciate the magicians we saw. They even brought out a magician from the juniors program they have and he was quite impressive. I knock off one star because I feel has though they good be more efficient. The wait outside could be managed better in the heat and the crowded dining area entrance should be organized better. I hope to return for the 21+ night time experience!",4 star rating
591,9/24/2014,"I was so ecstatic when my friend told me his friend had tickets to Magic Castle. I was even more excited when he invited me to go. Been wanting to come here for such a long time but you need to know someone to get you in, so you can it's very exclusive. I'm not sure how it works but you need to know a member or the magicians to get tickets. Dress code is pretty strict. Guys must wear a suit with jacket and tie. Girls, cocktail dress or a nice skirt and top. Parking is valet and entrance fee is $20. They charge you extra if you arrive late. Make sure to bring your id. Once you get in, it's a total different atmosphere. The decor is very old school, vintage, and you can tell it's historic. There is a bar downstairs and one upstairs. In order to view the big show you must purchase an entree. They also have small shows before and after. Our dinner was at 8 and the main show was at 10. The main show is 45 min. After the main show we saw a 20 min show at 11:15 and another 20 min show at 12:30. It was my first time so I wanted to squeeze the most experience I could. Keep in mind food is not great as I was told, you don't come here for the food but more for the magic shows and ambiance. _Truffle fries. I barely tasted any truffles. The size of the fries are big. Served warm and soft. A bit salty. Taste was good but I would not call them truffle fries. Just fries were more like it._Grilled Colorado Rack of Lamp. Marinated in garlic, rosemary & extra virgin olive oil, served with vegetables and mashed potatoes. My friend ordered it medium rare but it came out pretty rare. The lamb tasted pretty gamy compared to other lambs I've tried. Seemed a bit bland. Needed some type of sauce. _Filet of Beef. Roasted garlic whipped potatoes & pinot noir reduction served with vegetables. I asked for medium rare and this to came out really rare. The beef itself was okay. The garlic potatoes did not taste like garlic and seemed a bit cold. The best part was the pinot noir reduction. Which I wish they served more because after it was gone the steak was not as good anymore. _21 Day Dry Aged Bone in Rib Eye. 16 oz Angus, baked potato, and enoki mushroom. This was good. The baked potato was good. The mushroom was just a several pieces and had no taste at all. This was better than the other 2._Banana bread Pudding. This dessert was the best out of all 3. Pretty big portion. Good amount of fresh banana slices, the cream was good and the graham crust was great. A little dense but everything together was good._Creme Brulee. This was not that great. The custard was a bit dry and pasty. Sad to say this was one of the unpleasant creme brulee I've had. _Chocolate mousse. This was also a miss. The chocolate did not have a silky and smooth aftertaste and was way too mousse like in texture. *They also serve ice cream with each dessert. Stick with Vanilla. They came out melted and soup like. Overall food was 2 stars. But experience and everything else was 4 stars and more. A definite spot to bring a date but also great with friends. I'm so glad I finally got the chance to come here and experience the magical and historic aspect of this amazing castle. FYI you are not allowed to take pictures inside at all. But I manage to sneak a peak of the food :)",4 star rating

Irma the piano playing ghost.  I had a lot of fun with Irma.  She played my request of Besame Mucho.  Loved it.  There were some paintings with eyes that followed you.  And try the telephone.  I dare you.There are several bars throughout the castle.  There a few upstairs and one right where you enter.The food was alright. I had the chicken and my guest the short ribs.  The standout for the food was the cheesy garlic bread.  Holy crap.  Can I just eat 20 of those and call it a night?The random magic shows are awesome.  Some of the bartenders are also magicians so you can see them perform tricks before and after they serve drinks.  There's so much to explore and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.",5 star rating

594,8/30/2016,"To start: I didn't eat here. So this review is not about the food. I heard about the strict dress code but women were not dressed appropriately and no one said anything. However, my husband's tie was taken off by a magician and as soon as he handed it back to him, my husband was trying to put it back on. someone ran over and immediately told him to put it on or we would be asked to leave. They were quite rude about it but we were leaving anyway. It kind of put a damper on the whole experience. There were women who were noticeably drunk and wearing inappropriate attire but I guess that's ok? Other than that ordeal at the end, it was fun but very crowded. Since it is invite-only, I wish they had a limit on attendance. I guess that's not feasible tho. Just very crowded. Get to the shows early to get seats and be aware you will miss a lot going on outside. It would be nice if we get another chance to go back bc I think I'll just skip all the magic (not so epic) and just explore the castle. It's so vast and has so much history, but didn't have the time. Maybe next time. If not, I won't cry.",3 star rating
595,11/28/2019,"First timers. So I didn't know what to expect and didn't realize how much We would have to invest in for a night out. It was so crowded (maybe because of the holiday) we only got to see one show because all of the others were filled up so quickly. Let me begin first by saying when you get there be prepared for confusion. I gave the cashier my guest invite but didn't realize I had to pay another fee. I asked the cashier to explain the difference and she was rude and hurried through the explanation. Even if you were invited you still had to pay $25 per person and $15 for valet.Then she hurried through the list of shows and said your dinner is at 10. We weren't having dinner. She said it's mandatory.  I wasn't going to pay $15 for a cup of soup.(check menu prices online) We took our one nice picture( that's all you get) and walked in. The scene is cool. Very very elegant. Like tuxedo elegant. My husband thought I was joking about the strict dress code. So first I went into the bathroom, pulled out my phone and my phone was still open up on camera. An employee walked in and looked at me and my phone and snapped at me saying there are absolutely no phones and pictures allowed. I told her I wasn't taking a picture but my phone froze on the camera. So we went to the bar. The nice bartender slowly explained how everything worked because you have to get in line an hour before for everything. We were able to ditch the mandatory dinner and watch the main show at 10pm instead of our original reservation of 11:30pm. The magic show was awesome. The magicians from Spain brought magic, wonder,and comedy. After the 45 minute show we tried to watch another magic show but all rooms were full. We ended watching the piano Irma. Which was cool but you had to donate a big bill for her ""spirit"" to awaken and play a song. I made a joke and said ""Irma don't be greedy"" and she started to play. Lol. Lastly we went to the cellar and watched one last 10 minute show. We left rushed by valet and left. Overall I mean the only fun I had was watching the magic show. The castle itself is run under real ridiculous rules and overpriced. I wouldn't come again because I was so overwhelmed and rushed that I couldn't enjoy the whole experience.",2 star rating
596,3/1/2015,"Overall, a fun experience! However, I don't think I'll be back. I went in expecting to be nickeled and dimed for everything, but I was pleasantly surprised! Yes, it is definitely an expensive trip (parking is $13, dinner will be at least 35 but probably more, and drinks will cost you a good 40 bucks) but our waiter at dinner actually gave us two free glasses of champagne! His name was Norman and while I did think he was a little too sassy, it turned out okay. The food was definitely mediocre and overpriced but you can't really get around it since its mandatory. We only went to the main ticked magic show which was a magician with the last name mcbride (can't remember his first name) and it was good but the 40 minute show felt very short and I wasn't super impressed.The staff is soooo uptight and snooty. I could care less for that part but you kind of have to know that going in. I was wearing a leather jacket and I had to coat check it because the zipper was too casual for the dress code. Not a big deal thought. Anyway, the upstairs bar by the main show has a wonderful bartender but he only works on the weekdays. If you have the chance, check it out but be prepared to spend a pretty penny on mediocre food and a show. It's all about the experience.",3 star rating

598,12/18/2016,So we got charged sales tax on 18% gratuity...uh....is that even legal?? And the prime rib...came out cold. We asked to change it for meat that hasn't been sitting out to cool and got the same meat back...but grayer. Thanks for microwaving it! Wtf??Edit*Lol some yelpers are so dumb. Someone sent me a msg shaking her head because i was upset they charged us tax on gratuity. So that $40 discount was because we didnt eat any of the cold prime rib...after we made sure to confirm it wouldn't come out cold. I think im right to be upset when one person has to wait to eat their food while everyone else has their order. And if they deduct the cost of the meal because we couldn't eat it...i think that's a given. So after that deduction...that means we are being billed on gratuity too. Subtotal of food minus cost of uneaten cold food...plus tax was equal to what we were charged. Which means yeh...we were charged for gratuity. Ridiculous.,1 star rating
599,11/20/2016,"Have to do a small update and I wish I had pictures to go with my dinner. Dinner at the Magic Castle is always something of a special occasion, and this visit was no exception. I had in mind a nice seafood Louie salad that my wife got back in June, but to my dismay the menu is constantly changing and my salad was gone. Instead I decided to jump at the Tomahawk rib-eye, medium rare, and my buddy who was dining with us also went with the Tomahawk. Our wives went with the beef wellington and petite filet Mignon. Before I ordered I asked how large it was, I was told 14oz. so I figured it was not the 2 person Rib eye that some friends had ordered on another visit last Christmas, but rater a smaller singular steak. When the waiter put it down in front of me my eyes welled up, a nice large bone in rib eye cooked to perfection. I barely touched my baked potato and polished off every last morsel of meat clean off the bone. The reason I want to mention this steak is because this was the second best steak I have ever had, Larsen's in Encino still holds the title in my books. If you decide to partake in this glorious act of mastication be prepared to shell out $75 for this lovely bovine masterpiece. I wish I could have taken a picture (pictures not allowed anywhere inside the Magic Castle) because though the price was steep, the meat was neat, next time I will just order the prime rib so I can save mortgaging the house for dinner, Aloha",5 star rating
600,4/3/2017,"Wow. This was a blast. I have always loved magic, seen Cooperfield, Blaine on stage, on a TV screen. But to be in this haunted mansion/castle with a labyrinth of corridors, floors, rooms AND in such close proximity of the magicians was the BOMB! How do he do that, where did he hide the ball, the card, the rabbit??  Pull my friend's watch out of my ear??!We all liked being in a throwback to an earlier day of manners, dress, swank, style and great food. The restaurant was lovely, 1890's, plush, a great vibe, nearly a gaslight Victorian feel. The  service refined, just the right temp and complemented by a wonderful menu. The Colorado rack of lamb pink on the inside was scrumptious. My family group loves to share and we did my lamb, the prime rib, sea bass and salmon. All came out great. (Secret: don't miss the Magic Castle Chile... it is truly inspired!)We got there around 7ish, valet parking was fast, despite being a Sat. night. Entry was a breeze. Then, before dinner, a few acts. After dinner several  more. We were there to closing. All the magicians were standouts. Blew our minds and all have wit, humor and a tribal in their eyes. Bill Joslin and Chef Anton were memorableThe Magic Castle is unique! Find a friendly magician to get you an invitation, it will be a once and a life experience.",5 star rating
601,8/25/2014,"The Magic Castle maintains a regal hiding spot perched atop a hill overlooking Hollywood. And rightfully so.  This establishment is an exclusive members only experience.  It has been for decades.  And will be for decades to come. Unfazed by social media and the quickly evolving world outside the castle walls, the magicians who grace the dark and hazy halls are a special breed.  All with their vastly unique specialties, the members have this old world stoic respect for the art of magic and illusion.There are artifacts around every corner, mysterious bars in each den.  You can have a full sit down dinner on the main floor, or cozy into an old mahogany bar stool for a whiskey and lighter fare on the upper level.   There are a handful of different stages - some as intimate to only hold a dozen guests, others with a stage and elevated seating for 200. The magicians only perform one or two weeks a year, to always keep the material fresh and jaw dropping. I could spend hours trying to find the right descriptive words to describe a visit, but I think I'll just briefly recount my new favorite place in Los Angeles, through my eyes.Dress coats & ties are a must.  When you pay for valet you are given a secret code to say aloud at a bookcase, which opens you into the castle.  I could have left after this and felt satisfied with the experience. The halls are draped with dark red curtains, the owner (who is in his 90s) will always be sipping down a drink and engaging a patron somewhere amongst the bars scattered on the two floors.  The first bar is for beginners.  The amateurs who are practicing their first sleight of hand.  These hopefuls are sporadically visited by one of the great veteran magicians to bestow a piece of invaluable knowledge.  We cozied up to the bar for a glass of wine before dropping in to see a dear friend Adam Trent's magic show.  The room held no more than 30 people, his act was was sidesplitting funny, and the magic awe-worthy. After the half hour show we were back out to enjoy some quick tricks by passerbys at the bar before catching the final 11:30 show at the biggest stage.  The first act was the magician that played the hand on the Adams Family.  He was eerily quiet and utterly mesmerizing to watch, his tricks classic sleight of hand with a level of superior sophistication.  The second act was akin to a comedy central standup where the comedian takes props from a giant chest. He was hilarious, pulling material from the audience.The Magic Castle is just that.  Magic.  A hidden gem that takes you back a half a century to a time where we would appreciate a trick or illusion without googling how it was done.  A time where we respected a stage with a single performer and a castle with a password.",5 star rating
602,9/2/2014,"We went on a super busy holiday weekend so didn't get to see as many shows as we might have liked, but this is still a wonderful, unique experience.  Food was just ""OK"" - nothing special and very over-priced.  But hey, this isn't going to be a cheap evening - there's valet parking ($13 plus tip), entry fee ($30 for non-members), mandatory dinner (at least $30 ++ per person) - and that's before any cocktails!  But you knew that going in, right?  And it's not something you do often, or it isn't something I'd like to do more than maybe once a year or less.  But it is a ""MUST DO"" if you live in LA or are just a very connected visitor to La La Land.",5 star rating

604,12/3/2014,I was lucky enough to get a chance to go to The Magic Castle while I was visiting LA recently. I did a little research on the place and found the concept intriguing. The dress code is black tie and they take this very seriously. No pictures can be taken once pass the lobby. The location is an old mansion that has been renovated into dozens of small rooms and bars along with a restaurant. Magicians perform in various locations throughout the castle. A schedule lets you know who is performing in which room. You'll need to line up early because seats fill up fast. The shows I saw were very entertaining and tricks ranged from card to cutting a woman in half. The magicians are typically there for only one week which means you'll want to go back to see different performances . I had dinner and a number of cocktails. The service was excellent. I started dinner with a crab bisque. This spicy soup was perfect and I cleaned the bowl. For my entrée I had salmon with asparagus and risotto. It was cooked to perfection. I added a rock lobster tail which took my meal to new heights. The lobster melted in my mouth. The entrees are priced $30 or more. If you are having dinner each guest must order an entree. I tried two craft cocktails that were delicious and unique. My favorite was the red mule. The pear martini was a bit too sweet. The craft cocktail prices seem reasonable at between $10-$13 a drink. Overall it was a fantastic experience.,4 star rating
605,6/23/2017,Such a fun and entertaining place! The magic shows were the best I've ever seen. The dinner was excellent (I had the seabass) and so was the reisling. The service was great too. Highly recommend this place for a fun night in LA,5 star rating
606,9/22/2018,Great place to go. For two itll still cost you a pretty penny.  Best advice is to get there at 5pm. See the two early shows then go eat dinner.  So get reservations at 6pm for dinner.  Afterwards you can see one more show before one the main shows.  Around that time itll start to get busy.  I went on a friday fyi. I was fortunate to go and it was funny hearing drunk dudes brag about money trying to get into womens pants. Had a blast though. Go once in your life at least.,5 star rating
607,7/15/2019,"The Magic Castle is one of my favorite places! I've been coming here for as long as I can remember (my parents were members). From my fantastic childhood birthday parties during Sunday brunch, to dining in the Seance Room, the dining is always a fun experience.  The magicians are superb, as only the best perform here. There's always something fun hiding around the corner. Be sure to ask the staff about the history, too!  They always have such fun facts! Don't show up in jeans or tennis shoes- this is a social club, after all!  The adjacent hotel has always creeped me out, though!",5 star rating
608,1/20/2015,"Such a great place!!!This members only club is one of a kind. You must have an invitation to attend. Dressy attire is required and get ready for a night of great entertainment.I have been a few times and leave stunned every time...I have seen coins disappear into thin air, birds appear out of fire balls andcard tricks up close and personal like you won't believe.The castle is an old mansion that hosts magicians from all over the world. Each experience at the castle is unique, because depending on the magician that night, you will have a different night of magic / entertainment. I recommend getting there at 5. Grab a drink, have dinner at 6 and enjoy the different unique rooms from 7:30 to 12. Entrance fee is usually 25 dollars, dinner ranges from 30 -50 and all the magic is priceless!!!!",5 star rating

611,11/2/2014,"Rob Zabrecky is a must-see. He is an artist who performs magic. Seeing him made me want to see more magic shows at the Castle.Also, the magic classes are really fun if you are genuinely interested in magic. There are 4 classes in the series. The classes are taken by all types of people but skews to the older crowd. It's good for some people and perhaps not for others. If you're a curious person who absolutely must know everything about how something works this may be for you; you'll finish the class wanting to know more and develop a deeper interest in magic.BUT, if you're the type where once you know how something works, the mystery is gone for you and you'd rather share secrets with your friends -  please do not sign up for the class. And if you end up taking the class, plz do not heckle the magicians because you think you know better (like I saw one student who got called out by the magician). Just because you know how something works and can brag to your friends about it, does not mean you are skilled enough to perform. There's a reason why the magician is up on stage and you are not. It takes years to perfect the art that blends performance, acting/improv, stage presence, psychology, etc. These magicians can make magic looks so easy and effortless but they have been practicing and performing magic for years.",5 star rating
612,7/28/2014,"Okay, given that the Magic Castle has thousands of reviews, I'll try to keep my review short and sweet. If you are able to score an invite here, you already know how exciting it is to get to visit. Some tips: come early if you want to make the most of the shows. Some of them you have to start waiting in line an hour before. The rooms are small so they fill up fast, especially since a lot of people have pretty big parties. If you can't get into a show, head down to the basement. The bartenders there know some really good tricks, and also there are some impromptu shows as well from some guest magicians, so you may be able to catch something that isn't on the program. Irma the ghost pianist is delight. Make sure you have some cash on you so you can request a song: you'd be surprised as to what she knows (Coldplay? Yes. Lady Gaga? BOOM, she knows that too)The food is pretty good, you obviously don't go to the Magic Castle for the dinner, but it is pretty decent for being a ""forced meal"" that you have to get. I don' t think they will split the tab, so just make sure you bring cash if you are with a large group of friends and want to make settling the bill easier.",5 star rating
613,5/21/2016,"The seance was not magical or spiritual in any way! I felt Disneyland could have created a more magical and realistic experience. It was easy to figure out how the tricks were being performed. (Look for the string as the the magician is holding when the doll ""moves"" her pencil.) The food and waiter was mediocre. For $1200, I'd expect much more attentiveness. The seance is NOT WORTH IT, NOT EVEN A LITTLE. I brought this up to the General Manager and he said it was a private club and any issues with the evening should have been brought up that night. I felt ripped off by the experience.",1 star rating
614,12/18/2016,"Have u ever spent $22 on bread before? We have lol our waitress asked ""would you like some bread?"" Thinking it was free like everywhere else, we said yes please. We were a party of 6. They brought out a basket of 6 tiny squares of cheese bread. We gobbled them up and I asked for more bread. They brought out another basket, same size. We were still waiting for our food so the hubs asked for another order Cus we were starving. The waitress then said ""oh you want to order more bread?""  That's when we learned they weren't complimentary. Those 6 squares cost us 11$. So in total we spent 22$ on bread on top of our over priced meals. The shows were okay. I was pretty excited to go when a friend invited us but I feel like it was over hyped.

617,3/23/2016,"Hmmm, magic castle and I have a long history. I first toured it with a magician who had trained there and it was strange to see stacks of magic books, trick paintings and string tricks. Seriously geeky. I was hooked. I've gone once or twice a year for the past decade and have never seen the same show twice. I have to say, the magicians are always good, whether they are the main show or just a corner parlor act. The food is surprisingly good as well. Especially the garlic cheese bread. I just went tonight and took off one star because I feel like they changed administration. People were reading from index cards to introduce acts or explain history and one server forgot my Coke and my change. Hopefully tonight was a fluke because most nights are pretty magical.Finally, there is a HUGE difference between going with a member (cheap valet, discount on dinner, no door fee) and going with a guest pass...double valet, 20 per person door fee and mandatory dinner at standard fare. Bottom line: find a member and go! But take them to dinner there because those memberships aren't peanuts either. :)",4 star rating
618,4/25/2017,"Simply amazing! This has been a bucket list experience for me ever since my mom told me about her experience at the Magic Castle over 30 years ago! My friend was able to get tickets through another friend for my Christmas present. I really had no idea what to expect going to the castle. I've seen plenty of magic shows in Vegas, but nothing really compares to this! I loved how all the viewing rooms are super small. There really are no bad seats! As a plus, my best friend and I got to participate in several different magic shows!!! The dinner was also great. Pricing wise, it's a little more than I would normally spend on a ""fancy"" dinner, but you are also paying for the atmosphere, so I didn't feel too bad. 3 out of 4 of us in our party ordered the cajun prime rib at the recommendation of our server. It was awesome! My friend ordered the filet mignon, and she said it was really good too.Everyone throughout the castle was super friendly. It was also a lot of fun to be able to dress up super fancy for a change. They have a very strict dress code, but it just adds to the special feel of the place. One of the highlights of the night (aside from getting to go up on the main stage), was that we discovered this cool Haunted Mansion hallway in the basement area. We stumbled upon this little show going on down there, and when we went to the ""exit"" we discovered it was a hidden hallway! They even had a prop from the Haunted Mansion in there.I was told by others who have gone to the magic castle that this is an experience you will probably only want to do once...they are crazy! I would go back again and again if I could get more passes!",5 star rating

620,12/1/2014,"In order to get in here, you need to know someone who is a member or become a member.  They offer valet parking for a small fee (I think around $13).  They only have valet, no self parking.  You won't be able to take pictures once you are inside of the venue.  They are pretty strict with the dress code, so dress appropriately, or you will have to borrow clothes that probably won't fit you.  When we went, there was a $30 drink minimum.  We ate dinner there - pretty pricey, but a decent meal.  I tried the prime rib, which was juicy and flavorful.  Expect to spend at least $50 per person on dinner with one drink.  After that, we headed out to the main show.  It was entertaining and fun!  There was a little audience interaction, which kept it lively.  There are other shows that you can watch all around the castle as well.  It does get a bit crowded, especially in the stairways.  But overall, it's a fun, and expensive night (if you plan to eat).",4 star rating

The magic shows are all amazing and fully entertaining being interactive and mystifying! The atmosphere is classy and loose.

624,11/16/2016,"Yo, this place is legit. I wish I was a magician so I wouldn't have to bother my friend for an invitation all the time. I've gone maybe 3 or 4 times this year and every time it's been great. I won't go into too much detail because I'll ruin the magic. But I will say this, be sure to show up way before your actual 'reservation' dinner time. There's a lot to do, such as play hide and seek. Jk. More like, magicians doing card tricks at different rooms, and mini shows as well. I'll admit, there are magicians that didn't give me that Wow factor, and then there are some who gave me that ""HOLY S*(@% What the @#% was that?!"" factor. Be sure to ask the bartenders, managers, or people that go there all the time, about which magician you should see (asides from the main one. You get a main event if you get a reservation). It's a bit pricey, but you're in HOLLYWOOD. What do you expect? In my opinion, dressing up like as if it were the great gatsby, with a ton of other people is an awesome experience. And of course, seeing a ton of magic. The food is good, make sure you get them garlic fries. Those fries alone, are magical!",5 star rating

I probably said ""How did they do that?!"" more times than I care to admit, but I was seriously impressed.

626,5/5/2014,"I've had a the pleasure of visiting the Castle twice and both times it has been a wonderful experience. The place can get cramped a bit on weekends, but if you get their early you can still have a great time before the huge rush arrives. The shows in the various theatres are a lot of fun, but not as fun as just roaming around and stumbling upon a magic show at one of the many tables around the castle. That's where the true wonderment occurs in my opinion. I've had dinner here the second time I visited and while it was tasty, it wasn't really anything that stood out. It's more about the 'hey, I'm having a classy expensive meal in the Magic Castle!' than 'I'm having this great meal AND I'm at the Magic Castle! I can't wait to have this again!' But I kinda expected that. My only complaint is that sometimes you have to sit down next to some guests who might have had one too many drinks. I've never been around someone who's been belligerent or anything, but definitely around people who were being very inconsiderate of those also trying to have a good time. But I guess that'll happen when you're in an area with as many bars as this place. I've also seen employees come up and say 'if you don't stop, we will have security throw you out.' It's good to know at least they're watching.If you ever have the opportunity to visit the Castle, you have to take it. It's really an experience unlike anything else.",5 star rating

Magic is everywhere, and at every corner, someone is performing so you are never bored ""looking for something to do.""

All the staff are friendly and very helpful.  What I love is everyone's genuine appreciation and respect for the castle and just like the crowd, the magicians range from all ages. Plenty of bars to quench your thirst and the food is absolutely on point and the best part is that it does not take long for your food to be served. For dinner I ordered the chicken and for dessert I had the poached pear a la mode. Everything was perfectly made! My friends and I watched 3 shows and 2 up close table card tricks. So don't be afraid to show up at 7p with a dinner reservation at 9:45. You may see some celebrities too (hi Jason Sudeikis!) On to the main show, we watched the The Charlatans in the Peller theatre. It's the smallest theatre but the most intimate. They combined some audience participation with improvisation in a theatrical comedy style. La-la-loved it! Once the show was complete we headed up stairs and was able to catch one last show at 12:30 am... yes you read that correctly...a.m. Performed by Nathan Kranzo and another show filled with laughter.This magical place is access through membership and invitation only.

If you can score an invite or know someone, making this one of the most exclusive nightclubs ever. Despite the exclusivity of this place, the Castle was packed when my friends and I went on a Saturday night. I can't speak to weekday evenings.Be sure to sit at the front for a more interactive experience since the magicians will involve you! Laughs were had all night. Magic is everywhere! There are magic shows going on all the time, some of which you can pop in and watch, some of which you need to wait for since they're in small theaters. My friend had reserved for dinner 2 months in advance and still got 9:40pm seating for dinner. We were so hungry! But the food was pretty good and the service was not bad. It is pretty pricey so beware. It's ~$40 an entree and includes things like scallops, sea bass, beef wellington, filet mignon, etc.The one thing I was a little disappointed with was not being able to take pictures.

They have roughly 3-4 bars in the castle (didn't venture all the way through so it could be more) and they have a restaurant as well. We ordered the Pub burger with truffle fries and I'll say the fries were amazing! The burger was decent and perfect for putting food in your stomach while drinking all night.As for the magicians, they had some great ones that night, Suzanne being my favorite. They were all really friendly and the magic was jaw dropping. I'm still trying to figure out how they did a few tricks in my head. Our guide, Adrian, was awesome and handle the night very well!

We were sitting there for about 2 hours. To be honest, I did not come to eat I came for magic. I was hoping there would be something fun while were sitting around the table twiddling our thumbs, but nothing. The food was okay for me, I mean I did really love the garlic/ cheese bread and soup of the day (potato soup). The chicken entree was okay. The worst part was my friend who ordered the Chicken Cobb salad got very ill from it. She was in and out of the bathroom the entire rest of the night at the castle and the next day at her home.After dinner we were excited to start seeing magic. The main show was good, but more of a comedy show then magic. I was very confused. It was like an hour or something. There was 1 guy who spent 15 minutes or so doing really cool things with birds. I did really love him! Then a sword swallower. He was pretty damn cool too. But.... that was it? The host of the show was more of a comedian. I thought it was a good/cute show, but nothing special. I was hoping this was just the intro to the rest of the night. At 11:00pm or so we are ready for a couple more hours of magic. I moved my meetings later Tuesday so I could enjoy the Monday night at the castle. After we got out we walked around and once again were very confused as to why nothing was taking place. It looked like there were 2 other rooms scheduled to see magic but the lines were full so we just stood around. I noticed one of the girls was working outside the close up magic room and begged her to let us in that room for the 11:15pm. The next show wasn't until 12:30. She did! Thank god! There were no seats so we stood the entire time in our dresses in heels. My feet hurt! Not ideal but we got in. The close up show was okay. It was fun, but not nearly the best magic I have seen. I mean I have seen this kind of stuff on the Venice boardwalk a couple years ago. After this show we walked around more, went downstairs, upstairs and there was 0 magic. The last show in the upstairs room was also at 12:30 or so but he said if there wasn't 20 people it would not take place. We didn't want to wait around for another hour with 0 to do except hope they have a show.We left! I know it was a Monday night and I feel lucky I was able to check out the castle, but I could not have been more disappointed. I would try it again but def NOTTTT during the week. Maybe there isn't as much magic....idk? Either way that is completely unfair as we paid the same amount as any other normal night. Every night should be the same for the price we paid! It doesn't close until 2am and therefore some magicians should be there too.My friend will probably never go back as she was very ill from the food. Maybe bad eggs in the salad or bad chicken, not sure? I know everyone wants to try the castle but is it really worth it? To me on this night, it 100% was NOT. Maybe some day I will try again, but I have never been so disappointed in LA as I am pretty easy to please. I have never even written a bad yelp review. Very upsetting! =(",2 star rating
638,1/21/2016,"Ambiance: Rating 5 - Without a doubt, the best part of the Magic Castle is the ambience. It has an authentic 1960's feel with velvet walls/curtains, images from the past, celebrity photos, outdated illusion gimmicks, wood furniture/decoration, and soft lighting. Food: Rating 3 - If you're not a member of the Magic Castle, you will be required to make a dinner reservation with your attendance. Each guest must order an entree, and the cheapest one is $31 (Vegetarian Risotto). You will see a full menu list in other reviews, so I don't feel the need to expound, but just know that it is NOT cheap. The food is good enough to not send back or complain, but a table of 4 was $200 (including tip and the chocolate cake we ordered).Dress code: Rating 3 - It's half-nuisance, half-fun to be forced into a strict dress code where everyone must wear a jacket. It definitely muffles the reality that most people there never dress nicely or have owned a jacket before their first visit. As you walk around and people-watch, it adds a level of ""high-class"" to see everyone looking attractive and clean.Parking: Rating 2 - $13 if you're a non-member to have valet park your car. There is no self-park and there is no alternative other than walking or getting dropped off from somewhere else. Service: Rating 0 - The girls at the front desk who check your reservation and charge you for parking never smile. They have no energy and seem either really arrogant or ""over it"" or both. They don't have any customer service skills, and they seem to really enjoy the moment when the customer leaves their presence. The busboy/bathroom cleaner must really hate life and was a very poor choice in hire. While he was cleaning the bathroom, he yelled something to line of women outside (which none of us could hear). We waited for him to restock the toilet paper, and after a couple minutes, he stormed out and said to us, ""Fine! Since you don't want to listen."" None of us had any idea what he was talking about, and it left a very sour taste in our mouths... literally. He didn't restock any toilet paper or empty any trash cans.NOTE TO THE MANAGER: While I did not get his name, I will leave a description here of what this young man looked like so you can make the decision whether to correct this outrageous behavior. You have laid strict expectations on your guests to dress and behave a certain way, so your employees should be held to the EXACT SAME STANDARD. He was Latino with glasses. :)Back to my review... There was only one bartender, and he only listened to the waitresses who brought orders from the pre-performance attendees. Magic: Rating 3 - This place is very hit-or-miss with the magic. Primarily, I believe this is because they have to fill up a full schedule of magicians every day of the week year round. I've been there about a dozen times now, and the best magician I ever saw there was from South America. He was so gifted and graceful... And he didn't make cheesy jokes or use cheesy music. The ""big show"", which you get VIP seating for via your dinner reservation, usually showcases a group or solo act that has done at least small casinos in Vegas. The material is fairly polished and the jokes induce a few chuckles. The smaller stages have smaller acts with smaller laughs and impressive tricks.Overall: Rating 2 - My first visit to the Magic Castle was in 1998, and I was in complete awe of how new and unique everything about it was. Seventeen years later, like everything else in life, it's gotten a little stale. My advice to the manager(s) is to fire the lazy workers, re-train the hard workers and force them to treat new visitors BETTER than your members, otherwise we have no reason to go back and spend your much-needed income on overpriced food and drinks. Members are lucky enough to be exempt from those experiences.",2 star rating
639,8/14/2017,"Was our first time there. Place is amazing and different from everything omg else I've seen before. Mansion itself is very cool, 1920s looking, filled with surprising and fun paintings / pictures. We went Sunday for birthday dinner. Dress code makes atmosphere sophisticated and exciting. Champagne cocktail ""magic moment"" is very good if you like raspberries and bubbles. Miso sea add was spectacular! Must try. Portions are big and I think worth the price. Shows were really cool, loved Nathan Fan and Sousa performances. They give you free cake and drink if you celebrating a birthday. I think this place is perfect for someone who is looking for different interactive dress up experience. Would love to come back again!",5 star rating
640,3/27/2016,"First of all this was the most amazing crew of people I've ever seen working under one roof. They were organized, polite, and efficient. Prepare to drop $100 EASY but the food is great and the performers are AMAZING.Unfortunately, you should also prepare to deal with drunk idiots all night. The place is crowded and there were a lot of overserved people walking around at the end of the night. During the final show (the big show that we planned the whole night around) the entire row behind us were loud and extremely drunk. They heckled the performers and ruined the experience for my group. At one point a woman was so drunk that she fell down (ok that part was pretty entertaining) but no one came and told them to shut up or asked them to leave. I'm perfectly fine with dropping a lot of cash on a nice night at a place I came to believe was iconic and special. I'm totally cool with the fact that there are a million rules you have to follow. I am NOT okay with following through with the above just to have to put up with a lot of spring breakers ruining our night. Seriously disappointed. The performers and wait staff shouldn't have to put up with this and the audience didn't pay to deal with it. I came out of the night believing the magic castle is fairly overrated. They should really make announcements before the shows that if you disrupt that you will be removed from the castle. I mean don't take off your suit jacket but go ahead and get fall down drunk.",3 star rating
641,12/15/2013,"Oh yah baby! I've finally reached my 100th review. I want to make it memorable and what's more fitting than to pick The Magic Castle? I first discovered this place by driving by after my hike at Runyon Canyon. I was thinking to myself, wow what a neat place! Next to the Castle, they also have the Magic Castle Hotel. Never thought I would come back to check it out but little did I know, my bf surprised me.  ^__^~THINGS TO KNOW BEFOREHAND: The Magic Castle is pretty exclusive, you have to be a member or to be invited. Needless to say, I was honored to be invited! Formal attire is strictly required. Men should be suited at all time. The only time for a guy to take his jacket off is at dinner or if he lends his jacket to a lady. Try to arrive at the castle by 5 pm and you will have plenty of time to watch all the shows, grab some drinks, relax and possibly get a grand tour of the castle. No photography or filming allowed inside the castle, especially when magicians are performing. I took pictures at dinner. Drive up towards the castle, valet park for $10.00. ~AMBIANCEDark, romantic and antique ish. ~HISTORYSince we arrived fairly early and looked lost, Wendy who works there were nice enough to offer us a grand tour and was extremely helpful explaining everything. She informed us that the castle is 2200 sq ft, consists of 5 bars and 3 sets of bathroom all throughout. There are 3 floors. The basement is called the Inner Circle where they host magic shows and teach magic lessons. Call 323-851-3313 if interested but must be 21 years or older. ~SHOWSBe sure to grab a pamphlet at the reception desk. It will have the time of all shows and the performers. We made it to almost all of the shows with good timing. Manage your time well, you are on your own if you want to catch certain shows, if you are lost, ask any of the host and they will be more than happy to assist. The magicians here are awesome. Majority of them are up close. You literally sit on the same table with them as if you're playing poker. Yes, that close and they do their magic....and you sit there in awe & admiration. The magicians also like the audience to participate, which it was very fun! I heard every week is different performers. If you have a dinner reservation, you'll have guaranteed seats with the grand finale show which in our case was the ""Palace of Mystery"". Or else it's first come first serve. Your server will give you your tickets when they bring the bill. Let me just say that the Palace of Mystery with Chris Mitchell, Tina Lenert and Les Arnold & Dazzle were great! Not only they were good, but extremely entertaining and funny! Chris Mitchell will have you laughing in tears! Overall, my bf and I had a great time! ~FOOD & DRINKSYou can order drinks & snacks at any of the 5 open bars. You may take the drinks inside the show but not the food. I had their Long Island which was decent. Also tried their Ginger Pineapple Cocktail and that was not good. It was too gingery and it made me kinda sick. At dinner, we had the:-Magic Castle chili: Not impressive. Comparable to Wendy's -Beef Wellington: Beef was very tender and the mashed potato that came with it was very buttery. The breading wrapped in beef was just ok. (4 stars) -Grilled salmon: Salmon was sweet and fresh, rice that came with it had a hint of salt and the veggies were delightful with bits of kiwi (4.5 stars) -Creme Burlee: Came with a scoop of ice cream, which we decided to have it with coffee. It was all good (4 stars) *They have a very tiny gift shop.",5 star rating
642,12/27/2016,"In one year, I went from going to The Magic Castle zero times to three times. So 2016 wasn't all bad. I first heard about Magic Castle not long after I arrived in LA and I've been chasing a entry pass in there the whole time. A membership is now officially on my bucket list.This old house perched on top of a hill holds as many mysteries as magicians themselves. Barely visible doorways lead you through an old maze full of surprises, bars, and roving magicians ready to show you a card trick or make a valuable disappear (and reappear if you're lucky).If you're a magic fan or are looking for a memorable night out, then this is definitely a place to find your way into. But as the Castle is invite only, good luck in your entry quest. And it's also can be a pricey evening, but it's all worth it to mingle and watch some of the best magic that Los Angeles and the world has to offer.",5 star rating
643,9/29/2014,"This experience is the epitome of classiness: fancy clothes, fine dining, and magic shows in a very exclusive Los Angeles landmark. I've managed to frequent the Magic Castle three times thanks to the incredible generosity of some close friends. Each time has been a complete and utter blast.Firstly, I'm reviewing this from the perspective of a guest, as I currently don't make enough Benjamins to afford an annual membership. Be ready to fork over around $50-$60 alone for entry/ mandatory valet fees. Once you're inside, you can chill at the stocked bar, mingle with other guests, or listen to Irma play the piano (she'll take requests if you tip her a buck or two).The dinner itself is very high-end, with the cheapest entree being $30, and that's the basic vegetarian dish. They of course require guests to purchase an entree, so that's another way they get you. With that said, the food is delicious and the service top-notch.The magic shows themselves occur in three distinct stages listed here from highest to lowest audience capacity: The Palace of Mystery, Parlor of Prestidigitation, and the Close-Up Gallery. While you're basically guaranteed seating for the Palace of Mystery, prepare to line-up if you want to view the magic acts in the other two stages. All the magic performers I've witnessed have been stellar, regardless of their specific area of specialization. The evening does become a bit blurry late one as one consumes more drinks and the audiences become more rowdy, but that's to be expected in such an environment, especially when there's a bar seemingly every 10 feet.Overall, the Magic Castle is an experience of exclusivity, class, and of course, awe-inspiring magical acts. I love it, and look forward to continuing to enjoy it for the rest of my life. Plus, if you want to entertain company from out of town, this is the best way to do it.",5 star rating
644,1/23/2018,"So I spoke with the general manager.  He continued to yell at and insult me.  Stated that he watched videos in which I could barely stand.  I couldn't stand because my shoes were killing, which I had explained to security and why I was sitting.  He then stated that the additional charges were placed by my boyfriend on my card, which is somehow ok.  No one has permission to use my card, so stating that he could see my name on the card used (after I was escorted out) somehow makes the charges ok.  Nope.  It does not.  He concluded his rant by telling me that I'm never allowed back.  Pretty sure I'll get over that one.  I also violated ethics.  Lol.  I guess it's an ethical violation to drink at a bar on a pretentious club.  If you don't want drinking, don't have a bar in every room!  Total creep.  Bottom line is, if you kick someone out of your ""club,"" make sure their date knows, especially since there is no other way to contact him/her.  Ps.  Glad that you let you're bf use your card.  That doesn't make it the law.",1 star rating

646,8/7/2017,"I had to create a Yelp account so I could write this review.I cannot recommend the Magic Castle enough. I recently went for my 23rd birthday with 8 family members, and we had the best time of our lives. First off, the dinner was phenomenal. We were sat right at our reservation time of 6:00 pm, and service was quick, but not rushed. We all ordered drinks at the bar and brought them up with us to dinner, but our server provided us with two bottles of Champagne and made sure our drinks were always full. I ordered the short ribs, which were amazing. They were sweet, but not too sweet, and they melted in my mouth. My father ordered the beef wellington and said it was the best he had ever had. My boyfriend had the filet and it was cooked perfectly. Our meal came out all at the same time so no waiting around for someone to get their meal, especially with such a large party. Plus, since it was my birthday, the waiter brought out vanilla ice cream in a chocolate magician's hat for dessert. What a treat! The meal was absolutely one of the best I have ever had.Now for the magic! I won't give too much away because I believe you have to go to the Magic Castle to believe how spectacular it is, but every show was amazing. There are magicians around the Castle who are not doing set shows in the rooms who are also incredible. We saw a few magicians who we recognized from the Trick Penn & Teller show. Overall we were very impressed with the high quality magic that was happening all throughout the castle.The only complaint I have is that it gets really hot in the rooms. Some of the rooms are small (for the up close magic, of course), and very stuffy. Plus when you have a lot of bodies in there, it can get really very hot. I nearly fainted during one show, but the staff who helped me out were extremely kind and caring. I appreciated their help a lot - but I would definitely recommend ladies wear clothing that breathes a bit better to avoid the heat in some of the areas of the castle.This was by far one of the best experience of my life, and I truly look forward to going to the magic castle again. Thank you for making my birthday special!",5 star rating
647,7/12/2018,If you like magic there is no better magicians in the world than at the Magic Castle. If you enjoy a great 5 star restaurant you will love the Magic Castle. The food is awesome! Everything on the menu is great! I had the rack of lamb which was perfect. The other people in my party had a huge rib eye steak and it was awesome.  I suggest the lemon sorbet for dessert. There are several magic shows and every one of them were amazing. These magicians compete in world magic competitions and you will see magic you have never seen before.  I highly recommend the Magic Castle!,5 star rating

649,3/10/2014,"Open sesame! -- the magic word. I've had the opportunity to visit the magic castle several times thanks to my wonderful magician friend.  tvomagic.com/abouttam.ht…  #tamvomagic Things to know when coming to the castle:Invite only--You must get an invite in order to come to the castle. Admission is generally free but if the magician hit the number of comps for the night you may end up handing over $20-$30 to enter. You can avoid this if you have dinner reservations. Follow the dress code! It's a must that guys dress in suits! Do not try to go to pull the jeans and blazer look. They will not let you in. You must wear dress pants! Ladies must wear a cocktail dress. Do not come in ""clubbing"" attire. That is just tacky. Parking- It's valet only. $8No pictures once you enter the door. They are very strict with this policy. Members of the castle are there and will give you the stink eye if they catch you taking pictures. There are a few bars throughout the castle for you drinking pleasure. Enjoy the show!",5 star rating

You cannot go to the magic castle and expect to not spend money. It is a one of a kind place in Hollywood for crying out loud! So everyone that is on here complaining about the price,knew what they were getting themselves into before hand and still chose to go.It is invite only and I went on a Thursday night and saw many shows before and after dinner because it was not too crowded which was nice.

652,11/20/2013,"The hub and I were fortunate enough to dine and take in a show at the exclusive Magic Castle thanks to the very generous and super sweet, Nelson F. We ended our Anniversary weekend here with a lovely dinner and a great show. No NPH sighting, but we still had a great time :DSituated in the Hollywood Hills, the Magic Castle is a beautiful old mansion that has been made into a magician and magic lovers paradise. The only way to gain entrance is by being a member or being invited by one. There is a dress code that requires all guests to attend in formal attire. Parking is done by mandatory valet and there will also be an admittance fee, but it's all very worth it.Due to previous reviews about the food we didn't arrive expecting much, but to our surprise it was better than we expected. We have had better, but it certainly wasn't the worst. It cost around the same as any 5 star dining experience will run, but tastes about the same as what you would expect at any chain restaurant that belts out the ""Happy Birthday"" song every 5 min. You're not here for the food though, so... Even though the food wasn't the best, the atmosphere and privilege of being inside the castle made it more than justifiably a 5 star experience. Non-members must first dine at their restaurant upstairs in order to partake in the magic shows. After dinner you are given a ticket to their main show which guarantees seating. We went on a night Murray SawChuck was performing. You may know him from being on America's got Talent and Pawn Stars. His performance was more comedic than it being magical, but we still found it entertaining. They also have close-up magic throughout the castle which we were unable to view due to time constraints and limited seating. I'm hoping we get another chance to visit and watch the close-up magic because I heard those are the shows to watch. Now I just need to find a way into Club 33...",5 star rating
653,10/21/2014,"I've been to the Magic Castle many times. It's fun and a cool experience... but pricey. I've been here twice for Halloween, another time for a friend's birthday, and again last night. To get into this ""exclusive"" Magic Castle, you have to be a member or know someone, either a member or a magician member to get you a guest pass or you can go in with them. If you go in with a member, you do not have to pay an extra entrance fee unless it's a special occasion night. Parking is valet only. It used to be $10, now it is $13. Members park for $3. Regular entrance fee without a member is $30, on special occasions like Halloween, it is $50! Also, if you go in without a member, you HAVE to eat dinner here... that's about another $30 at the least for the cheapest entree. Entree prices vary from $30 to $50 and it states that EACH person MUST order 1 entree minimum. Eating dinner will also grant you a ticket to the Palace of Mystery, the big showroom that they have. If you enter with a member, dinner is not required and NO entrance fee, which will save you LOTS of money. Find a member to go with if you can!I've been twice for Halloween on Halloween for the last 2 years. First time I lucked out and was able to get in for just $30 and not have to eat dinner! Second year, had to pay $50 AND eat dinner at the Magic Castle. I had the beef wellington  for $33. It was good and tender! I would order that again. Halloween is a cool time to visit the castle, but know that it will be packed to capacity!! Last year for Halloween, they had a photo booth which was awesome! You are not allowed to take pictures at the Magic Castle, including pictures of your food... so my friends and I took advantage of the photo booth!! The castle is decorated and there is a coffin at the entrance with candy... but beware, there is someone hiding underneath and ready to grab your hands when you get candy!! Also, on Halloween, it is mandatory to wear costumes and there is a costume contest as well. Apparently Ryan Goesling and Eva Mendes was in attendance last year!! The non-Halloween time I went was for a friend's birthday. We paid $30 each to get in and also were required to eat dinner. This time I had a prime rib -about $40. It was tender and tasty... but not really worth the price tag... I wouldn't mind having to eat dinner here, but being required to pay both an entrance fee and eat dinner here, plus parking can add up really fast! I don't remember if it was a weekday or weekend, but it was much less packed than Halloween! I enjoyed it more because there was more room to walk around and getting into shows was much easier. The most recent time I went was just last night, with my friend, who is now a member. We ate dinner because she wanted tickets to make sure we were able to see Shimada (Japanese magician) who was only performing yesterday and today.  If you don't have tickets  you have to be in a standby line, and since he was making a special appearance, eating dinner and getting tickets were the way to go. They recently changed their menu having a new chef now, so the menu online is not the updated menu yet. I tried the rosemary chicken this time. It was $30 for a PARTIAL chicken breast. For what I got, it was expensive! The chicken was just okay... it came with potatoes au grain and some veggies. For the price, I prefer the prime rib or beef wellington... I was also disappointed that I HAD to ask for water... The complimentary bread is a sweet type of cinnamony bread. Since I came in with my friend who is a member, there was no entrance fee to pay and we were not required to eat dinner there either. It was more packed than usual for a Monday night because of the special performance by Shimada... but with some planning, we were able to see all of the acts that night! Anyways, the Magic Castle is a cool place that I think everyone should check out if possible. It is a pricey experience... but then again, you are paying for dinner and a show, expect to spend at least $80/person if you do not go with a member. There are 4 main showrooms: the Close-up gallery; Parlour of Prestidigtation, the Palace of Mystery; and the Peller Theatre. There are different shows that go on till 1230am. Just grab a schedule on the way in to see who is performing at what times. During more busy times, there are also acts in the bar downstairs. Also, throughout the night, you can randomly meet different magicians who like to showcase their acts at the various tables. It's like getting a private show!  All the magicians are pretty amazing and even in the close up gallery when they are doing the acts in front of your face, you will still be amazed!

655,2/2/2015,"Definitely fun times and if you are fortunate enough to have a way to visit  it is definitely something to experience at least once. The place is serious about their dress code. In a time and place where proper attire has really gone out the window, this place is a breath of fresh air. The guy at the door even reminded me to button up my top button which I had undone on the drive up since my tie was strangling me.But I really haven't heard anyone tell me that since game day Fridays back in high school.. and no that's not 50 years ago.. it's just 15 hahaAnyhow, the castle is a little deceiving size wise, the view from the street all these years told me it was a huge castle, but when you drive up it ends up looking like a movie prop. Then you get inside and it starts small, but there are quite a few places to explore once inside. As people have said, the entry is through a bookcase via the password spoken to a golden owl. That owl reminded me of the one from the OG Clash of the titans... Bubo was his name I think.  I had that thought in my mind as we went in .. Had to laugh a little at that one.( how many of you know about Bubo? It's ok if you don't)  Oh well I was the only one laughing when I mentioned it aloud that night. The magic shows were a lot of fun and the castle magicians really get you involved. I was asked to draw a picture not visible to the magician (or so he said) which he guessed correctly of course and for another show I had to give a standing applause kind of on command because of a stupid answer I gave the magician .. it was a lot of fun, I will spare the details and allow you to experience the place yourself. The dinner was good. We ordered the grilled Colorado rack of lamb and the 21 day aged rib eye. Our entrees came with mashed potato and veggies already so we did not order any sides. Overall the food was good, we were seated at a table positioned in the back corner of what seemed like the main dining room. The table had been named after an old movie star (I'll edit this when I remember) but that table was a perfect quiet corner for us to talk and hear our own conversation. This night, dinner seemed to be on the louder side, and that's pretty bad for me to say because I think I'm going deaf.. EDIT: Cary Grant table, boy I'm dumbAgain, overall fun times. We went as a couple but I can see this being a really great group activity. My invite was good enough for a total of 8 but our trip was last minute. Bring friends, drink a little, laugh a lot, have a great time ... Make it home safe Note: Valet is easiest and to me is the only way to park here. Nobody wants to hike up a hill in nice clothes.

657,7/19/2014,"The idea of dressing up and combining dinner and a magics show,that was held w/ utmost exclusivity sounded like a magical carpet ride that I couldn't wait to get on.First off, the food was really not as bad as I thought. I was expecting the worse but it was decent, just a bit expensive for the quality. Our fav dish was the coconut lobster bisque, it was so nice and hearty. The fiancée who can't handle heat too well slurped it all up, and would not have turned down a bucket more if given the opportunity. The ribeye was good, but a bit dry since there was no marbling. Now onto the magic shows. I felt like it was very amature-ish acts. I can't believe some even passed magic school. The acts were so bad people were literally falling asleep! Maybe I've been spoiled w/ David Copperfield and David Blaine, but I just don't get how some people were so easily amused (maybe it was the alcohol, that made them lose all sense of reality and made to believe, that the tricks actually were not a figment of their imagination).I also don't know why it was so stuffy and claustrophobic feeling. It wasn't only just me that felt that way. Iono..I guess it was a ok experience, but not something I would be dying to try again.",3 star rating
658,3/12/2017,"The Magic Castle is just...how do you say it...hmmm...let me find the right word...MAGICAL. Yep, that's right magical. Every nook and cranny has a story here. The magicians are so approachable and kind. The drinks are en pointe and dinner...oh the magical heavens have conjured up some epicurean amazingness to consume. Be warned, dress code is very strict. So make sure to double check the attire checklist on their website.",5 star rating
659,12/16/2015,"I have been here four times - and although it is not the most amazing experience on Earth - it is pretty damned close.There is no other place that I know of, in Los Angeles, or anywhere, that offers what this place offers --- a chance to experience many different levels of slight-of-hand, and large-scale-magic-tricks, performed by dozens of magicians, in the historic opulence of what was once a great Hollywood mansion.It may not be a cheap evening - but it will be an evening that you will never forget.Unfortunately, you must be a professional magician and member of the club, or you must be friends with a ""member"" of the club to get in. That said --- lots of magician-members offer their exclusive invites over the internet to those who they have met and who reach out sincerely.Do it - and the food is good (actually really good) in case you stay for dinner. The hall on the way to the restaurant has many historic photographs and posters from the world's great magicians like Houdini. Guests under 21 are welcome at the Castle for brunch on Saturday and Sunday but evening guests must be 21 or older unless (1) it is a specified Young Adult Night, of which there are four or five a year or (2) special permission has been granted by management.Trust me - its worth it",5 star rating
660,4/28/2014,"Wow! My experience here was FANTASTIC!It's such an interesting part of LA that I was fortunate enough to visit, so thank you to our magician friend for the invite!The food is alright, but the drinks are spectacular and they definitely encourage you to get your fill! It's an incredibly unique building with many hidden passage-ways. One thing I will have to say is, one of the front desk attendees was very rude: in fact, she was cursing with the other female attendee and then rudely let us in. You're in the service industry (and I have worked there as well), so if you don't have something nice to say...keep your mouth shut. Despite the hostile introduction to the festivities, my boyfriend and I had an amazing time! Even left with a memorable souvenir from the performing magician!",5 star rating
661,4/15/2018,"Not impressed at all. Been looking forward to the place and the restaurant. Service was ok, just ok. Food arrived one undercooked and one extra over cooked.

The Longer shows are funny and nice.",3 star rating
662,7/12/2018,Came to Magic castle and brought my family from Boston and had amazing time. The embiance and History is worth going in itself the shows are unreal. Also even while are not at a show the magicians engage you on an almost private setting. I remember el Ropo had us sit at our table and not only had some fantastic talent; also told an excellent story and engaged all of us. One of personal favorite parts... but great place to show the family an exclusive part of Hollywood and would recommend to any. Thanks everyone for the experience.,5 star rating
663,4/9/2015,"This was the first time I've been out in the evening since I had my little boy, so I was definitely looking forward to it.  My hosiery had to work really hard to get me into a dress, but it was okay, since the only picture we took was outside in front of a faux red carpet.  The black background glared a lot, so none of the photos were super nice, anyway.  The exterior of the Castle is nice, but you can't really get it into a picture with yourself.We had dinner with friends, and I got the Avalon Shrimp, which came with a good amount of large shrimp on top of pasta and peas.  Overall, I liked the dish a lot, though for nearly $40, it better be!  The crab cakes appetizer was really good, too, not as much fillers as other places.  We also had cheese bread at the table, which was good.  My husband got the Beef Wellington, which seemed okay but not amazing.I was disappointed that nothing on the dessert menu caught my eye.  I mean, I was expecting a dessert with fireworks or that changed color or something.  So, we passed and tried to view some magic, but there was a reunion or something going on that night, so everything was packed and I (shorty) couldn't see.  Luckily, we ran into a nice magician in the hallway who entertained us with a cup/ball trick that I still can't figure out.  After that, we saw card tricks that weren't nearly as convincing.The stage show (Murray from America's Got Talent?) was a treat to watch, though of course you know it's all theatrics and angling.  We also saw a show that had to do with mental perceptions, though I have some pretty good guesses as to how that worked...I think this is definitely a must-see, though don't expect a super amazing experience.  Make sure you stay and wander around and drink so that you feel like your $30 cover charge and your $15 parking fee have been well spent.  I got tired and dizzy from people running into me and went home at 10:00.",4 star rating
664,4/22/2018,"Okay so it's kind of confusing who they let in. We went as guests of a member who left our names at the door. I thought you had to do that but there seemed to be people paying. Also website says you need dinner reservation to come but we didn't have one cause they were full so I think that's them wanting you to spend money. But the people who have dinner get priority seating to the big magic show. Anyway, all that being said I was pleasantly surprised how nice and welcoming the staff was despite the elite members only situation. There's easy valet and we care around 7 - I recommend coming early because there are so many shows to see. You also need to PLAN. Right by the bar when you walk in is the close up gallery. They open up the line 45 minutes before the show but will serve drinks while you wait in the anti chamber. These shoes only fit 25 people and are the best ones in my opinion! Upstairs is the restaurant another bar and the room for that big show as well as a medium theater. We timed it so we did one close up show, went upstairs to catch medium, and came back down to get in line for another close up show. So we were there 7-10:30 with no dinner reservation. There is also a performer in the cellar. It's a really cool space. Fun to dress up (there's real dress code! Suit and tie and dresses). Only downside is for all there seriousness people are just really drunk inside and that was kind of a bummer to be around especially if you're actually there to watch magic.",4 star rating
665,4/2/2015,"This place really is everything I imagined it to be and more! We came with an alumni group, so I didn't personally know the member who let us in beforehand, and it got quite chaotic, but I was immediately impressed with the way the lady at the front desk calmly and efficiently dealt with our disorganized group, as well as other people trying to get in. I knew it was going to be a good night.Every staff and magician I met that night are truly passionate about the history and legacy behind the Magic Castle. Everyone was well informed, and I was really astounded by all the magicians.The food was also good too! I wasn't expecting much, but I was impressed with my rack of lamb and sangria.One tip I have is to make sure you go in knowing that you can't take pictures. I'm really into my social media and I was a little sad to hear no pictures allowed (especially since I did see a celebrity inside) but I completely understand why that rule is in place. Just have fun and enjoy your experience at the castle!",5 star rating
666,3/23/2014,"Came by here for brunch with my husband and 2 of my friends to celebrate my belated birthday. Now I have no ties/ connections to Magic Castle what so ever and have learned that there are only a few ways in which you can come for a visit:1) Become a member (rather pricey though) 2) Obtain a guest pass from a member 3) Stay at the Magic Castle Hotel (which you would be able to obtain a guest pass) 4) Take magic classes at Magic Castle (that cost money, and you will be granted a temporary 6 week that allows for you to bring guests). Well after doing a little searching, I found out that you can actually request guest passes from either a magician who may be performing the week you are interested in attending (you can email him/her and ask if they would be willing to send you one since you want to go see him/her perform) or request for one from Magician Mike Wong (mikewong.com/contact_cap…), which is what I did. Anyways, now that you know how you can come to this place... like I mentioned before, I came today for brunch. The brunch is an all you can eat buffet and the food was actually very good, although the selection was small (but I rather have a smaller selection with high quality and delicious food then a lot of food choices that taste just mediocre). Some of the items that we enjoyed included crab legs, prime rib, made to order omelets, lox & mimosas. There is also chicken fingers, fries and ice cream for the little ones (not the best food choices for the kids, but just an fyi).We only saw 3 shows and 2 small little card tricks (jr magicians walk around and perform card tricks). For some reason, I was really expecting something more. I am not sure what I was expecting, but I thought there would be more. Some of the tricks just seemed a bit less exciting when I see the same tricks done by another magician (I really did see the same type of tricks by 2 different magicians). But with all magic, the allure and illusion is always intriguing. We spent some time trying to get the famous Irma ghost to play a song for us. Another group of people tried to request a song for her to play on her piano but she didn't play anything the first time around when we came by. Perhaps she was on a break or something, lol. But when we came by much later, she was playing away whatever someone requested. But one of my friend's kept trying to request her to play something but she never did :(   guess she didn't have the magic voice, lol. The castle itself is pretty neat, very vintage/ old victorian. There are quite a bit of hide- a-ways, nook and crannies to really explore and look around in, which adds to the illusion and fun of the castle. In the end, really enjoyed my time here and glad that I was able to enjoy my birthday at a special place. I have a feeling that an evening out at the Magic Castle would probably offer a different experience with more shows (maybe even better shows than the ones I saw today). Maybe I will check that out for another special occasion. By the way, just some additional notes:Cover charge for brunch (Saturday or Sunday) $15Brunch $36.95 (prior to tax, but I believe we were charged the tax and tip on our bill when we got it today)Valet $10 ($3 for members though)Dress code for brunch is a little bit more relaxed. Men can wear polo shirts and ties are optional. I saw children wearing sneakers. I also saw some women wear casual sandals (flip flops are not allowed though). If coming for brunch, best to RSVP for the 11 am brunch so you can check out the other shows. When we arrived this morning at 10:30 am, they started letting people come in earlier than 11 am, which was nice so that we could make it to the 1st show at 12:15 pm.Lastly, the secret phrase to get in from the lobby is ""open sesame"".Oh and since photos and filming is not allowed inside, check out this awesome behind the scenes video about Magic Castle in case you haven't been here yet and want to go (youtube.com/watch?v=WLWw…)",4 star rating
667,3/14/2016,"Great place for a night out. Depending on the magician, you might even get a little comedy in the show. Very entertaining!-Parking is valet: 13 per vehicle for non-members-Admission is 30$ per guest on weekends, 20$ for weekdays-Enter by saying ""open sesame"" at the bookshelf. Make sure you say it loud/clear enough or you'll be repeating yourself a handful of times in front of the others behind you in line (yes, that happened... I also think someone controls that door haha)-This castle is exclusive for members only, so I love that it provides for a more personal/intimate experience -Food is not bad, I'd rate it a solid 7/10. 18% gratuity charge to parties of 6 or more-Look at the show times to plan your route for the night (you can grab a pamphlet at the front desk). All shows are first come first serve for seating*If you don't make it in time for a show there are magicians performing small tricks at the side tables-Dress code is strictly enforced! Men must have a jacket, dress shoes, and tie! They have tie loaners at the front desk if you seem to have forgotten. Ladies, cocktail attire or pant suit with jacket can work. -No photography allowed in the castle once you pass the bookshelf-There are several bars throughout the castle. The one by the front entrance is usually the crowdiest-Drinks range around 10$ each-Professional photographs are 20$ a pop! But along with that you get another invitation to come back.-Restrooms are really cute. Some of them even talk to you o.o-If you have time, get a tour of the castle!

669,12/30/2013,"Pricey but fun night out. I read through a lot of reviews and wasn't expecting much of the food or the magic but was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Most of the magicians were pretty entertaining and a lot of freelance magicians are at the venue and do a lot of fun impromptu shows. We had went once years ago for brunch (it was not buffet at that time) and we were not very impressed with the food or the shows. The dinner and evening shows were much more enjoyable. It is not something I can afford to do regularly but fun once every now and then.Harry Houdini cut prime rib ($35): The meat was good and the sauce that came on the side was tasty. The dish also comes with mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables, same as the ones on the lobster tail special. Lobster tail special ($38): Two lobster tails, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables. The mashed potatoes were tasty and so were the vegetables. I also tried a bite of the filet mignon special ($39) and that was also very good. The filet had a nice seasoning to it. Summary of costsValet parking: $3 for members, $10 for non-membersDoor charge as of December 2013: $15 lunch, $20 Sun-Thurs dinner, $25 Fri-Sat dinnerNew door charges as of 2014: $20 Mon-Thurs dinner, $30 Fri-Sun dinnerBrunch: $36.95 for adult buffet lunch, $19.95 for kids, no charge for kids under 3Dinner: See menu. One entree required per non-memberTips-On a busy night, you need to line up 45 minutes before the show starts to get a seat (Close-up gallery and Parlour)-The schedule on the Magic Castle website is really outdated. There are a lot more shows than the times listed on the web. -No photos allowed once you go past the lobby. You can take some photos in front of the Magic Castle (they even have a backboard set up) and in the lobby.-Early dinner reservations can be hard to get for weekends. Call in advance to get earlier seatings. You can also show up before the actual time and they will seat you if there is availability.-Explore the castle. They only have four defined areas on the program but we discovered little rooms with magicians doing great shows in the bar downstairs, the ""classroom"" downstairs, and in various corners.",4 star rating

673,11/17/2013,"The thing is, I don't rate a museum based on their restaurant just like I don't rate a restaurant based on the thrift store art on their walls.  But if that museum, say, makes it a requirement that you eat at their restaurant, then it's free game.Magic Castle, first off, is awesome.  Just a total wacky experience I recommend to everyone because honestly I don't know where you could get something like it.  It's like a theme park except everyone's in expensive clothes and it doesn't smell like children's vomit.  The magic shows are adorable and hilarious.  One of the shows was in a tiny room (like, 13 people packed tight) with the cutest old man I have ever encountered doing amazing things with magic coins.  Then there's the little shows going on at the tables everywhere, things you'd probably miss if someone didn't point them out.And then.  There's the restaurant.  Fucking up mac and cheese is hard, making it unappetizing is harder, charging $9 for it is just downright ballsy.  Same goes for charging $40 for Ralphs defrosted beef.  And I don't know what went into the lobster bisque, but it certainly wasn't from any ocean I've been to.Honestly, I want to give this a 5, but if you're gonna subject people to $40 of diner food after they've already shelled out AT LEAST $30 to get into the goddamn place, you've gotta be sitting on biggest, baddest balls of all time.Thing is, that might be part of the charm.  The cramped old theater building with the eccentric members and terrible food.  Snooty, pushy but somehow entertaining.  It kind of feels very...LA.",3 star rating
674,4/16/2014,"Had a fantastic and magical time at the legendary Magic Castle! My family and I had been invited to experience and evening at the manor.  It was about a month or two after their 50th anniversary!We went on a Thursday night (it gets crazy crowded and busy on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays I hear) and it was still packed full by the time we finished our dinner.We arrived around opening which is about 6pm, and had a seat at the main bar.  I ordered my usual (Jameson and ginger) and talked while enjoying the ambiance. We had dinner reservations for 6:30. We were sat at a special table in the far corner near a beautiful window and portrait. This was nice because it was somewhat secluded from all the other hustle and bustle in the dining area.  Dinner was FABULOUS, although I forget what I ordered because I was already 3 drinks in. I do remember there was a chopped salad involved somewhere in there.After dinner we headed back downstairs and saw a few shows. The cherry on top was David Sandy's magical performance.. and I got chosen to be LEVITATED! That's right folks, I was chosen to get my patootie on stage and float in mid air! He helped me up on a long wooden board, i Layed down with my arms crossed and closed my eyes! It was the craziest feeling ever! All i could hear was music and the audience clapping!SOO CRAZY!After the show we went into the lounge where the ghost Irma plays the piano for the guests. All you have to do is request a song and she will play! Its fantastic.. be weary though, towards the end of the night Irma has had too much to drink and she will just play whatever the hell she wants, and a bit sloppily too. I don't think people mind much because mostly everyone is sloppy! Overall I cannot wait to be invited back to the castle. It was fun and unforgettable!

675,5/9/2018,"I've been to the Magic Castle several times with friends, and have enjoyed the experience, but not the price.In order to visit the Magic Castle you have to be a guest of someone who is a Magic Castle member.  Once you cross that hurdle, whip out your wallet and watch your money disappear!  To enter the Magic Castle the cost is $25 per person, and $15 for valet parking (only option).  Dinner for two is about $125.  Cocktails are about $15 each.There are three main shows; the Close-up Gallery, Parlour of Prestidigitation, and the main show the Palace of Mystery.  Make sure to schedule your arrival time and your dinner reservations so that you can see all of the shows.  The lines for the two smaller shows start forming about 30-45 minutes before the show.  Priority is given to those who ate at the dinning room for the main show at the Palace of Mystery.This is a formal event.  Men must wear tie and business jacket, and females must also wear formal attire.No pictures are allowed inside the Magic Castle.  There are a couple of photo op spots outside of the Magic Castle.If you have never visited the Magic Castle and you have the opportunity it's worth the first time experience.  Beyond that is has to be a special evening with family and friends to drop that much cash.",3 star rating

I would give zero stars if i could for our waiters.  Dinner service was subpar and I felt like our waiter was pissed off the entire night.  I didn't see him smile at us once.  We were served bread only on request and had to eat beard without plates since he took them away because we didn't order appetizers.   He just stared at us placing bread directly on the table and walked away.  I had to get his attention multiple times to grab us plates.I don't usually complain and we were a nice group of people trying to enjoy dinner.  But when you have rude waiters serving you dinner, it will ruin your night no matter how great the magic shows are.  Don't waste your money eating dinner here.",2 star rating

678,1/29/2017,"Was lucky enough to be invited to this exclusive place! Our dinner was set for 9:45pm and we arrived around 7:30pm. Def not enough time!If you have enough time, go early and take the tour. You really have to know your way around to make good use of your time. My family and I wandered for a while before we finally had to ask for help. Also, there are a bunch of small shows you can enjoy before dinner, but seeing as I went on a busy Saturday night, they suggested we get in line for shows a good 30 min before they start. We were only able to fit in one show before dinner - Chris Funk was very funny and entertaining, and his tricks were amazing. After that, all the 9:15pm shows were too packed so a worker suggested we go to the improv room downstairs in ""the cellar"". There, my mind was read! And we watched 3 magicians perform for about 10-15 min each. Valet is right out front for $13. Very convenient.Their food was delicious. We had the prime rib, filet mignon, beef Wellington, and short ribs. All the meat was cooked to perfection! Also must try's are their garlic cheese bread and molten chocolate cake (with a side of ice cream). That cake was extreeeemely light and moist. I can't even explain how good it was. Lastly was ""The Palace of Mystery"" show. You get the tickets for this show after dinner. Our showing started at 11:30pm so I was pretty tired by then and I was definitely let down. Don't be fooled by the impressive introduction given to Jeff McBride. His performance was very corny and the tricks were not at all amazing. You can see the truth behind pretty much everything he did.. and it was very obvious! The best part of his show was his slight of hand card tricks.. but even then, the tricks weren't that special. Not sure why they hype him up so much and give him a whole 45min to perform. I did, however, get called up onto stage and had a good laugh. Overall, I had a great time here! Definitely worth the splurge, so don't be afraid to buy a couple of drinks and just enjoy the magic!",4 star rating
679,3/26/2014,"I have been here several times and I love it. Keep in mind that they are VERY strict about the dress code, it is $25 dollars per person at the door, dinner (at least one entrée per person) is required, no photography is allowed inside the Magic Castle and alcohol makes the magic better!!This is a great place to go with a group of friends, but keep in mind it will be an expensive evening. --but totally worth it-- I suggest avoiding Friday and Saturdays if you want to see more than one show. Dinner is mandatory if you are not a member and unfortunately it is pretty mediocre and overpriced. Corkage is $25/each 750ml bottle, which isn't too bad if you have something nice you'd like to bring from your cellar. At the end of dinner, you'll get a ticket for the main show. You'll want to rush right over after dinner and wait in line, if you want to see it. The main show will empty out into the line of the next show at the Parlor, which is my favorite of the three. There is usually a magician at the small table outside of the show, which you should stop by and see. They're great!End off your night with Irma the piano playing ghost. Her room is right behind the main bar where you enter. You can call out for Irma to play any song for you and she does! Make sure to put a tip in the birdcage for the talented ghost!",4 star rating

681,7/17/2016,"Scenario: went here on a Friday night.The only way (that I hear) to get inside is that you need to know a magician or you need to book a room at the hotel, and have dinner at the castle. (Or have a membership)With that said, however you get in, you won't be disappointed. Inside is somewhat of a maze. There are 5 bars, and magicians all over the place, that are parked near the bars.I suggest you get there early, say 6pm. This way, you can have small intimate shows with the magicians. They have a variety of rooms that have scheduled magicians.. And a grand show, which. You'll need tickets to.The magic is top notch. A lot of card, coins, and rope tricks, but everyone is different. Everyone is entertaining and I had a really enjoyable time. Men: dress up in suits = required Ladies: dress up in your best, because everyone else will beDinner was good. I ordered the tomahawk prime rib, clam chowder and some appetizers. Food was delicious but I am not a foodie, so I am sure foodies have their own opinion. Be sure to bring some $10 dollar bills to tip some of the bar magicians if you really like their show. If you go there to be entertained, you will. Hands down that this will be one of the best date spots in LA.Also, no photography or selfies are allowed in the castle, or you'll get kicked out I think. Obey that simple rule and go enjoy it. Don't do selfies in the bathroom, apparently I saw some. Dumb, if you want to do a group pic, the host can do it in the lobby for you (the only place)",5 star rating

We got lucky enough to see Simon Coronell at the end of the night in a near intimate setting, and he blew our minds. Well he and 2 of his partners, however I hate myself for not being able to remember their names. Simon blew our minds with Poker Chips and Cards, another one of his counter parts had some amazing tricks with balloons and made me crack up with his ready to go confetti, and the last guy had some awesome illusions with a quarter. I really hate that I don't remember all their names! Before sitting with those 3, an older gentleman by the name of Jack had amazing tricks and illusions with playing cards, and sponge bunnies. And the other magicians name I remember is Rich Freeman which also had some awesome illusions with cards. The magic castle is without a doubt special, and though yes its all illusions, it doesn't mean it won't trip you out and make you have a great time!

687,1/25/2015,"This place was definitely an experience I'll remember. If you're ever lucky enough to check this place out, you're in for a treat! When you first pull up to the Magic Castle, the valet greets you and you wait in line to enter. I went on a Saturday with my wife and our brothers and sisters. The place opened at 5PM and we got there a little after that. I would recommend getting there on time or even earlier as it did get busy even though they just opened up.When we finally got in, there was a lobby and a really small gift shop. We paid for admittance and then said the magic words ""open sesame"" to enter. Our dinner wasn't til 6PM so we got drinks at the bar. They had a lounge with some parlor magic tricks going on but it got full. That's why I would recommend going as early as you can to get the most out of this place.DINNER:Dinner was surprisingly better than what I expected after reading the reviews on here. We got the truffle fries for appetizers. It was okay. Not the greatest. I ordered a 14oz steak. I can't remember the name but it was pretty delicious. The dinner was pretty pricey, but since this was a rare occasion I guess it was worth it. We were celebrating my birthday as well so they offered champagne or a slice of cheesecake to me. I got the cheesecake and it was pretty good and a nice addition to the meal. The service was really good and the food was better than expected. Because we ate dinner here, we got a ticket to the 8:30PM magic show. Since it was a busy weekend, at least we were guaranteed a seat.After dinner, we walked around to go see some of the different areas and shows. Because it was so busy and packed, the wait times were really long and you needed to be in line way in advance before the show even started. This was the only thing I didn't like was the wait and being so crowded. I thought it was a more exclusive place but it didn't seem like it from the inside.We got to watch a few magic shows and up close magic tricks. The shows were really good and an experience I'll never forget. If you ever get the chance to be invited here, make sure to come and experience this for yourself!",5 star rating
688,5/20/2016,"The Magic Castle is one of those otherworldly places that you feel can only exist in some kind of fantasy novel or movie. From the exclusivity of the entry requirements, the strict dress code, odd characters and the fact it looks like an actual castle the mystery that surrounds this famous Hollywood club is what makes it so wonderful.If (like myself) you are fortunate enough to know one of the members and can score yourself an invitation it is one of the best nights out you will ever, ever experience! I have visited the castle twice now and it gets better each time I manage to step through those heavy front doors.First things first- this isn't some second rate, bottle service club where you can get away with wearing expensive looking sneakers. You HAVE to dress up! For Gentlemen- suits, ties and jacket/tuxedo's, 40's style suits, leather dress shoes. Whatever it is it HAS to be almost black tie. Ladies- Heels, cocktail dresses or classy suits. They will not let you in wearing jeans, zippered jackets or anything else similar. Be aware- Military dress (not fatigues) and religious attire is accepted :)Also- be prepared to pay a cover charge. On my first visit I went with my Mother for her birthday and we had a dinner reservation for 6.30pm. It was $30 each as we went on a Friday evening and it was also required we purchase an Entree each during the dinner sitting. As long as you are aware of the charges there will be no nasty surprises and you will be able to enjoy your night! Oh, PS Absolutely NO photography is allowed inside the castle. They will kick you out if they see you taking happy snaps.Right- now all the rules are out of the way let me fill you in on the EXPERIENCE!Once your ID has been checked, you've walked into the foyer and paid you cover charge there is a book case to your left with a creepy looking owl statue. This is your entry! Simply say the ""magic words"" and the book case will slide open and admit you to the castle. If you are coming for dinner make sure you get an early sitting, the castle is deceptively large and there is a lot of exploring to be done! As well as the main magic show (which you will receive tickets for if you are dining) there are a heap of other shows running as well as spontaneous magic being done by members floating around the castle, the bar tenders and also some of the servers! Try and plan your evening by using the program available to you on the night, the Theatre of Prestidigitation (did I say that right?! haha) is by far my favourite theatre. It also seems the have the craziest magicians!My dining experience at Magic Castle was nothing short of breathtaking! I eat out a lot and aside from Chateau Marmont, I have never experienced food this delicious in Los Angeles. Because it was my Mother's birthday we splurged a little and ordered a bunch of food:Our appetiser was the Four Cheese Garlic Bread... and it was indeed exceedingly cheesy, which is exactly how I like my cheesy garlic bread! For Entree Mum got the Beef Wellington (which was exceptional) and I had the Colorado Rack of Lamb, cooked to perfection might I add! It was a birthday so despite how full we were dessert HAD to happen! We ordered the Creme Brulee to share and it was so yummy! As a surprise, in honor of the birthday girl, the waiters also brought us a huge slice of Red Velvet Cake and a free glass of Champagne! That was something we did not expect and it was so, so lovely of them. It really got our evening off to a wonderful start!The magic at Magic Castle is absolutely world class, any night of the week there are countless magicians performing and all of them are ridiculous. My absolute favourite was a performer I saw on my second visit- Rob Zabrecky. It was the most entertaining performance, very macabre/Edgar Allen Poe style character but comedic and also stupidly incredible magician!Every time I come to the Castle I never want to leave, especially when I go into the downstairs bar and play with Irma- the magical piano. Name any song and she will play it!Beg, borrow, steal, sell your wife/husband/first born/favourite cat but DO get yourself an invite in to this magical, magical place.",5 star rating
689,3/4/2014,"Like being probed by an alien ... after my night at the Magic Castle I had to step back and ask myself, 'Whoa? What just happened?' I wasn't sure if I loved my experience or hated it. I've since thought about it and I guess I liked it.I am not a member of the Society. I stayed at the Hotel, so that got me into the restaurant. Well, that and $20 on a Thursday. I have to say, if they didn't charge this cover ... I would have given 5 stars. The food in the restaurant was at best wedding reception food and at worst, low grade dog food (always wanted to use that Caddyshack line) and you are REQUIRED to order an entree at the restaurant to get access ... or be charged $50 if you don't.The first thing I noticed is that the best trick in the place seems to be that all the nerdy guys in High School have figured out how to score a hot chick at the Magic Castle. Looking around, it was like a secret society of dorks with hot girlfriends. Apparently, magic is where it is at! The dudes in the place looked like they belonged at a Band Camp while the girls looked like they belonged in a Strip Club. Bonus eye candy to look at in between the magic!The first thing you need to do if it is your first time at the Magic Castle is form a plan about the showtimes. The smaller shows (close up magic shows) fill up fast. If you are not in line 30 - 40 minutes before the show ... the spots dissapear and they put up a 'show filled sign'. I did a 9:45 p.m. dinner time which was a big mistake. Luckily, I was told to show up an hour or two early before dinner because it gave me time to see some shows.You can wander the castle and will come across little parlours and spaces where magicians are doing magic tricks. Most of them are card tricks ... however, some use other props. The fellow at the bar downstairs was doing some slight of hand/pick pocket type of tricks and was quite good. There was another one doing card tricks at a small table next to the 'museum hallway'. Yet another in a cowboy hat was doing rope tricks at a table near the main show areas.This might be one of the best places for a first date ever invented. Seriously, there are bars ... dinner ... places to sit and break the ice ... and if the conversation stalls, there are umpteen magic shows to watch.The dinner is the sucky part of the evening. Most things are VERY pricey and the food is no better than mass produced wedding reception food. $50 for a steak that tastes like it was served at a high school prom. The lobster bisque soup tasted like Campbells Soup and drinks are double what they would be at a bar on the Boulevard. They get you coming or going here ... and the waitors are good at pushing the extras on you. ($8 garlic bread ... $10 desserts). Once you get through the dinner ... things get better.The decor of the castle feels like a movie set. Cheesy red velvet drapes everywhere, low lighting, ornate carved Victorian bars and fainting couches. You feel as though you are in the movie Clue and there are plenty of nooks and crannies to explore.A few of the magicians did the same tricks as each other. (which probably holds true for magic groupies as well) The main show was okay ... it was a magician and his assistant who made doves appear and dissapear and did some cool tricks. The best magician was at the end in the smaller theater. He mixed stand up comedy with magic and brought the house down. By far the best part of the evening.If you are in town and can get into the Magic Castle, I recommend you try it. I wouldn't necessarily join the society to get access ... but then again, it is a great date place. If you are making bank in your job, don't have a gym body and are single ... I suggest joining Match dot com and taking your dates here. There is nowhere quite like it and it is SURE to be the best date she's been on. Probably your best bet to get a second date. Sure beats Applebees.I love the fact there is a dress code (jacket and tie ... no jeans). The fact that everyone is dressed up adds to the atmosphere a lot.",4 star rating
690,4/27/2016,The magic castle!!! What an experience!!!First off pricing-Dinner- me and my wife had an entree each with 2 alcoholic drinks and dessert as well. Bill was 176$ with tip. Not to bad!!! Food was great I had the ribeye!!!Entrance fee 20$/per person plus 13$ valet.The magic shows-We saw a totally of three shows in fact Chris Mitchell was our first performer and by far the best!!! He couldn't have been funnier and tricks were awesome as well. It's definitely a great time!! I would definitely come back!!!Now for the reason they got four stars! Our waiter was horrible. Rude and gave no attention to us. In fact in the middle of us ordering he said hang on need to finish another tables order. It's like you should have finished theres then come to ours.Other then that banana cream pie was off the chart!!!!!,4 star rating
691,8/11/2015,"When I was invited to the Magic Castle, I wasn't absolutely sure what to expect.  A private club with an exceedingly chic dress code, démodé but mysterious demeanor, and brilliant magicians?  It almost sounds like a grandiose wizardry trick waiting to happen.After bypassing all the hosh-posh of valet and door service we paid the cover charge and approached the suspicious bookshelf.  ""Open Sesame"" was whispered, the door didn't open.  Once again, ""Open Sesame,"" still the shelf refused to budge.  Then finally someone roared ""OPEN SESAME!"" and the door finally opened and we were immediately greeted by a senescent but classy bar.The bar has a drink menu but for those who are privy to drinks, feel free to ask.  I myself had an old fashioned and would recommend it, however, there was another drink that blew it away.  I had a sip of Mai's Fireball with Rumchata and the best way to describe it was a fiesta of cinnamon and liquor.We make our way around the corridors and passage ways.  There are plenty of bars littered around the premises and plenty of magicians around to do tricks for small crowds that gather.  We set our sights to our first show, Mr. Stryker, a card illusionist.  Olin (chuckle) was chosen to be a volunteer and magic ensued.  Although quite a small space, the show was entertaining and left us scratching our heads.  Any doubts of having actors participate was squelched as our friends were being selected to participate.We were lucky enough to be approached by a 90 year old French gentleman that graciously gave us a tour of the Magic Castle.  During the tour we learned about the worldly decor and greeted Edna, a mysterious invisible pianist that could play any song that came to mind.  We traversed up a floor and down a floor, through cellars, and past paintings and props.  The Magic Castle is full of history, down to every portrait and every stained glass window.At the end of our tour we were confronted by a mentalist who attested to being able to read an individual's mind and manipulate their senses.  He was successful, he was able to do everything he claimed to members of my group and for his finale, was able to transfer the feeling of touch from one person to another! (mind blown).We were quite famished at this point and it was time for our 8:00 PM dinner reservation (which comes with a 'big' show ticket).  There was a variety of complementary breads and water is strictly upon request (curse the drought).  Some of the things I tried werebeef wellington(39), porterhouse(79) (enough to feed a small country), sea-bass, and ribeye steak(39).  The food was above average, the steaks and meat was cooked well except for some caveats, the breading for the wellington was horrendous, however the beef was a nice medium rare.  For dessert we shared marcarons, which were pleasing to the eye but ended there.  One of the frequenters in my group mentioned that the food was particularly better than her last visit.  Understand that the food is good but not extraordinary and you'll be fine.After dinner we grabbed our tickets and rushed to the big show of the night, which was actually a comedy show, a circus act, and a magic performance all compiled into one performance. The 2 man act was quite comical and had us bawling, especially when one of the actors switched characters and personas to several different ones (A magician, a french juggler, a German escape artist, and a bird trainer.)  A good show to end the night.After a few more drinks and a photo-op out front.  We were on our way, leaving with the glowing eerie sight of the magnificent Magic Castle in our rear view mirrors.=======TLDR SECTION========- There are plenty of rooms and planned shows designated for the day.- Make sure you grab a pamphlet at the entrance to plan ahead for scheduled shows.- Aside from the designated shows, there are many magicians performing tricks all around the castle.- You are free to roam the castle and visit the various bars littered around.- The kitchen doesn't open until 6:00 PM, you cannot get bar food either before this time.- Dress code is strict and strongly enforced: magiccastle.com/visiting…- If you manage to get in, there is a $30 cover charge.- Valet is $13 and is required.- Dining information can be found here: magiccastle.com/visiting- (MEN) be careful when entering the restrooms nearest to the entrance, there is a death step right when you enter and you are almost guaranteed to trip on it.- For those who forget a tie, one can be provided with ID hold.- Food is good but not spectacular.===============================(end pretentiousness)",4 star rating
692,10/1/2016,"This place is always magical! Yes, it is hard to get in because you either need to know a magician and ask for a guest pass or be a member yourself which can be expensive.I was invited by a magician and this is actually my 2nd time here. They always have different magicians and the tricks are always MIND BLOWING! I came here with the wifey on a Friday (sept 30, 2016) for our 2 years anniversary and she loves it. She never been here before and had a blast. Magic castle isn't a cheap place to take your date. Depending on your reservation day, the guest entry fee can be $20 or $30 per person. They also charge a $13 valet fee to park your car. I don't know if you can find street parking or if there's any lot around, but I rather come in like a VIP than walk up that hill. They have a very strict no camera and phone policy as well as men needs to have their coat on at ALL times. We saw about 5 different shows and had to eat dinner here which do cost a lot as well. Let's not forget about buying drinks because how can you have fun if you don't have a drink? The food here was pretty good. It isn't like a five star restaurant, but I would say about a 3-4 depending on the type of entree you get. Make sure you try the garlic bread it's delicious! All their bar food is delicious too and I didn't know you could order food till I asked.If you come here don't miss out the ghost piano and there's a lot to see here. It's a magical place and it will be a blast for anyone who comes here, just remember that it costs $$$ because this isn't just any show.",5 star rating
693,12/4/2017,"Attended a holiday party here and it was such a magnificent place. I am giving four stars because of the food and restrooms. The entertainment would get 10 stars if I could. The food was a fixed menu and we had a few items to choose from. I went with the Caesar salad, salmon, and cheesecake. The lettuce on the Caesar salad was a bit bitter and tasted old. The salmon was okay, but I've had better. The cheesecake has a delicious topping that resembled creme brûlée, but the overall cheesecake was a bit warm. I'm not sure if it was sitting out for a while, but I wish it was a bit more chilled. The restrooms near the dining area were way too cramped and there was no soap. Also, the restrooms by the exit/entrance had a leak on the roof and there was no sign. I was jus waiting for a stall to open and I feel the water dripping. It was a bit gross and there was also no soap in that restroom either. Now onto the entertainment. It was MARVELOUS !!! We saw the famous clairvoyants from AGT! I was chosen to go on stage to be a part of their main act. It was such a memorable experience that I will never forget. There is no photography allowed inside, but I wish the people chosen had an opportunity to get their hands on the taping for a memory. Also saw Scott Alexander and siegfried tieber. I recommend to wait in the lines 30 minutes prior to the show time because it does get very packed for the smaller rooms.",4 star rating
694,2/14/2016,"If you haven't been to Magic Castle, then you have to go at least once!   It's like dinner and a show(s) / speakeasy / private club / comedy club / magic!   I'll skip all the details cause you have to go there to understand.   How to get invitations? 1.  Ask a magician friend2.  Don't have a magician friend?   Find out who's performing, find their website/email and nicely ask if you can get initiations to come see them.One invitation is good for 6 months, and up to 6 guest.    Make RSVP early, esp if you want a weekend.Cost:   $30/person cover charge  ,  $13 valet,  dinner reservation is required In total we spent bout 100 a person ( dinner , cover, valet, and drinks) When you get there:  Try to go to as many shows as possible, so for this i actually recommend getting the last dinner seating at 9:45, show up at 5-6, see all the smaller shows, have dinner, then enjoy the last main show (which requires tickets that are given to you after your dinner).The Shows:   There are close up and small stages , and even the largest stage was small and intimate.   The magic itself is great, but the comedy bits that go with it was even better.   Even when we could see the slight of hands or tricks, it was never cheesy, it was all in all good laughs and smiles all around.  There were tons of magician members just roaming around, watching each other's show and chatting at all corners of the house, so it def felt like we were in their club and this isn't just some fake tourist trap.  I don't know why you are still reading my review, GO!  Oh make sure u check out Irma the piano and go into the  phone booth ;)",5 star rating
695,12/30/2017,"The magic castle is a cool attraction! A lot of card tricks but I guess the reason behind it is because it's in a tight space because of everyone there.

697,5/8/2018,I highly recommend this place if you love magic and castles lol but going here feels like you're in a Harry Potter world.

699,1/7/2016,"This place is a ton of fun! First, you need to find a way in. A member may have a pass that you can use (up to 6 guests) or you can stay at the Magic Castle Hotel. There are other ways, but these two seem like the most common ways.Admission was $30 per person (paid upon entrance) and $13 for valet (mandatory).Dress code: it is enforced. Men - jackets, ties and dress shoes. Women - dresses or pant suits (no sandals). I watched people get a talking to about their attire and it had to be remedied before being admitted.For non-magicians, dinner reservations are required. They have 2-3 seating times depending on night. I suggest the 8:00pm reservation so that you can see the 10:00pm show (tickets to the show come with this dinner reservation). Meals are about $35+ and the food is good (not great).Now, the best part is the magic. I suggest getting there early if you want to see the up close shows and the Hat & Hare Bar. They open at 4:45 most days and I would get there around 5:30 or 6 to get the best bang for your bucks. The shows are a blast!!Hint: get your picture taken for $20 and get a pass to visit again (for up to 6 for Sun-Thur nights or Brunch).",4 star rating

701,7/6/2017,"I cannot tell you how sincerely disappointed I am in this establishment.  The veneer of mystery and spectacle became campy and uncomfortable.  OVERRATED.It started when we arrived with the unhappy hosts at the door and the questioning my attire.  No one said anything to me, no ""Hello"", or ""Welcome to Magic Castle""... the first thing I heard was a snarky shorter lady look me up and down and say,  ""we have a VERY strict dress code"" and effectively mentioned I am likely noncompliant... after making me twirl around a few times in front of other customers and a few other Magic Castle employees, which felt like a pat down the TSA gives out, they told me the attire was fine.  After they told me it was fine, I heard commentary about it at least 5x more, so clearly it wasn't fine, but like any establishment which seems to borrow help from some Magic Guild rather than similarly priced establishments (which they could learn a thing or two from), I guess the consistent complaining or mumbling was to be expected.  Just as an aside, I am an international businessman, I wore the same outfit in a New York board room, a conference in Brussels, a meeting in London, a client dinner in Hong Kong.  The humor that such wouldn't work for Hollywood's Magic Castle... then it did... but then I guess it really didn't, because I had to keep hearing about it, is just so classy. Classier when you see all the people around you at dinner who would be rejected from a Jean Gorges restaurant (women could probably wrap in duck tape and still get in)... Next up -- food.  Service was OK, actually very nice albeit a bit slow even when we were sitting across from the kitchen.  We sat under an oppressive light, that was a bit hot... I wanted to remove my jacket but have never felt such a fear to do this in my life, so kept it on, and perspired.  Yeah... remember that:  have you ever FEARED doing something so much at a restaurant?  I did... that sucked.  Anyway... the food.  The food and drink menu looked lovely.  I was excited to choose a number of things.  We were told of another oppressive rule that we must order an entrée... I've never been in a restaurant that required this, although perhaps there are some clientele that come and don't order an entree... weird... but it just felt like another form of unnecessary projection of control.  We all ordered various items.  The food was ok/good.   I liked the Beef Wellington, and the Entrée sized Cobb Salad was good!   The scallops were well sized and perfectly cooked.  The Shrimp Cocktail was so disappointing.... a ceviche, NOT a shrimp cocktail, that one would expect from a coat and tie steak house vibe I was getting from the restaurant (I really wanted a shrimp cocktail with just shrimp and cocktail sauce).  Also, its one of these restaurants that charge you for bread.  Again, this place is run because it doesn't trust its clientele to dress appropriately, or to order food, because I know... there are a lot of cheap people in Hollywood.  But if the invite is so hard to get, then shouldn't you expect the clientele to be able to pay?  The high pomp and rules come at the expense of anyone having a good time.  Then we moved into the show.  Lots of weirdos laughing and over gregarious in the theater... my friends and I just thought they were planted actors.  It was VERY CLEAR to us, that these people in the 'full audience' were likely planted actors, and we felt we were being practiced on and being overreacted to.  We just felt it was not genuine.We just didn't believe in the mentalists or the Taiwanese artist.  We did like the slight of hand work, which is always fun.  But we could tell the show was for the magicians to practice more....  The theater itself was tight seating.The castle itself is really cool.  I liked all the rooms and bars.  I had a terrific time talking to a piano... the magic piano was a lot nicer than most people that worked there EXCEPT for a lady named Pat who was SO SWEET and very helpful!  Anyway, all my friends were excited to hear about it... and it was very deflating to tell them that Magic Castle does not live up to the hype.",2 star rating

703,9/3/2017,"I just left the Magic Castle and was so disappointed.  This place was so revered for so many years that I think I just bought the hype.  Three of us joined a group for brunch (to the tune of more than $260) and what an amazing let down.  The food was actually pretty good but while we were still eating, one of the wait staff came up to the table and told us that we should hurry up and eat so that we would be sure to be in line 1/2 hour early for the show - and because there was another group of people who wanted to come in and eat (yes, he said that).  We gulped down the last few bites and carried our drinks with us to get out of his way.  We were in line more than early enough but there were so many people in line that we still had to stand to the side of the room for the show. I was actually embarrassed that I'd brought two friends.  The entertainment was a cross between Chuck-e-Cheese and a Frogs Bounce House only dirty.  The doors into and inside of the bathrooms were so dirty that they were sticky - you know, sticky, like the kitchen cabinets right before the grease fire that took out gramma's kitchen sticky.  The arms of the furniture were black with dirt, ground in by hoards of sweaty palms and sloughing elbows.  Yuck!!!  I actually feel sorry for the magicians because you could tell that they put effort and heart into developing their material, but the venue was rank.  So unbelievably disappointed.",1 star rating
704,9/5/2013,"This place is pure glee.  No other way to describe it.  You arrive and are immediately filled with euphoria, wonder, and delight. A family friend is a magician and a member and thus, he put me, my husband, and 2 other couples on the guest list.  Non members are required to have brunch or dinner, so we made reservations in advance.  Showed our ""ticket"" from our magician, paid our $20 entry fee, $10 valet fee, and once we said those magic words to the bookshelf owl, like magic- a secret door opened leading us to a fantastic adventure.  I felt like a kid who scored one of Willy Wonka's golden tickets.  My eyes were filled with so much amazement as I tried to drink everything in.  The dinner itself was good.  But my expectations weren't too high.  I was really there for the magic and the experience, not the food.  I ordered an entree wedge salad with chicken and my husband enjoyed his rib eye.  And of course we ordered a few round of drinks. Yum!The magic was fantastic.  We waited in line for over an hour just to get one of the 18 coveted seats to see the amazing Helder Guimaraes- the ""Parlour Magician of the Year"" .  And that wait was worth those 20 minutes of close up magic.  My brain is still melting.  There are magicians in every corner willing to showcase their skills. Most are card tricks, but some use other props.  We also went into the larger shows (40 people), but my favorite has to be those intimate ones where you really get close up, but are still baffled.  Its the work of the devil, I tell ya!! There are also bars on every floor of the castle too! And you can order more than your favorite alcoholic beverage, you can order dessert too. We arrived at 6 pm and didn't leave until 1 am. Time just flew by.  If you are able to score a coveted invitation, be sure to check their website for the rules.  They really are a stickler for them.  But I do love the dress code rule.  Do you have a dress that you love but don't really have an occasion to wear it? Well...this it! It is refreshing to attend a soiree where everyone is dressed to the nines. I love this place and I can't wait to return!

705,8/18/2013,"Invited by member only... well, if you really want to come here and experience the hype, you can internet search for a magician that will be nice to have you as their guest invitation. That's how I grabbed my tickets!Making RSVPs here wasn't too much of a pain: their phone system can be a hit or miss depending on what time of day you're calling to make reservations. I suggest calling as early as the lines are opened so you're not stuck waiting on the phone.As part of the ""experience,"" the website states that everyone is required to have dinner. Who genuinely knows if this is actually required because when we got there for our event, people were mainly ""lingering"" in and around the bars until the shows started. Regardless, there was a crowd eating dinner on a Thursday night when we visited. And be prepared to fork out money for valet at $10 and $20/pp front door charge. The food here is definitely overpriced for its taste. I had the short ribs, which was nothing to be writing home about (and that's why it gets one line here on my yelp review). The Conn man had the prime rib here and again, it was meh. Again, our experience is from the dinner. I hope their Brunch isn't as mediocre.So with just two entrees and one wine (I opted for just water), the bill ALONE was $85.00. Ouch!!! So let's see: even before seeing any magic tricks, we've already dropped $150! Hmm....Regardless of that, we actually had a blast up here in the Magic Castle! After dinner before the actual magic main events are opened, you can explore the other rooms where you'll see magicians perform slight of hand. If you're lucky like the both of us, we actually got to be participants in various magic shows! I think in total for the 4 hours that we were there, we got to see 5 acts. That's not bad. Overall, I think it's a great LA experience for anyone to see. It's nice to see people dressed up not in hoochie wear like you'd typically see in/near Hollywood, but people dressed up semi-formally to have a cheesy good time.",4 star rating
706,1/16/2014,"Yay! I finally found a magician to get me in! I had a blast. This is probably one of the last places that strictly enforces a very formal dress code, which makes for a fun evening. Be sure to read the dress code very closely. Women must be in a dress, cocktail dress, elegant skirt & blouse combination, pant suit with a matching jacket, or evening pant suit ensemble. They also allow formal military or ethnic attire. However, they do not allow leggings, outdoor or zippered jackets, polo shirts, denim (or colored denim), Capri or cut off pants, shorts, skorts, flip flops, sneakers or sneaker-like shoes are allowed.Anyway, there is a really cool ""red carpet"" type of entrance where you can take pictures with a cool backdrop. You pretty much have to valet, which is not expensive (and better than looking for parking along a hill in Hollywood). When you walk into the lobby, you pay for your valet parking and check any inappropriate attire. They keep a few coats, scarves, and other formal outerwear pieces available in case of a fashion emergency! In order to enter the castle, you must say ""open sesame"" and the door will open. That was pretty cool. Then, once you're in, you pretty much wait around for various shows to start. Our magician friend took us all the way downstairs where we learned a rule of the castle - only 1 person from your party can get up at a time (to use the restroom, to get a drink etc.). The shows are first come, first seat, so we waited nearly 90 minutes to be the first people into the first show. Then, we realized we weren't first because we weren't ""ticketed"" (i.e. our magician friend walked us in so we didn't have to pay for dinner). We ended up waiting forever to sit in the back. That said, we saw some really great close-up magic!The next show in the room of prestidigitation was pretty terrible. We probably waited 75 minutes to get into a really cheesy show that lasted about 10-15 minutes. Finally, we walked back downstairs and saw a guy doing some decent party tricks, including showing us how he could swallow a bean and have it come out of his tear duct. Next, we saw the MOST AMAZING bar magician! Literally, he is a bartender and magician and does tricks at the bar. Talk about VERY CLOSE UP magic! That was the highlight of my night. Anyway, we also saw one more show in a dungeony type of room down in what seemed to be the most underground part of the castle, and that magician seemed to also be somewhat of a vulgar comedian. He was entertaining, and he did some cool tricks. Overall, I loved it! I hope to be back. Actually visiting makes me want to learn magic.",4 star rating
707,1/29/2018,"Finally was able to go to the elusive magic castle. We had  brunch, which may not be as awesome as dinner, but was not very impressed.  For the price paid, ( entrance free, $25 and valet parking, $15 and then brunch) I definitively expected way more! The magicians were great, but their shows were a mere 15 mins. and it felt like we were being rushed in and out. The buffet brunch was okay, not very flavorful. Definitely not worth $50.! And the final show was really cool, the closing magician was awesome, but again only a less than 30 min show! I do have to say the staff was very nice, our waiter was great, although there was one waiter that was rather loud and a bit rude. So, over all, we were not impressed and expected way more out of this so exclusive club.",3 star rating
708,6/6/2016,"Magician/Tour guide: Rich Freeman Amazing time! We got there at 6pm and didn't leave until shortly after midnight. The best part of the night was that we got a guided tour by Rich! He gave us quite a bit of history on the building, the founders and many of its magicians! Rich showed us the hidden gags and so many other interactive parts of the castle and pointed out a lot of must see magicians and what times we should get in line for shows. (sooooo many things are just hidden in plain sight)All in all, it was a great night and our group was amazed at the things we saw. I suggest that you seek out Rich and ask him for a tour if he isn't performing that night. You will no regret the amazing history lesson and the ties to Disney! and if you're lucky, Rich will show you some of his amazing magic along the tour.",5 star rating

710,3/1/2015,"I've been going to the Magic Castle since December and have nothing but good things to say about it. It's always so much fun to get dressed up and enjoy a night of magic. Make sure to get there early to explore and see everything you can. On busy nights I like to go downstairs by the Hat and Hare bar to see Mike and others in the rooms next door. I've really come to enjoy watching the impromptu magic shows by the magician members. You'll get many more chances to participate in these smaller shows. As a heads up, there's a no photo policy that is enforced in the club. During my first visit I wish I could have taken pictures but realized that I was able to enjoy and focus on the present moment and what was going on around me. Plus it adds a little mystery!I've done the dinner and the brunch and have been really happy with the quality of the food.All in all, going to the Magic Castle is a fantastic experience. If you ever get an invite I would highly recommend going!",5 star rating
711,11/15/2015,"if i could split my reviews for the place and performances i would. The 2 stars that i am giving are only for performances and for people who work there. They are really wonderful and i'm giving them 5 stars for sure. But the place itself, restaurant and the whole system-0 stars. Very commercial and charge for every single thing: mandatory valet parking(13$), mandatory 20$ entrance, mandatory dinner during which one you MUST order entree or they will charge 26$ for a salad which in my case was premade and not fresh. We had a birthday girl and they couldn't even offer a small treat for her, so we ended up paying for ""birthday desert"".  Should i mention included gratuity?I'm glad i checked it out, but wouldn't come back.",2 star rating

It was nice, but I would not be interested in going back.",2 star rating
713,7/22/2013,"A good friend of mine received an invitation and I came along as a guest. We had a party of 6 people.  The way it works is that you must receive an invite from a member of the Magic castle to come for dinner and the magic shows.-Before you come here, make sure you go onto their website!-There is a strict dress code so wear your comfortable suit, you can't take off your jacket unless you cover up your date.-You can only take a picture at the entrance, you cannot take pictures once you are in the castle.-This place is not cheap!-When you enter, show the front desk your police, firefighter, military id and they will waive your 25.00 entrance fee. You can also make a reservation without knowing a member if you have either id.-You have to say ""OPEN SESAME"" and this wall will open up, lol! and you walk into the secret entrance.There are many rooms you can observe magic shows until 1:30am.We had dinner, I ordered the prime rib, diamond cut with vegetables and truffle fries, yum! Watch out for the horseradish, its CONCENTRATED!! I asked for three large scoops and I could barely hang. You take a big scoop and you will start coughing, TRUST ME! lol. After dinner, we received our tickets to the main show. It was PACKED!The main show was a mix of magic tricks and comedy. It was very hilarious!The whole staff were amazing, friendly, and informative.We had a great time!!",4 star rating

Crab legs, roast beef, omlette station, lots of desserts, salmon sashimi and bagels with lox.The kids also had a buffet of fries, chicken strips and a sundae station.Magic is always fun! They even had a show geared for kids.(You can only bring children on the weekends for brunch)",4 star rating
715,9/25/2016,My jam. There really is nowhere else like the Magic Castle in LA and it truly is world famous. The vibe is so classy mysterioso. There are 3 main rooms that vary in intimacy and style. They also have smaller nooks and booths for up-close table magic (my favorite). This is also a really great place to chill and meet new people. It's a pretty exclusive group and the type of place entertainment and finance companies bring big clients when they're in town for business - if that's your thing.  Be forewarned you'll pay for the privilege of spending a night here because on top of the door charge you are required to buy dinner. I'd say you're going to drop $60 per person if you don't drink too much.,5 star rating
716,11/29/2017,"The inside of the building, I am sure has history, but it feels dusty. The brunch selection was disappointing because there are few choices for the price.

717,6/12/2015,"The closest thing to the real Hogwarts you'll ever experienceThe Hogwarts episode of Cribs is the worst. Every room they went in, someone says, ""This is where the magic happens.""

Sit in front at any show and be guaranteed to get picked on.  Did you hear about the perverted magician? He pulled a top hat out of a bunny.",5 star rating

719,1/22/2019,"Well the premise is good, I love the kitsch. But the food is way mediocre and the staff are rude (probably underpaid and bored). We caught an amazing Prestidigitation show at 8pm, but then got turned away from another show an hour before it was even going to begin. We found out that a corporate group had booked the 'rights' to the shows in the whole Castle that evening, and anyone who wasn't part of the party was subject to a very limited experience. Instead of trying to make us feel ok about that, the staff were dismissive and acted like goofy bouncers in some mid-west bar strip, telling us to ""you're not going to get into this show, and please move out the way of the VIPs"". Overall a pretty depressing experience that could have been a lot better with some organization and management on behalf of the admin.",3 star rating
720,10/18/2015,"Been wanting to visit The Magic Castle since I was a little kid. Of course I had expectations, but they were completely blown away! We had dinner reservations for Friday night at 9 pm. I called about a week in advance and they mentioned the rest of Friday night was booked as well as Saturday night. However, I called around 5 pm that Friday to check and see if they had availability earlier in the night, and they did. They were nice enough to change our reservation from 9 pm to 7 pm. We decided to take Uber since we didn't want to deal with traffic and we wanted to have a few drinks. I'm very glad we did, Van Halen was playing at the Hollywood Bowl, and there was mad traffic getting there and getting back. Upon entering, we were greeted by the hostess staff who charged us the entry fee ($30 each person) and provided me a tie (they even tied it for me!). Very nice!We made our way in and were immediately greeted by a cocktail waitress (who was conveniently waiting at the line for one of the magic shows). She took our order and brought us our drinks as we were waiting on line. The room was very cozy, a small auditorium with about 20-30 people. A lot of close up magic with cards and coins - the magician was very smooth. It was a great start to our night!As we left, we passed by the bar again, but didn't get refills. We went downstairs to another cozy magic show. There was about 5-10 people huddled around another close up magician. It was neat being so close to the magic and interacting with them one-on-one! We hung around there for about 15-20 mins, then made our way into the downstairs bar.Unfortunately, the bartender was missing and there was no one there. We sat around for a few mins, then a group of magician members came in with their suitcases. They were talking about who was going to perform (in the next room), apparently there is a queue. I asked if they wanted to warm up on us and they kindly agreed! This was a real treat, we had 2 magicians performing just for us!!Our next stop was dinner, so we made our way upstairs (passing the bar again). They ushered us right and sat us at a window seat. The atmosphere was great, but the tables were very closely spaced (seems to be a problem everywhere in LA). We could clearly hear the conversation of people adjacent to us - fortunately, it was a pretty boring topic, but would have like a little more privacy. I was saddened they didn't have any stouts or porters on tap. So I opted for the old stand-by; Guinness . We also ordered Calamari and Roasted Beets and Burrata Cheese. Both were excellent.For dinner I ordered jumbo shrimp and my girlfriend ordered Colorado Rack of Lamb (marinated in garlic and rosemary with garlic whipped potatoes, seasonal vegetables, and cabernet demi-glace). The shrimp dish was delicious, but the rack of lamb was incredible. Probably one of the top best preparations of lamb I've had. It was super tender, and spiced just right. Overall, really enjoyed the meal and service. After dinner, we made our way to the main theater to watch the ""big show"". There were 50 - 100 people in the theater. We took seats right near the front. Unfortunately, there was a vulgar group of young (and immature) adults sitting right behind us. Definitely drunk. For whatever reason, the cocktail waitress thought it was a good idea to give them more drinks. I was seriously considering leaving, but was excited to see the show. It's clear the goal of the Castle is to have you drink a lot (bars are everywhere) and have a good time. I support that 100%, BUT, the bartenders and cocktail waitresses should cut people off. Further, they should have booted these kids out of the place. They were completely inappropriate.   The good news is, they shut up once the show started. Glad for that, as it was an awesome show. Lot's of comedy, fast moving magic, and creative tricks. As much as I wanted to hand around and get another drink and watch another show, we were getting tired! It was a whirlwind of activity, and we were beat. I scheduled our Uber ride and we bought a few things from the gift shop while we were waiting (which wasn't long at all).All in all, an awesome experience - one of the best I've ever had.",5 star rating
721,9/11/2016,"This place is truly magical.  The shows are amazing.  I've been here several times and I'm entertained every time. We went on a Saturday this past time, so it was a bit harder to get into all the shows.  I definitely recommend going early just to get to see the most shows. The food is mediocre.  I got the scallops and a lobster tail and also the Thai soup.  I've tried the steaks in the past as well.  They are kind of dry in my opinion. The drinks all over the place is great.  They got a really good old fashioned named after Neil Patrick Harris.  Stick around at the bars, because some of them turn into magic shows. I hope I keep getting invited to this place.  I would go ever single time.No pictures to post because they don't allow photography while you are inside.",5 star rating

The food was great, everyone liked what they ordered, and the service was wonderful.Our favorite shows were Chris Capehart and El Ropo. Both acts were funny and entertaining. We also saw Rich Freeman downstairs and he was amazing. It's so impressive to watch card tricks that closely and have no idea how he does it. All in all the Magic Castle was an experience like no other in LA. Worth checking out.",5 star rating
723,2/6/2018,I have been lucky enough to attend the Magic Castle twice. This is one of those places that everyone wants to go to. I mean you have to have an invite which makes it exclusive and you feel special being able to go.  I love the decor and that there is a strict dress code which adds to the ambiance. The food is okay (nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about either) for it being pricey. Drinks are well made but also pricey. The shows and talent throughout the castle are stellar. Everything sets you up to have an amazing time while at the castle.,4 star rating
724,5/22/2013,"There are a few noticable differences between going during the day (only available on Saturday & Sunday) and going during the evening:1) The cover charge:    Sun-Thurs evenings - $20/pp    Fri-Sat evenings - $25/pp    Sat-Sun durning brunch - $15/pp2) Dinner vs Brunch:    Dinner runs from about $50+/pp (appetizer, entree, wine) and Brunch is at a fixed price of around $40/pp and inclues beverage (coffee, tea and mimosa).  In terms of taste and value, brunch wins!3) Dress code:     The attire is more casual (jeans, khakis and sneakers) at brunch but over 50% of the crowd were more on the smart casual dressy side (dress shoes with button down shirts and heels with dresses). Check their website for more details on dress code for the evening attendance.4) Children:    You will only see them on Saturday & Sunday during day time hours.  The front rows are reserved for children and they are usually asked to volunteer to be part of the Magician's acts.  One of the kids had me laughing so hard that my eye make-up had to be touched up afterwards, lol. Having gone once during a weekday evening, once during weekend evening, and most recently for brunch, overall I enjoyed the weekend evening the best!  In terms of entertainment, there were more magic showtimes available and more Magicians at the castle (some of them will perform magic tricks for you)  during Fri-Sat evening. In terms of food, I recommend brunch over dinner. If you go for brunch and make the 12:30pm reservation, you will be able to catch the 1:15pm show at the Parlour and the 2:15pm close-up gallery afterwards.P.S. Magic Castle is celebrating 50th Anniversary this year. They make sure you can't miss it from the time you arrive to every five steps you take inside the Magic Castle. ^_~  They first opened their doors on January 2, 1963. Parking: Valet only.

726,9/13/2015,"This has been my second visit to the Magic Castle and needless to say I was not disappointed.  It is by far one of the most amazing places I have ever been too.  For those not in the know you can only attend by invite from a magician or by staying at the Magic Castle Hotel.  I have done both, for ease I  highly recommend the latter.  Entrance fee is 30 dollars per person plus the cost of dinner and drinks.  There are many venues inside the castle including up close magic that is perforned for small,  intimate groups, bartenders who do magic, working up a large stage performances. You can literally see magic for hours and hours. Tonight there were many people from the industry in attendance, so interesting to hear thier take on magic! Dress is formal,  drss shirts and ties,  cocktail dresses for ladies.  No photography allowed. As far as I know dinner is required.  I ordered the beef in puff pastry with mashed potatoes and vegetables for 39 dollars.   I found the food to be fine,  not fabulous, but seriously I was actually more enthusiastic about seeing all the shows so the food was not as much of priority for me.  A gourmand would probably have a different opinion most likely but hey,  I'm not going to toss stones.  It was fine and service was very good.  One of my favorite things about this place,  besides the gorgeous building,  friendly staff and great magic is Irma's Room. Located on the first floor it is a room allegedly haunted by a ghost and her pet bird (said bird inhabits an empty cage next to Irma's piano) . If you ask Irma nicely she will play your request on the piano. Be sure to leave your tip in the bird cage.  I can't imagine what Irma would do if you didn't leave an appreciation for her musical efforts.  Bottom line if you have the means,  love or like magic and want a really unique and cool experience you will never, ever forget come to Magic Castle. I just left and already I'm planning my next visit, it's that good.",5 star rating

We came during Christmas time, so it was all lit up & super majestic. There was a huge line when we arrived though, so that wasn't really too fun.The food was OKAY, don't come here expecting an amazing meal. I was super excited to see the eggplant Parmesan on the menu, since that is my favorite dish. It was okay.

If you plan it right you can see atleast 2 shows and some of the smaller ones too. We had dinner there at 8pm and we were able to eat, walk around a bit, stop in on some small shows and saw two main shows. We left around 12:30, there was some more shows still on at that time but we were done. The magic is cool and its one of those places that you have to go at least once. I don't see the need to go more unless you really love magic, you're a magician or are friends of the magicians. The card tricks at Randy Gastreich and Rich Cowley show were awesome. Hands down favorite show of the night.The food was reasonable and the service was good. Other than the waiter offering us bread for table (as it was free) and then charging us for it.

729,1/12/2019,"2nd visit to the Magic Castle.My first time was 22 years ago and only SAG members could get in.Very nice looking mansion with some clever ""magical"" touches.The self playing piano was good as was the sliding bookcase entrance to the main house.Magicians were good and the evening was a pleasant memory while not exactly thrilling.Second visit was a little different.Members only, $35 dollar entrance fee,$15 parking.It is a very expensive evening now.Staff,for the most part, were very helpful and friendly.Drinks are very strong and well made.The food was very expensive, also,but very mediocre.Sea Bass,salmon,and filet mignon were marginally okay but at $45 to $49 were overpriced.The small magic acts at random location were very entertaining, especially a magician/bartender.He was very good and his performance and delivery was very entertaining.I knew how most of his tricks worked but he did them so well that I was very  impressed.A ""mentalist"" was also very engaging even though his routine was very routine.The nadir of the evening was the ticketed magic show at 11:30PM. Two magicians alternated their magic tricks.The tricks were laughably simple but the tall magician had a flair for the ridiculous and seemed to know how lame his tricks were, but delivered a fun performance. Almost all his tricks were basic, children's magic set, tricks.Still,not terrible.His little partner, however,lacked the same charm and his delivery was mostly poor.Again,very simple tricks that I,as a 12 year old, had mastered years ago.In his last trick, he requested a hundred dollar bill from a member of the audience.After no one volunteered anything bigger than $20,I gave him a hundred dollars.He had a volunteer write her name and date on the bill and noted that it was torn.I hadn't noticed that earlier but cannot say for certain that it wasn't torn before.I won't go into details of the trick but my bill ended up inside an orange and given back to me soaking wet with Sharpie writing all over it and smelling (tasting, too?)of orange.Very creepy of him to return the bill that he had requested in that condition.I couldn't put it back in my pocket and had to hold it until it dried.This magic show was really bad.Now,it gets interesting.I didn't want to keep that bill so I went to my bank to deposit it this morning.They refused to do so and told me it was counterfeit money.I filled out a form and will be interviewed by the Secret Service in a few weeks if they determine the bill is fraudulent.I seriously doubt that the bill is fake but will certainly have them contact the obnoxious magician who handled that bill if it is.I can only hope!So,in a nutshell, the Magic Castle is still fun but not  $550 ($650,if the bill is phony) worth of fun (for a party of 4 with 6 cocktails).",2 star rating

732,12/6/2015,"I LOOOOOOVE MAGIC....This place makes me feel like a kid all over again.  Be able to watch Magic in such a small room environment and be up close & personal setting watching magician works his magic just amazes me. There is never a dull moment.  This is my third time here over the course of 20 years.  I know... it's been awhile!!! And it's only because it's simply hard to get in.  This is an exclusive private club and the only two ways to get in is:  You must know a member who can give out VIP / guest passes or you can stay at the Magic Castle Hotel which can be costly.  Depending of which nights you stay, a 2 nights minimum is required.  Which in my opinion, it's not worth it if you're not visiting from out of town.  When this opportunity presented to me...It was an honor and I immediately jump on it and decided to use this VIP guest passes to celebrate my boyfriend's early birthday present.  I was on hold for over close to 40 minutes on a Monday night to get someone to help book my reservations.  Yeah, they are extremely busy.  I made this reservations 3 months in advance and still the main room were completely reserved.  I can't say the person who help booked my reservations was too nice.  She was a bit short with me and came off with an attitude.  Just because this is a private club, there should be no need for this stuck up attitude.  Dress Code:  They are extremely STRICT... make sure to read their instructions when they email you the confirmation.  No public parking so you must valet your car.  It costs $13 for guests and $3 for member.  With the guest passes, you still have to pay $30 per person as an entrance fees.  VIP passes, no entrance fees.  Dinner is REQUIRED regardless which guest passes you're holding unless you're a member there yourself.  We got the Houdini private room and it made this experience even better. They offered a photographer so if you are visiting Magic Castle with a bunch of people... hiring this photographer isn't so bad since they don't allow you to take any pictures once you're inside.  The only downsize to it is that you can't view the pictures. You pay $20 and the photographer email you the best picture. However, along with the $20, you can a free returned guest pass back to the magic castle.",5 star rating

This was our first visit to Magic Castle and it lived up to the rave reviews from our friends.Our dinner reservation was for 6 p.m. We planned ahead and gave our order to our friends. It's important to get there on time because the next dinner seating is at 8 p.m. and everybody has to clear out. The staff will pack up your food if you don't finish. We were pretty late so we had to eat our food quickly. The filet mignon was very good, as was the rest of our meal. We had tickets for the 8 p.m. magic show and it was very entertaining and impressive. We saw a very creative and humorous female juggler.

I ordered the scallop tagliatelle, It was really disappointed. I thought it would be the jumbo scallops, but instead it was the really tiny ones. For the same price, you're better off ordering one of the meat dishes. Other than the disappointing dinner, the magic shows were really entertaining. I suggest getting to the shows early to wait otherwise it gets full quickly. Overall, my experience was great and I'll definitely be coming back.",4 star rating
736,6/30/2017,"Addendum: In response to the ""points"" made by Jennifer of The Magic Castle:1) She says they have no Middle Eastern floor manager yet she also states that she interviewed the employees involved in the incidents. If she truly did so, it would make sense she would then state what ethnicity the olive skinned doorkeeper was since apparently I was wrong. Since she didn't, then either she didn't interview all the employees involved and lied about this or she's just spouting non-pertinent corporate b.s. rather than responding to the review.2) She states they have a diverse staff despite her stating that they apparently don't have a Middle Eastern floor manager, I didn't see any Asians serving in any station, and there was a very large predominance of Caucasians. If their employment roster for management is the same ratio as ethnicities in Los Angeles, I'd be flabbergasted.3) Jennifer's point is ridiculous when she states that only 1 person can leave the line...then she agrees that the group ahead of us breached this (with 3 people leaving!) but was allowed to enter without any hassle while my group was blocked (with 2 people leaving). Her facts completely align with the doorkeeper being malicious which was our point. I don't think she understands what an honor system is...as it was just the doorkeeper throwing his mean ass power around, there was no honor to it at all.4) I was wearing a tailored $700 jacket. In her words, she agrees I met the dress code. It was not a ""casual jacket."" Also, Jennifer ignored the fact the front desk told me I could just check my jacket and not wear one at all.5) My review didn't say the manager was clarifying the two rooms. It stated he went on a rant and was snooty. I would not have been offended if he said ""I know you asked if this was the Palace of Prestidigitation. We have a Palace of Mystery & we have a Parlour of Prestidigitation. This is indeed the Parlour of Prestidigitation. The Palace of Mystery is further down the hall."" That would be clarifying! What he did was a ridiculous snooty rant. Jennifer is showing questionable managerial skills in telling her staff they're doing well and to ignore what the customer is saying. Really reminds me of the United CEO praising his staff after the doctor was forcibly removed from his flight (if future generations forget what happened telegraph.co.uk/news/201…) .6) No tickets were provided to us for the show the server said had plenty of space for us. Our server said to simply that we definitely had time to eat dessert and to just go there as there was plenty of space. We heard nothing over the PA. Which...goes exactly with Jennifer finally stating that the show I was talking about didn't accept tickets! What kind of waste of time b.s. is Jennifer spouting?!!? Then Jennifer says ""nobody can estimate how fast the non-ticketed show will fill up"" which is EXACTLY what I told the server when I told her I was favoring not eating dessert to make sure we caught the show, only to be reassured repeatedly otherwise. Jennifer is somehow agreeing with me about the facts...but  magically (pun intended) saying her staff was right despite the facts show they were wrong.TL;DR Jennifer is full of hot air. Pretty much she agrees with half the points I made, and dodges the other points. Yet somehow, she says Magic Castle was in the right and I was somehow wrong. Great manager. I'm sure her staff learn a lot from her.",1 star rating
737,3/31/2016,"We had such a magical and amazing time at the Magic Castle! I was lucky enough to get an invite to the Magic Castle from a friend. My cousins from New Zealand were in town, so I had a bucket list of LA's most amazing and unique activities and this is definitely at the top of the list. We went on a Thursday night, and it was a little quiet earlier in the night when we got there at 6 or 7 but by 8:30 pm it was hopping just like a Friday or Saturday night. The most magical part about the Magic Castle is that it's real- it really is a club for magicians! The magicians at green tables are there to volunteer their time and try their latest tricks for guests. We hapilly wandered through the labyrinthian Victorian Mansion finding random Magicians doing incredible card tricks at tables, behind the bar, in small private rooms, or in the hallways. Fun art / magic mirrors / signed photographs / awards to ogle and we met really interested people.We had dinner, as you must if you aren't a member, and it was delicious! I had the crab soup and tuna tartare, and my cousins had the steak and sushi. So delicious!You also get one large show in a large auditorium as part of your night. Was such a great show! But the best part of the magical castle is wandering around, meeting members, and coming across amazing/surprising things! At the top of my list of ""LA's best!""",5 star rating
738,3/7/2014,"After years of wanting to go to The Magic Castle, I finally took action to seek out a member who could help get us in. The bf and I were celebrating our anniversary and I wanted to surprise him with something different. The whole experience was incredibly cool but since everyone is forced to eat at the restaurant, I had to take a star off for the food.The highlight of the evening was the closeup performer, Garrett Thomas. I lined up early to make sure we'd get in and we sat down right in front of him. This guy totally blew my mind. He did things with Rubik's cubes and coins that I've never seen before. Completely amazing! The ""main"" show seemed like a low-budget version of a Vegas show though so I'd recommend skipping on that.The ""Castle"" itself had lots of areas that warranted discovery.  In addition to the shows listed on the schedule, there were cool impromptu magic shows around every corner. It was a weeknight so we left around 10 but I'm very excited to come back and see more magic.",4 star rating
739,4/11/2013,"I never even heard of the Magic Castle till it was all over the news, that it caught on fire.  After that I said to myself I must go. 2 years later I find myself on a smoke break at work.  where I met my smoking buddy Magic Mike.  I would make him show me magic tricks and then one day i asked him about the magic castle and so he got me a pass.  Yeah for smoking!  Magic Mike Hooked it up with the Magic Castle.  With my ENTJ personality.  I read some Yelp reviews and decided that we must go early, in order to soak everything in.  I am from the OC, I made all my friends leave their house at 330 so we can be there by the time it open up at 5 pm. So we got there at 5, walked around for a bit while we wait for our 6 pm dinner reservation.  I got myself a jack and coke which cost like 11 bucks.  I know I tell people I don't drink, but this is my once a year drink. My buddy bought my drink anyways.. It was kinda warm  inside the MC my friend took off his jacket and they made him put it back on.  Apparently you can only take it off when you're at dinner.  So dinner time...  I ordered the Houdini cut prime ribs medium rare and added a lobster tail for 15 bucks.  I don't know why people complained that the food sucked, I liked mine.  Everyone liked their food except for my friend that got pasta.  I also got to try a few appetizer.  my entire table left for a bit while we waited for our food.  One of my friend and I decided to  help ourselves to everyone's appetizer.  I had the crab cakes, calamari and garlic bread.  I didn't like the complimentary bread.  It was like a cinnamon roll, but without the frosting.  Later in the bar area my friend hustle some magician into buying us dessert so we ended up with cheese cake with blueberries and a chocolate lava cake.  Yeah... I'm not a big dessert person, too sweet for me.  We got got her at 5 pm and manage to squeeze into 4 shows.  Since we had dinner we were given tickets so was able to view the main show without the wait.  Then I lost half of my group and ended up in the Basement with no phone signal and found myself at a bar with another magic show going on.  I like that one because it felt more intimate and the magician try to include everyone.  The ghost piano player was pretty neat. However, she was temperamental and only wanted to play one request per person.    When I asked for a 2nd song she just hit a really low key as if she was saying no.  Anyway..... Thanks to our new magician friends, we will be back soon. One day for brunch and another day for the seance.",5 star rating
740,6/24/2013,"A really fun place to spend the evening! Getting all dressed up and coming here, you can't help but feel like a baller (even if you're just a poor starving grad student like me).Very classy and vintage ambiance inside. The schedule is structured such that you can choose between various shows before and after dinner. I think the close up magic shows were just ok the night I went, but still entertaining. Dinner is nice, but nothing extraordinary (but then again it's not the reason why you go). I'd recommend the lamb or filet.Overall, the night can get pretty expensive ($25 door charge, plus valet, plus dinner, and drinks if you want). Still, I think it's something worth experiencing if you have an invite or know someone that does!",3 star rating
741,2/24/2018,This is one amazing place to have dinner and catch a show at. Their steaks and seafood are good. The magical entertainment is some of the best in the United States. They always have nice shows and they change up the magicians every couple months,5 star rating
742,5/10/2015,"I wanted to give this place an annoyed and/or butthurt 2 star review but I don't know if that's really fair because I could've done a bit more research on where i'm going.So my gf got some tickets from a coworker and we booked months in advance.We received our confirmation emails for this dinner that said to wear coat, tie, dress pants so the second I get out of the car at the valet, the dude at the front pulls me over and says my pants are too casual. Uh what? I'm wearing khaki colored slacks. They pull me to the side and say if I don't have any other pants they might be able to find me another pair of pants. Again, what? I just drove there for an hour and a half while battling LA traffic and now I've gotta go put on a pair of loaner gym shorts. Or go home. Nice. So 20 minutes later I get my size-too-big pair of suit pant loaners and go put them on in the bathroom stall. These pants were cut 25 years ago to look like wind sails but they're dark and for a suit  and I have a belt to keep them in place ...so success? At the same time, another lady is walking out of the bathroom holding a pair of pants. I don't look her in the eyes but we communicate telepathically and continue on our walk of shame back to the girl who gave us the pantalones. It would be nice if the email I got which mentioned not wearing capri pants (nice pants bro, do you even yoga), skorts (not making this up) and t shirts (not just affliction) to dinner also mentioned not wearing beige french vanilla slacks.So that was the start of my night. To save yourself the trouble, just wear a dark business suit and be done with it. The dinner was fine. Our waitress was awesome. I ordered the beef wellington which looked nothing like the beef wellington I ordered at the Gordon Ramsey restaurant before (he's the only reason I know what this dish is), but it actually tasted pretty good. Our lava cake dessert didn't have any molten lava inside when I cut into it and there was no ice cream on the plate which is a bit of a jip but its fine.So we went off to the show. And it was good. Jonathan Pendragon did not disappoint and the rest of his team were great too. Hey there's even an adorable dog involved. At 45 minutes it felt short but it was a lot of fun. Many people in the audience seemed to be regulars which  definitely gives this a club feel.The seating in the back makes it a little hard to see but luckily we were somewhere towards the middle. Our party had to split up and some people got stuck in the back. After that we walked around to watch some other magicians but it would be nice if there was some kind of a map to the place b/c its hard to know what/how much you're missing.In conclusion, its certainly an unusual experience and I should have spent more than 2 minutes researching where I'm going. Aside from that, I think we all had a good time so if you like magic, this should be on your list of places to visit. Unfortunately all I could think of towards the end of the night was getting out and putting on my own pants. If it wasn't for that, I would've liked to stay there longer to explore.",3 star rating
743,11/16/2013,The magic shows had their moments. It was Veteran's week and all the magicians were part of the armed forces at some point and time. The dinner was decent but the price was predictably inflated. The magicians were extremely polite and my other friends got a private tour of the entire castle--apparently sprinkled throughout the castle there were different buttons and statues you could move and press to open secret passageways. Minus one star because they need to work on their cashier girls--one dark haired girl gave us attitude and charged our cards incorrectly. She was confused and had too much attitude. Shady queens need not apply when we are paying good money to have a good time.,4 star rating
744,9/14/2018,"The bouncer who was at the door was very discriminatory towards me based on my address. He asked me if my designer bag was really mine, and then went on to say that he needed to check my bag because of where I am from. He then went on to ask me if I had certain weapons in my possession using some sort of slang that I had never heard of.  After I told him that the address was my moms house he went on to insult her and say that I should ask her to explain the slang that he was using because ""she would know"". I am very disappointed in the service here, I am a young, educated, and attractive female and should not have experienced such harassment from an older man especially in front of my date. This was rude, unprofessional and inappropriate from a group that claims to be so classy. Such a shame.",1 star rating
745,3/3/2016,"This is absolutely THE MOST FAMOUS Magic venue in the whole world!! It has so much history, you can go there several times and still never hear all the stories behind the decor and all the performing rooms and specialty rooms. The food is FANTASTIC! The service is unparalleled. The schedules of the shows make it imperative that the food is served in time for the customers to be able to make it to scheduled shows. The strict dress code adds to the elegant atmosphere. People are on better behavior when they're dressed to the hilt and everybody looks GREAT! There are five bars, six scheduled show areas with early and late performer shifts, several specialty rooms and informal show areas where magicians can perform even if they are not on the schedule. Everybody is laughing or in awe...its just the most upbeat positive experience that you can imagine. Highly, highly recommended!!",5 star rating
746,7/28/2013,"My family and I went to the Magic Castle to celebrate my birthday recently. I had never been there before and didn't know what to expect. I only knew that it was exclusive and that they had a dress code. The ambiance was definitely cool and it felt as if you had traveled back in time or something, but then you were greeted by the rude hostesses. They were short with us, didn't even look up from their computer screens and were very condescending. Our family friend had given us a guest pass to enter and even though we had a printed out confirmation e-mail saying that we were allowed to go in at our appointed time, the hostesses almost did not let us in. If it wasn't for my sister showing them that we had received our guest pass on her phone, then my birthday celebration would have been ruined. My family and I were also dressed up very fancy (evening gown wear/coats and ties), but there were so many people that were allowed in who were not up to par on the strict dress code that they ""supposedly enforce"" there. Tourists were coming in with sandals, plaid shirts and one girl even had on fishnet stockings underneath her cut up jean shorts. We weren't allowed to take any pictures AT ALL except for inside the lobby and outside, of course. I must admit, the food was pretty good and our waiter was funny, but we felt as if we were rushed and cattled through our meal before they had to start cleaning up the area to make way for the next crowd of people. The magic show was fun, but way too short- it only lasted about twenty minutes. The side card shows were amusing and there were lots of different pictures to look at. For the money that people pay to get in, the food is the only thing that's worth it.",3 star rating
747,5/31/2015,"I love the entertainment value of the magic castle. It's one of a kind, full of surprises, gives a new perspective to reality, and is loads of fun. It's nice to dress up and experience. I've been twice and my first visit was far better than my recent one.I don't like giving harsh criticisms, but I do feel like their menu has room for growth. I don't agree with ""vegetarians go nuts for this spot"", it's really misleading. Since you're forced to buy an expensive entree as a part of the ticket, there's only a limited selection. If you're vegetarian, you have one pasta option, if you're vegan, you have one option that isn't even on the menu because it rotates weekly. The day that I was there (Tuesday), they had a tofu curry. Recall that you don't get a choice, you have to order an entree or they charge you anyway, so if you don't happen to like this, too bad. I enjoyed the kale strawberry salad as an appetizer and in retrospect wish I could have just had a larger version for an entree.The tofu curry, with respect has room for improvement. To say it bluntly, it was the worst curry I've ever had and I'm a Thai food enthusiast. I had to ask for more sauce because it was dry and lack luster. By the time I got more sauce (also lacking flavor) my meal was cold. I was going to just suck it up, finish my meal without saying anything, but the server asked my ""honest opinion"" and I gave it. Luckily, another server/hostess who was also vegan understood and agreed with me and removed it from my bill. She was very pleasant, understanding, and explained they're still working on the menu and some nights are better than others. My feelings are, if I'm paying $19 (minimum) for a dinner, it better have a happy ending. Because of all the delays and confusion, my table didn't even get to have time for coffee or dessert, and I was hungry for the rest of the evening. I remember the first time I went here, dinner was more pleasant and the server was more warm and inviting. Our server this time had s really sarcastic and discomforting since of humor, the kind of humor that makes your stomach turn, like when you watch an actor drop his line on stage. But he was very comfortable expressing that this was his last week working there so his focus was askew accordingly. I don't feel this is a common experience here, and the dinner is only a percentage of the experience. Also if you're a carnivore, you have much more of a selection. But I feel that: 1: it's 2015, 2: it's LA, 3:vegans are not uncommon, 4: if you're forcing patrons to buy an entree as a part of the experience, don't make it feel like you're cursing the herbivores. I'd go back, just to have a better experience to reflect on, but I was rather disappointed this time. Thank goodness for hilarious magicians and entertainers that take your mind to magical places.",3 star rating
748,1/22/2016,"It was good. Why is it not a 5? It just didn't blow my mind. I was expecting some David Copperfield, Cris Angel type stuff. Perhaps my expectations were unreasonably high and I certainly don't want to take anything away from the otherwise excellent magicians that I saw that night. That said, it was definitely a great experience. Food came out quickly (I assume they were made ahead of time in expectation of future orders as the 3 plates that my party of 3 ordered came out in like 7 minutes), they had a shorter magic show prior the main event that allowed a good build up and I was able to watch a couple parlor tricks that were also fun. Other stuff to add--$13 for valet paid for at the door along with the weekday cover charge for non members  (I had an invite from a member) and entree cost was about $40 per person. Add tip to valet and to server and it rounds out to roughly about...70-90 per person. This was for a Tuesday evening dinner and show mind you. I don't know what the prices are for a show. Go.

Talk about learning anxiety and intimidation inside these walls! Magicians from all over the world fly in to show you something magical in one of their numerous stages/rooms from close up magic to the big time stage theatre! They rotate them weekly!  After taking Magic I, I got hooked! I am now in Magic IV and these classes are still blowing my mind! I completely appreciate the magical arts and the amounts of practice and concentration these guys do for their craft! So, if you haven't come here yet, contact me and let's try to get you in to see a weekend brunch performance....or better yet, sign up for a class!

We were packed in the brunch area like a can of sardines.  The parents wanting to outdo their friends birthday parties did their child's birthday at the magic castle ruining the day for other people.

The squid ink pasta with crab, shrimp and scallops was one of the worst plates of food I've ever eaten at a restaurant...and it was $47. The shrimp cocktail for $18 was average.  They have a captive audience that is required to buy dinner at this place...why not make it decent or at least edible??

752,9/18/2009,"This review is based solely on entertainment, my friends and I did not dine here at the Magic Castle. The magicians knew how to wow, amaze, and confuse me the whole night! I was bummed that we couldn't get to see the most popular magician that night, whoops I forgot his name. The wait was full for the next two shows, it was sort of a downer at the moment. However we were able to get our own private show by a magician who was hanging out at the castle. After his little show he told us that if we couldn't get into the popular show, he knew another magician around the castle that could perform for us too.Don't forget to pay Irma, the piano-playing ghost, a visit. Tip her birdie and she will play the song you request. I don't think she likes top 40's music though, she refused to play ""I Kissed a Girl"" by Katy Perry and Low by Flo Rida. Unfortunately we didn't get to that point. It was a Sunday night and it was time to stop acting like children and start being grown-ups again. If I get invited back here again (and you have to be invited, you can't just show up), I'd definitely say yes. It's always nice to get dolled up =)Valet parking is $8 for non-members.",5 star rating

The valet was great! A bouncer opened my door and opened back passenger door to get my coat and hold it open for me. I felt like a VIP. Jen took pics of me on the red carpet. It's fun to feel like a celeb one time, at least.It was crowded at maître d stand.  Dinner and service was excellent, as I am a big fan of prime rib. Jen had the filet and wedge salad. They sang Happy Birthday to me and brought chocolate cake and ice cream. The show was pretty good, but kinda corny.

Magic Castle should be something you try at least once in your life.  Things kinda add up by the end of the night, but it's something different from your usual night out.  I LOVEEEE magic so I definitely enjoyed all the different shows.  Tips/comments:-Parking: Valet only $13-$30 entrance fee -Dress code is enforced.  Stay classy :) -Dinner: Food is not that great, but not horrible.  I had their Sea Bass and their chipotle mac and cheese.  Sea bass was okay, but their mac and cheese was horrible.  SOOO bland! -Having dinner there gets you a ticket to their main show at a scheduled time.  I heard that you can still watch the main show without having dinner there, but would probably have to wait ? -Walk around and explore! Lots of rooms and other bars around.  They also give tours -No photography whatsoever.  We were warned before entering that ""no selfies, bathroom pics, or food porn"" were allowed haha-If you buy a picture that their photographer takes inside, you can get a guest pass to come back and you can bring back up to 7 ppl (total party of 8)--  $20",4 star rating
755,6/21/2013,"My boyfriend and I braved the traffic to go to Magic Castle on a Tuesday night. The mansion is located on top a small hill, so it's not hard to find.Our group had dinner reservations at 8:00pm. My boyfriend ordered the Prime Rib and I ordered the Pan-Seared Atlantic Salmon. He liked his steak, which came with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The salmon came with rice and vegetables, so I swapped my plain rice with his mashed potatoes. The salmon was disappointing--it wasn't flaky enough and there was no seasoning at all. Some people in our group ordered appetizers, but we just went for the free bread (which was tasty). No one ordered dessert, but there wouldn't have been time for it anyway. We were the last group to leave the dining room and were almost late to the show.We saw a total of three shows. The main show was with a celebrity magician (although I forget his name) and lasted about half an hour. Another show was a close-up show, so the room didn't fit many people (only half our group ended up going in). All the shows and tricks were very entertaining. We also occasionally saw magicians performing card tricks outside in the main area near the bar.There seems to be a pretty strict dress code. All the guys were in suits and the girls in dresses.Parking is valet only for $10.I had a fun time at Magic Castle, and would love to go back if I can sit out on the dinner portion.

Yes, you need to come here prepared to spend money. No, this is not a place to get sloshed. It's a place to dress up nicely and pretend your from a different era. I gave this place 4 stars because all our steaks came out over cooked and I believe a place that charges $40-70 a dinner should know how to cook their meat. Also, the wine did not pair well with the food and we had three different kinds on the table. Another big disappointment for a foodie. Everything was still delicious and the Pistachio Creme Brûlée was pure redemption. Regardless of the dining, this place was obviously not about the food.

760,2/18/2015,"Never in my life I was humiliated like this.First let me say that I respect dress codes and followed exactly what was on the invitation I got.We parked at the valet and got out of the car, my friend helped me to put on the tie, I didn't have time to wear it because I was running late as for work.Then I noticed some whispering between two guys in front, then one of them walked toward us stops, go back to whisper the other guy then finally walk toward us.We get approached by a very rude security guy (doorman) who told me that my pants are not allowed here, when I asked why he asked me if I have back pockets and I said yes, I had to lift my jacket to show it to him otherwise no one would never know, then he said you see it's casual and not elegant enough.He tried to send me back home or to a local clothing shop at 8:15PM to get new pants, really??This felt like I am being picked for other reasons and I don't think it was because of my clothes... My pants are dress pants!, I wear them to many events, its not jeans like, all black nothing about it say not elegant or cheap (the way he made me feel).On top of all that, the gentleman ""nicely"" told me that if we don't get in its like a late cancelation or no show, therefore my friend who made the reservation will be charged for 2 people.How low an ""high end"" place can go?First you humiliate a person who just wanted to have good time with friends, and give you his hard earned money for the night by making up BS about his pants (seriously he had to get so close to me and touch my pants and really look for something to be wrong), then you ""nicely"" give him ultimatum to get=buy new pants (Reminding you 8:15PM) or else your friend will be charged for no show, which clearly thats not the case.This place is disgrace! I don't care who you think you are, there was nothing legit about the way you treated me or handled the situation.I know most people will ignore this incident and focus on the show, but first thing first, you have no respect to people, its a place that act in a very shady way, and I hope one day you'll understand that being respectful is much more important to your success than pick on someone with back pockets.I was reading other bad reviews about the way the management handled customers, so even though you read many good reviews, do yourself a favor and go watch magic shows and much more worthy dinner in places that wont treat you like garbage.",1 star rating

My last visit, dinner wasn't mandatory (thank you, again).If you didn't know already, this spot is 21+ and valet only. Drinks are well-crafted and hey, you're at a castle, you shouldn't have to park your own car, right?There are several rooms each with their own magical act. I suggest grabbing a program so you can see when the shows start. Try to get there early to ensure that you get a seat, but bring a drink with you so you're entertained.Lastly, be a good sport and volunteer to be an assistant! That's always fun and you get to go home with souvenirs (mostly cards with your name on it and other things you ""ooh'd and aah'd"" about during the act)!",4 star rating
762,4/15/2013,"I'm gonna say it...I thought it was just ok. Nothing spectacular about it at all. Maybe I came in expecting too much and that's why I wasn't blown away? We saw 4 different shows and by then I was over the rope and cards tricks. Also be sure to dress up as you'll be told you're not dressed appropriately at the door. Save the embarrassment.This place looks like they haven't invested a dime since the 80's. I honestly think the hype behind it is the ""members only"" vibe which makes it feel exclusive.",3 star rating
763,2/26/2015,"""The World Famous Magic Castle"" is also how Las Vegas describes its hotels, casinos, show, etc.... funny enough, after the Larson Brothers took over this establishment, a tacky ""Vegas-style"" attraction is exactly what the Magic Castle turned into. FYI: This review is my experience based on service, which IS NOT a comment on the performers or magic acts. For some reason, its hard to get into this club and its hyped up to seem like some incredible secret society. It's $20 for cover, $13 to valet, and to top it all off, you are REQUIRED to eat at the restaurant. Those policies wouldn't bother me at all.....if it was worth it. First, the positives: The menu had a great selection. The coconut crab bisque was tasty and spicy, the chili wasn't too salty with nice chunks of Filet Mignon, and the Manhattan I ordered was prepared very nicely. However, no Cobb Salad is worth $26. My friend told me the Filet Mignon was above average, however, the green bean and mashed potato sides left much to be desired. The waitress was slow and the Mexican busboys are incredibly rude. I asked where one of the shows was, he snapped back at me, and ripped the brochure out of my hands. The crowd here is incredibly frightening. I've never been in a room with the most aggressive crusty white people (an Australian blonde told me she was allergic to my coat, yet nothing happened when she sat next to me for 40 minutes, and a brunette fought my friend for a playing card that was thrown out into the crowd during a show) This place is just overrated. I couldn't get out of there sooner.",1 star rating

765,2/19/2016,"Wow! What an incredible experience. My boyfriend and I were invited to the magic castle by some of our close friends. We were thrilled to get the invite because we had been DYING to go for some time now. Needless to say, my expectations were high. We arrived just before 8PM which is when our dinner reservations were. If you are not a member of the Magic Castle, you have to order dinner and you have to spend a certain amount of money. Dinner is expensive so prepare yourself for that. None of the entrees really jumped out at me so I ordered my own assortment of appetizers: I ordered the wedge salad to start with and that was delicious; I asked for extra blue cheese on it because I'm obsessed with it and I was given a plentiful amount. Then I ordered the side of crab Mac and cheese, which was good but really small. I expected it to be a lot bigger for it being $14 and it didn't have a whole lot of crab in it. I also ordered the calamari too which was really tasty. My boyfriend ordered the Sea Bass, which I stole a taste of and loved. Our server, Carissa, was charming and charismatic and got all of our orders perfect. She took great care of us. Now onto the best part: the magic! We had tickets to a main show in a theater. There were 3 different acts. The first 2 were cool but the third one absolutely blew my mind. I'm still trying to figure out how the magician did the things that he did. I won't give it away though. Make sure you arrive early so you can get good seats.  There are also a lot of little side shows which you should definitely check out and those go on at different times through the night. I wish we had gotten there earlier but due to it being a Thursday and having work plus LA traffic, were unable to get there until almost our 8PM reservation time. Next time we are going to get there much earlier so we can see more magic. On top of a great dinner and being able to watch outstanding magic, the decor and the vibe of the magic castle is awesome. It's super old school in every aspect from the old pictures on the walls to the wooden staircase, which I absolutely loved. It's also an awesome excuse to get super dressed up. Guests are expected to dress very nicely. Gentlemen are expected to wear a tie. Ladies, this is your chance to get glamorous. I LOVE dressing up, so going to a place that requires it, is right up my alley. The only thing that I didn't like was that we can't take any pictures inside!! You can outside before you go in but none inside which made me sad because I'm a huge picture person. Overall, it is an amazing experience. It is expensive though, but in my opinion, completely worth it. It's a very exclusive place and also very special. I'm so happy that I was able to go. If you get invited, take advantage of that; you won't regret it. We even saw Drake Bell from Drake & Josh and got to hang out with him! I loved that show growing up so that was the cherry on top of a terrific night.",5 star rating
766,7/26/2015,"I FINALLY got an invite to Magic Castle via one of my buddies.Valet is $13. Entrance is $30 per person.There are bars, it seems, at every corner of the castle. The small comedy shows are really cool, but keep in mind that the shows are very live. Some magicians made some mistakes, but it didn't take away from the awesome magic they were displaying. Their hands move incredibly fast, so keep your eyes on their hands!I was selected to participate in some of the acts, which makes the experience that much better. If you get the chance, raise your hand!The food was actually DELICIOUS! I read some of the reviews, and some other Yelpers were hating on the food. I'm not sure, but my friends and I LOVED the food. They give awesome portions so getting full should be no worry.I ordered the Prime Rib (18 oz), and it was HUGE. I had to give some away because I couldn't handle it. It comes with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, vegetables, and an au jus sauce that you can't ignore. I highly recommend the prime rib. Tender, juicy, and PACKED with FLAVA! I also tried the short rib, filet mignon, and lobster tail; ALL were good, so you can't really go wrong.The main show had me at the edge of my seat. When the show was over, I was like ""WHAT?? ALREADY??"" The quickest 45 minutes ever. So fun and entertaining. The best show all night!",5 star rating
767,6/7/2013,"Truly, truly MAGICAL!! ahh! I think half the fun is asking around and trying to get a ticket in. You'd be surprised how many of your friends are actually members or know a magician! Then you have to dress up (men: suits, women: dresses or pantsuits) and I definitely think I couldve had more fun with this, there were ladies in pretty period pieces and accessories adorning their hair! (Next time Eileen, next time) The food was surprisingly better than I expected it to be, albeit the high prices. Our server suggested the 4 cheese garlic bread, which was not great, too heavy. I would skip it. Their complimentary bread basket was so much better (soft and a little sweet, almost like sweet hawaiian bread). We also got a fish dish and a beef dish...i honestly can't even remember exactly what it was bc i was so excited to just be there but it was actually pretty good (better than i thought itd be). Service was excellent! one funny story: as i was signing the check, i was telling my friends how i wanted to steal the magic castle pen (only joking of course! but i do have a thing for good pens, and this one had ""magic castle"" written on it and was thin and pretty and wrote so well!). so on my way out, one of the servers/managers hands me a pen, with a cute little wink! so sweet!!!ok anyways,ON TO THE MAGIC!!its so much fun to explore the castle and come across improv personal sessions with different magicians. there were numerous rooms where my friends and i sat right across from a magician and saw magic from right across the small table!! so intimate and so fun! and i definitely suggest going to the downstairs bar, where the bartender will mix you your drink, and then proceed to show you flashy magic shows from right across the bar, right in front of you. Our sit-down magic show was amazing. mind blowing. crazy. intimate. funny. sweet. that is all i will say. (my fave magician of the night: J Neal, who opened the show. loved him!) the castle is smaller and so much more intimate than i thought itd be, and i loved it. it was so much fun. a great night.",5 star rating

769,5/13/2017,"The people who run this place are nothing short of a disaster; the biggest, most unprofessional *jerks* in any public venue I have ever seen or dealt with...while ironically, the magicians, food & ambiance are nothing short of superb. So, beware!Having personally hosted more than 500+ people at 'The Castle', my last two final visits have found their management team to be the rudest, most unhelpful, truly mean people, that I have ever dealt with. And I've hosted many events in many, many places. From just one of those incidents:--Their events team illegally [in my mind fraudulently] triple-charged my Credit card, for  charges already paid to them. This caused my card to be declined obviously, and the Castle to them falsely claim that my bill 'was still due to be paid.' A total lie, by totally dense people, as by now I'd paid them more than $24,000 for a $7,000 bill. Amazing.--When I pointed this out to them, days later? No apology, no admission of error, nothing. --When I called, then wrote the executive running the Castle to complain? No apology, no answer, no admission of error, nothing. How can this guy be in charge of a place like this? So, I let a while pass before going back again, thinking they might get competent, better people in there. Wrong. Way wrong - what a big mistake.Please take your money elsewhere folks, until this storied, beloved place gets proper, professional people running the place, unlike the dirtbags running it for the last 5+ years. Very, very sad.",1 star rating
770,3/5/2014,"Went here with a group of 8 friends on a Saturday night to check out what The Magic Castle had to offer.Our dinner reservation wasn't until 9:30pm, so we pulled up to the bar and got a drink and started heading around to view different magic shows.I don't remember any magicians names specifically, but all of the magicians we saw were talented and pretty entertaining, except for maybe the last magician of the night (who also does the last show of the night).This place is definitely an old Hollywood staple that is worth checking out at least once just to experience the quirkiness and history of the building and the magic inside.For the meal, our food was actually pretty tasty. I did not know what to expect, but I ordered the chicken and enjoyed it. It was decently sized and I left very satisfied, even after a good amount of drinks.Overall, I really like having our meal later on because it provided a break from all the magic. The prices for the place are a bit expensive but worth it for a one-time opportunity.",4 star rating
771,2/1/2017,"I've been to the Magic Castle twice, once a year and a half ago, and the most recent time was a month and a half ago, for my company's Christmas party. I was SO excited to come back because I had a really good time the first time I came, so I KNEW that it was going to be an awesome night!As you may have already known, you need some kind of connection to get into the Magic Castle, whether you know a magician performing that night, or know someone who's a member, or whatever the case may be. I was lucky enough to be able to have those kinds of connections, not once, but twice!! Depending on the connection, your pass may get you in completely free without the purchase of a meal, or you have to pay for a meal in order to get in (along with paying $30/person admission, 6 people max). The pass I got the first time I went was to pay for the meal, which was a bit overpriced for the food that you get ($30+ for an entree), but I'll discuss that later.So when you drive up to the Castle, you're going to come across some Valet people. They open the car doors for you to get out, and then give you a ticket before driving off with your car. You then can either take pictures outside before going in with their backdrop (since you can't take pictures at all after you get in past the cashier area), or stand in line for ID checks and then go inside. Sadly, my most recent visit was on a rainy day so I wasn't able to take pictures with the Christmas-y backdrop. So once we got inside, we stood in line to pay for Valet, which was $13/car (so carpool if you can!!).After that, we said a secret word and the door magically opened up for us to enjoy the night!!Dinner reservations for my most recent visit was at 6pm, and because of the rain and L.A. weekday traffic, we got there at around 6pm. I wanted to get there when doors opened at 5pm so that we could enjoy some shows before dinner, but we didn't have that chance. Since we got there right in time for dinner, we went up to where our tables were. Dinner was served when most people got there, which was awhile.The first time I went, I got the braised beef short-ribs, and that was pretty messy to eat, especially in your really nice clothes! So this time around, I learned my lesson and ordered the Citrus Rosemary Chicken instead. I really liked the short-ribs from the first time, but it was just too messy to eat. It looked like they've made it easier this time around because some of my coworkers got the short-ribs, and it did not look like what I had the year before. The chicken? I didn't really like it at all. It was a bit dry, my piece at least, but I've heard that there were actually more drier pieces around. So I'd definitely pass on the chicken next time I go there! The portion size both of the times were on the small side. The first time around, I know that I was still pretty hungry after eating my meal. This time, I was ok, but I wasn't super hungry to begin with. A lot of my coworkers mentioned how they didn't really like their dinner, and I wasn't surprised, since they're not really known for their food, but more of, for the shows.We got dessert this time around, and I got a taste of the New York Cheesecake as well as the Chocolate Decadence Cake. I preferred the cheesecake more. The chocolate cake was ok, nothing special about it. Portion size for desserts were pretty good.When you have dinner reservations, you get a ticket into a show, which is good because the shows are all first-come-first-served, so you have to stand in line and wait for them to open the doors. The first time I went, we got tickets for the big show. I actually thought that was what we were going to get this time around, too, but we ended up getting tickets into a more intimate show, which fits about 20-25 people in a room.So after dinner, we went to that show, and then waited in some lines for other shows throughout the night. All of the shows were A-MAZING!I have to say, I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY enjoyed the Magic Castle the last time I went! Why? Because ALL of the magicians were SOOO good!! I thought I had a great time the first time I went, but WOW. I was definitely blown away and left EXTREMELY happy!!All in all, if you EVER get the chance to go to the Magic Castle, GO!!!! You'll definitely have a really good time!!! I can't wait to go back, whenever that may be!!!TIP: If it's your birthday, you can ask for a birthday pin (looks similar to Disneyland's/Disney World's)!!TIP: If you have dinner reservations, you can go in starting at 5pm, when doors open, so that you can enjoy some shows before dinner!! You can stay from open to close that day! So make good use of your time!TIP: If you want to leave, and you parked valet, leave when they're in between shows or else you'd get a mad rush to the door/valet, and it'll take you a long time for them to get your car! Especially if it's raining!!TIP: Dress code: Formal; check on their website to see what you can/can't wear!",5 star rating

773,11/23/2015,"This iconic establishment offers a truly unique and fun experience. The ambience is spectacular, offering great attention to detail. All of the staff are friendly and professional. Their outstanding guidance ensures a well organized venue. I can not say enough about the wonderful staff.The joint is simply ""magical"". Speaking of magic, it lives in every corner of the castle. The magicians artfully and always successfully, employ the supernatural powers to impress the skeptical masses. And with five bars at the location, the magic flows and flows. However, on my recent visit I was quite disappointed with the dinner meal. The food is not inexpensive. The servers were friendly and doing their best, but were a bit overwhelmed. We ordered a bottle of wine, but after it was brought to the table it sat unopened until we flagged down a severer half way through the meal. No bread or butter was served until we asked. We probably should have skipped the bread as it was rather hard and not fresh. The main dishes were just ok. Unfortunately, when served, the mashed potatoes and vegetables were cold. For $250+ bucks I expected better..... For being the Magic Castle, I expected better. If I were rating this venue solely on the dinner meal, I would have rated it a one star. I hope they work some magic on the restaurant. Be sure to mind the dress code and have an enchanting time!",3 star rating
774,11/22/2017,"This restroom is one of oddities of Los Angeles. Upon first entering, one might feel claustrophobic because of the extremely tight quarters. The constant rotating door of traffic comprised of both spectators and magicians only adds to the anxiety. When using the urinal, one would first question the architect's choice of installing glass splash guards... they would be hard to keep clean, and they don't provide any privacy.... But somehow, they work. Upon further inspection, the faux gas lamps and Houdini wallpaper add to it's quaint and quirky atmosphere. I was also delightfully pleased to find the faucet handles were conveniently marked hot and cold to avoid any confusion. 5 stars for this magical historic washroom.",5 star rating

I know it'll be a fun night of entertainment and BOOZE!I will say, my biggest gripe is the restaurant. You have to have reservations and it cuts into magic time, however, its probably good since were drinking so much. Service is not a quick by any means. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the best, food quality/flavor/selection is a 5. A lot of seafood and beef options, which I eat neither. I suggest eating before going, and ordering a salad or appetizer as your meal to keep it quick, affordable and so you're not disappointed.

We also didn't have to do dinner but from the small items we ate from the bar the food was good, and those having dinner looked like they had nice plates and a wonderful atmosphere. It's nice to be able to dress up and go out and have dinner and this is one of the few places you can do it almost any day of the week. Bar prices are standard for LA, but what you really come for is the magic. Everything about the atmosphere of the castle exudes the history of magic and the shows are intimate and well done. We saw three shows over the course of the night even though we showed up at ~9 p.m. I hope we can come back again soon when we are no longer poor college students!",5 star rating
779,3/12/2016,"I went here for a birthday last night for dinner and of course the Magic! I loved the old world charm the castle holds and I do enjoy the dress code because it adds to the entire experience of being transported back in time. We went to dinner at 8 pm it was my first time there and we got a mix of some really great service and a few unhelpful people. I ordered the Thai crab bisque as my appetizer it was delicious. It had some heat, it did taste almost like a curry which was intentional but half way through I couldn't take another sip because the soup was a bit too flavorful. I loved my lamb chops for my main course. It was perfectly cooked. My husband is vegetarian and got the risotto which was average. Now on to the Magic... I would highly recommend watching Max the magician and beautemp for the close up show. It was great!The castle had great charm but I do think needs to be maintained a lot better.

780,11/22/2015,"First, I must say that I love this place.  I proposed to my wife at the Magic Castle and it holds a very dear memory in our hearts.  The castle is a wonderful place to visit for entertainment and amazing food!! I have to say that starting from their reservations department (Ms. Carter) who originally assisted me in setting up my proposal to the actual experience at the castle, back then and even now, it is such an awesome experience.  You get to walk through the castle and enter into different rooms that have have a card table set up and chairs around for magicians to go and just do tricks for you (and the little crowd).  Then you have the main show which is a larger room with maybe eighty seats and they put on a great show for everyone.  A couple things to keep in mind: - it's invite only - dress attire is very strict  - you pay $13 for valet parking - guests pay $30/person entrance fee - you likely going to pay an average of $75-100/person for dinner. - Their dinners are delicious... And I really mean DELICIOUS!  - Some of the people who are around you are members and can guide you to shows or give you info you might be looking for. - Relax and have fun and enjoy your timeIf you ever get an invite I would suggest you don't pass it up... I love magic, I love trying to learn it, trying to perform it, and watching it being performed.  If any of the above apply to you, you'll enjoy your time there!!",5 star rating
781,3/8/2009,"i've driven by the Magic Castle and scoffed at how stupid the name sounds and how retarded the adjacent motel with the same name looks.  then later, i get the hype about the Castle from Stanky and was a tad curious.  Another one of these members-only or pay-an-arm Hollywood establishment.  I had forgotten about this place until J. L. emailed me about having tickets from her secret source.  Sure, I say.  I'll bring my Ignacio.This place is cool to check out once and cross it off your list.  Do it on a Sunday.   Why go when it's crowded, right?  You'll be tiptoe-ing behind shoulders all night.  Get hooked up and skip the $50 meal requirement.  Confucius once said that learning wisdom by experience is the bitterest, so better listen to you Yelpers.  The Castle is small and there's a lot of waiting around between shows.  $7 for a Pale Moon, and water + refills are free without attitude.  Nacho and I were hoping that NPH would be hanging that night but all we got was the Pick-Up Artist.  That guy is a world class doucebag.Toto the magician from Japan was the most entertaining of the night.  He will pretend to explain a trick and instead show you another trick.  He was awesome and hilarious.  The MC guy of the main show was also quite entertaining.  Magic Mike J. was pretty good too.  I hear he's an Elite Yelper?   Check out his listing on Yelp.   Too bad Cyril Takayama wasn't in the house that night.  Now THAT guy's magic is freaky.  Overall, we had a great time but we don't have any burning desires to come back.  Has anybody checked out the Magicopolis?  I've passed by that place and think it looks retarded too...maybe the show will change my mind and only if the tickets are cheaper than $27.",3 star rating

785,10/21/2018,"The Magic Castle; truly a one of a kind experience! Entrance to it's halls are exclusively restricted to only Members, Magicians, and their invitees only. Reservations are also a must, and I'd recommend to do so at minimum 2 months in advance, as it is so popular that they get booked up quickly. Everyone entering must also be 21 years of age or over with a valid ID. Dress code is formal evening wear and very strictly enforced, with gentlemen having to wear suit coats and ladies typically in evening dresses. However, the formal attire adds to the overall ambiance and feel of the entire experience. Once you approach the entrance to rest of the Castle from within the lobby, you'll know the rest of the evening will be abound with Magic & Wonder. All together, I believe there are about 5 bars inside the Castle (hence the 21 year old requirement) and several magical performances, from close up shows and sleight of hand tricks, all the way to the grand finale shows you'll receive tickets to after picking up your check upon finishing dinner. It's an overall delightful experience and I would recommend it to anyone, provided you had the means to procure a visit; ( Either being friends with a member Magician or having been given guest passes) Make sure to keep an eye out for anyone with a golden pin on their jacket, which identify the member magicians.

There were magic shows happening everywhere. I was even lucky enough to be picked as a volunteer for one of the shows, and honestly, it has to be magic. Because I had an up close side view of the performer, and really could not figure how he did it.I was also lucky enough to meet  Neil Patrick Harris. Very nice guy. My friends were star struck. There are plenty of bars on each floor, random side tricks as well. However, the one thing I didn't like were the few drunk people who were loud and inconsiderate during some of the performances.

Getting there we took a wrong turn had to make a Uturn to go up the driveway for valet. Took pictures outside with the red carpet and backdrop then proceeded inside the establishment. We mentioned it was my bday and also my soon to be bro-in-law. Got a happy bday button with our names on it. Took pictures before entering the main lounge area.  I thought it was pretty cool you have to say ""open sesame"" to the owl. Lol It worked!Once you stepped inside you got the bar in front of you. To your left is the Close Up Gallery. Staircase to your right and restroom. We went straight to dinner located upstairs. To get the tickets to the main magic show each guest is required to purchase one entree. Price ranging from $31-$48 (+18% gratuity will be added to the bill) . My boyfriend and my sister ordered the Sunset Sangria ($13).  I mentioned about having some bread, not the appetizer but just regular bread. Other yelpers mentioned it was free but you have to ask for it. The bread basket had sourdough with some kind of herb in it and some hard breadsticks. Didnt not care much for it but if you are hungry it might help to settle your stomach. I ate a protein bar on the way there. LoL I read from other reviews to make sure to eat a little something before coming in. Which was great cause of traffic getting there and by the time everyone in our party ordered and we got our food it was a good 30-40mins wait.My boyfriend ordered the Prime rib - medium 12 0z ($39) and I ordered the Garden Rissoto ($31) . The prime rib was good and 12oz is a lot. So it was great I shared it with my boyfriend. The sides it came with was very little. So the entree I ordered was perfect to have as sides. We both enjoyed our food and finished it. The rest of our group couldnt finished their prime rib and had it boxed for to go. They hold your food in the front desk so you dont have to carry it around.  That was neat, I think.For dessert I ordered the banana cream pie ($10) and a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side ($3) . I was hoping they'll give me another dessert like a  bday cake but they only placed a candle on my order and my sister's fiancé got a free dessert since it was his bday  too. He got cheesecake. The banana cream pie I thought was good and paired with ice cream. It was delicious! I love desserts. The cheesecake was way too sweet. Didnt like it. Well cant complain it was free. For our bill it came up to about $70/per person. We were then given the tickets to the show.We headed to The Palace of Mystery, 10p show. We thought it was downstairs. It was actually near where we were sitting at the dining room. Make sure to ask for directions. It was located on the lower level. One thing I noticed was it was freezing cold down there. Glad I read up on the reviews and brought a shawl with me. My bf offered his jacket but he looked so handsome in his suit, I didnt want him to ruin his  james bond look. :) The show was 45mins long. I enjoyed the show. There were some tricks I've  never seen before. I say 30% of it is new. 70% I've  seen before but it was presented differently. Afterwards we got in line for the next show which was the next room. So as soon as you exit The Palace of mystery, just a few steps to your right is the Parlor of Presdigitation. This room is smaller and you cant save seats. So good thing we got in line right away. It was an okay magic show for about 20mins. It was already 11p and I was feeling sleepy. We checked our Irma the ghost and requested her to play happy birthday on the piano. That was super cool! Wish I could have taken a video.  But camera and video not allowed inside.  Boooo! We then decided to go home it was 12mn. Got our car from valet took about 15mins. Make sure to ask for bottled water. Its a nice souvenir. Got the magic castle label on it. So to break it down.PROS: Definitely something worth experiencing once for like birthdays, anniversaries or if you are looking for something different to do.Prime rib-yummy, Garden Rissoto-yummy, Banana  Cream pie-yummyThe Palace of Mystery show-funny and goodVariety of shows (depends on what days you come in)CONS:Mandatory One entree per person to get tix to the main showPricey food and drinksOnly 21&overCant take pics inside to capture special moments",3 star rating
793,9/28/2016,"We ordered the beef wellington and the sea bass this past Saturday at the Castle. Both weregood. Manhattans Up were well crafted. :)The various magic shows and the near to you presentations after dinner were fun, interesting and awesome. We spent a total of 6 hours at the Castle and in my opinion there is no place like this in the USA. Do try not to read many of the detailed reviews; go and be surprised. But do go to their web site for details like no flip flops allowed. Also, nothing wrong with having bar bites and skipping the dinner entrees, if you get my drift.The most difficult thing will be how to get invited to the Castle. But persevere, and find or by chance bump into a magician member or someone who knows one. Once you get in, the wow begins.",5 star rating

798,5/4/2015,"I was unable to get an invite to the castle myself, but a friend of mine was nice enough to extend an invitation to me and my husband after she got a guest pass from a magician at a birthday party she attended. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I will say that whatever expectations I had, they were exceeded. I read some of the other Yelp reviews before going and was prepared to be let down, but my experience was quite the opposite. Nobody was rude and the food was decently good. Not great, but not as bad as people have made it out to be (however, I do agree that it is overpriced). There is a certain old world charm to everything inside. So many times I wanted to take photos but as you know it is strictly prohibited. Plenty of famous faces adorn the walls. Lots to explore. The castle is much bigger inside than it looks from the outside. There is literally magic everywhere you turn... in rooms, near the bar, AT the bar, etc.I didn't really know how everything was supposed to work until we got there. If you have a dinner reservation you get seated at your reservation time but before and after that you are free to roam around inside the castle and watch any of the magic shows going on at any given time. We didn't waste any time and ate as fast as we could so we could fit in as many shows as possible. The evening I went it was ""German Night"" so all of the rooms had German magicians. Our favorites of the evening were Jan Logemann and Jorg Willich in The Peller Theatre (the autographed card printer and candy bag ring trick were amazing), Nicolai Friedrich at the Parlour of Prestidigitation (loved the mind reading/astrology theme to his tricks) and Mike Pisciotta at the Hat & Hare Pub (amazing sleight of hand). I found the main stage acts at the Palace of Mystery less impressive than the more intimate, sleight of hand shows. Maybe on other nights it's very good but it was on the corny side.Overall, The Magic Castle is a very unique experience and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to experience it. Would go again in a heartbeat!",4 star rating
799,2/17/2015,"I want to sue the place! I feel terribly humiliated by the manger whose name I would like to forget because he is a disgusting human being!! My brother in law had a guest pass for 8 people and he wanted to go for my sister's bday, but we do have more friends who we love and care for so he asked me to call the place and see what I could do about it. I was happy to do it and when I called I was very specific about the questions I asked. I asked if I can bring more people who aren't members with us. I even said if it's not possible I won't make reservations. The lady who spoke to me on the phone said it was ok for us to bring all the friends and those who aren't our guests will simply have to pay a $20 fee. I thought it was great I told my friends to get ready and that we're all going to celebrate my sisters bday at the magic castle! A day later after we made the reservations I call to check with them again and make sure. This one lady Stephanie was incredibly rude at me she was yelling and scorning me for believing that I would be able to have a bigger party. So I asked to speak with a manager and see if he could help me. It was like speaking to Satan he was a complete snob arrogant and he told me I was being rude because I stood up for myself and tried to explain to him that one of his employees lied to me. The worst part was when we called our Magician friend who said he will simply get us another 8 people pass and solve our problem. But this Devil manager told him not to give us another pass!!!!!!!!! We went to the palace to try to reason with them i spoke to the hosts who work there and they agreed with me. So they called  there evil manager told my brother in law ""let's take it outside"" so when I walked outside to reason with him he totally humiliated me and told me to stay away from him. What an kind of an asshole would do that? I call him to complain that one of his employees lied to my face, then after I found a solution to our problem he messes things up and then when I tried to confront him he dares to humiliate me? The worst costumer service in my life! The food was awesome the show was amazing but I wasn't able to enjoy any of it with all of my friends.They kept telling me how there is no way to get more people in, which was ok with me but we obviously wanted to cancel since we got a wrong information and we tried to be good friends, but they threaten to charge my brother in law $200 to cancel, which made me realize that they would lie to me so I would make reservations and then they'll make money either way even if the party didn't go! Extremely disappointed!",1 star rating
800,7/24/2016,Last night was Magical! I had the privilege to attend the exclusive top secret Magic Castle. The amazing Rafael Benatar!!! I've never seen a magic show like his ever in my life! His humor and enthusiastic character was so captivating to watch! He really vibes with audience & is so humble and transparent. You feel like your having your own personal show with a family member. I would definitely see Rafael again! He was phenomenal!  The castle was timeless & if you get a chance to go YOU WILL NOT be dissapointed,5 star rating
801,10/14/2010,"The members only Magic Castle was my birthday destination on a Thursday night.  Upon entering you can see and feel the history of the place. Plenty of intricate decorations and detail throughout. We were given a private tour which was great.        After the tour we had dinner reservations to attend to.  The lobster bisque soup was flavorsome and the creamed spinach was appetizing. The cobb salad was dressed with italian dressing which was conventional, and the portobello fries had a ponzu dipping sauce.  And yes, the deviled eggs with caviar and a hint of white truffle oil was ordered.       We were able to watch several magic shows, none of the close up, but inclusive it was a sensational experience.",4 star rating
802,2/4/2017,"and I thought coming here would be a cool different thing to do on a Saturday night and boy was I in for a treat. please do come here if you want to wait in hot narrow corridors to not see a show because the rude staff is really a treat. every show we tried to go to was met with rudeness and I can't tell if it's because I'm Asian. magic castle can keep their exclusivity and ridiculous pricing. I don't need to pay good money to be disrespected over and over.gotta love how this place has a double standard when it comes to rules. I get to lose my place in line because I went to the bathroom, yet I see pics of food all over yelp.

803,6/20/2013,"I came here for the first time last weekend and I had a great time, wish I could see more!If you are a guest you pay for valet, which is not very much, but make sure you have cash.Ended up coming for the brunch on Saturday. I saw a couple of shows. My favorite show, which is one of the bigger ones, was very fun! There are tons of kids, really people of all ages. The man who was the introduction/first act, was HILARIOUS!! I could not remember his name, but older with glasses. I couldn't stop laughing.As for the decor, it is fun! It has an old mansion feel, with stairs, a couple of bars etc. For Saturday morning, the food consisted of a buffet, which i enjoyed a lot. The buffet had: bacon, shrimp cocktail, bagels and lox, waffles, pasta, dessert, fruit, salad, crab legs etc. I loved it all! However, my favorite was the mini bagels and lox.The people who worked here was very nice, but I feel they are under staffed, there were several people waiting around asking questions. If you are not an actual member and have not been here before it can be confusing about where to go and what you can do.You do have to pay an entry fee as well and pay for the buffet. This is a opened invitation only. A lot of the times you can get more ""passes' if you get a picture taken and if you buy  the picture, you get 8 tickets. The down fall is that the picture opportunities aren't available during brunch AND the tickets aren't good for the nighttime during the weekends.And remember you can't take pictures inside.As far as attire, look to the website before you attend because they are very particular.  However, I saw a man wearing dark denim jeans and sandals, which aren't allowed... so I am not sure how this works.",5 star rating
804,2/6/2017,"Score: 2.5 stars but round up to 3. I believe that the Magic Castle gets all the popularity because it is known as an exclusive club that requires a member to get in. As such, it makes you feel extremely special and exclusive.Upon entry, you are greeted with decor that is reminescent of old Hollywood glam. It is pretty run down inside, cramped, and also like a maze. The decor can function like they intend to, but because the dress code isnt as tightly enforced as it should, it doenst feel like a high end venue. ""California semi casual"" does not go well with old buildings, and it makes it seem like the clientele there arent as classy as the Magic Castle intends. If you go in on a guest pass (without a magician) you are required to pay for valet, cover fee, AND a meal. Expect to spend over 100 per person here on a given night. Unfortunately, the quality of this ""mandatory meal"" does not substantiate the price. The food is mediocre at best for the price range it is in, and definitely not worth it. You only get the tickets for the main show via the meal, so this is a clever strategy to make you drop money. If you are going here with the first time with friends who have also not been here before, you will end up wasting a lot of time. There are many smaller shows that dont require a ticket, and you have to line up for these on your own schedule. If you miss it or dont like up early, you will not get a seat. This review is not for the magic shows, but essentially they can be hit or miss. At this type of club, they should be amazing... its called the Magic Castle!!! Pick and choose carefully but the main show should be the one that you try to line up to get seats for.Overall, I think this is a place to go once just to say ""I went to the exclusive Magic Castle"", but it is not worth the money you pay unless you have a magician friend bring you in. To really bring back the glamour it wants, it needs to become even more exclusive, increase the quality/selection of food, and enforce the dress code further.",3 star rating
805,9/1/2015,This is supposedly a very exclusive club with limited entry so we got to go because we were guests of the Magic Castle Hotel next door. Warning! The dress code is definitely jacket and tie for the men and dress up for the ladies. They do have loan jackets but will turn you away if the shoes or slacks are not up to standard.The decor is fantastic and is styled from the twenties.The food is quite good as is the service. Prices for both food and beverages were very reasonable with mains around $30 and a glass of wine or spirits around $10 the only downside was two tables of VERY loud patrons.The $30 admission also includes plenty of magic with shows running almost non stop through out the building. We saw some very talented sleight of hand and illusionists performing over several hours.,4 star rating
806,2/1/2015,"The Magic Castle is a place that you have to try at least once. When your friends on facebook are all posting pictures that they have gone to the Magic Castle you start to notice something. All of the pictures look the same and consists of them standing in front of a red carpet background. Why? This is because they don't allow photography in that actual castle. You must experience it for yourself.We had a late dinner seating but got there at around 7pm on a Friday to check out some of the shows. The bar is a speakeasy style where you can order snacks and drinks (21+ only) and there are magicians roaming around doing magic tricks to entertain you. There is a lively feel to the entire place and almost a sensation that you have teleported to a different time period, where people dressed nice and had fun with drinks in an undergorund bar (1920s-30s perhaps?). The place is a maze and takes you to different rooms where there are different magicians. You also run into some bars located in different parts of the castle. The magicians age range from 20s to the 70s and you get to see different styles of illusion. There is close up magic where you sit right next to the magician and try to figure out what the illusion is and if you can see behind it. There are some tricks that keep you completely floored and you have no idea how a card or wallet go to where it was. We were seated for dinner and I ordered the NY Steak and my bf ordered the Sea bass. My steak was cooked to a medium ( I had ordered medium rare) with a side of bernaise sauce. It was okay. A standard steak that wasn't too juicy nor was it too dry. It a steak that was fine for what it was but probably not the price. The food came out to be extremely mediocre. I think the people come here for the magic tricks and the experience rather than the food. I wonder if there is an option to skip the dinner and just go to the main magic show afterwards. It might save us a little money.Overall, it is something that you must do. I would advise this to be something good for a group of friends who are looking for a nicer evening out. Find a magician friend who can give you access or you can get your photograph take and get 8 passes for Sunday through Thursday!",3 star rating

810,5/27/2013,"I had never heard of the Magic Castle until Husband started talking about it and how it had been a dream destination since he was a kid.  So, when we were going to be arriving in LA a night before a cruise, it was the perfect opportunity to make Husband's dream come true.  Thanks to some awesome friends who live in Ventura, we were escorted around in style and were happy to treat them in return to a night at The Castle.  I confess to being a little nervous, as I really didn't know what to expect, despite having thoroughly checked out the very informative website.  DO familiarize yourselves with the dress code and other info before you go.  DO make reservations well in advance if you are going to do a Saturday night like we did.  The place got very packed.   Dress right for their code, but make it comfortable.  Ladies, keep in mind you and your shoes will be climbing stairs.  You won't want to miss checking out happenings on every level of this cool mansion.  Might want to consider layers as well.  When we first arrived for our 6:00 reservations, it was FREEZING in there.  By the time we left, it had warmed up considerably.     I'm surprised to find pics here on Yelp, as we are told rather strongly not to take pics inside, even in the bathrooms.  (yes, they say that).  There is a photographer who took our pic (only after we paid him).  He will select the photo, but he does guarantee it.  We were happy with ours, and considering what they wanted for pics on the cruise ship, this was nicer and a better deal.     Dinner was quite nice and service was excellent.  I had a fish dish that is not on the menu that is online.  It had taken the place of the trout.  Others had beef and loved it.  We shared a calamari appetizer that was so-so.  And we shared a lava-type chocolate dessert that was very good. With our dinner came tickets to the main show at 7:30.  As much as I enjoyed that, I got an even bigger kick out of all the smaller ""shows"" throughout the mansion.Loved sitting in the parlor, for instance, with a Gentleman who did a couple amazing card tricks.  How cool!  Love the up close and personal stuff.   We were lucky enough to have been seated at Cary Grant's table.  (I sat in his seat!)  The history in this building is not just seen everywhere, but felt as well.I do wish we had arrived early or at a time where we could have gotten an official tour. Can only imagine how much more fascinating history we would have heard about.  But to be able to wander this incredible mansion and discover pic after pic and memento after memento was an experience we'll never forget.",5 star rating
811,4/17/2013,"The famous and historic Magic Castle is nothing short of magical: if you go with an open attitude you are sure to have an unusual night of entertainment that is memorable and quite an interesting experience. Ambiance: The whole castle reminded me of the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland except for adults (exclusively wealthy and privileged adults.) It is very classy, there are little secrets and mysteries to explore around and enjoy. The place is adorned with artifacts with historical and magical significance- arrive early, grab a drink, and you can relax in the lounge or walk around the castle. 5/5Food: The food is pricey and terrible. I tried some of my friend's filet and my new york was overly chewy despite my medium rare request. Skip the meal and wait in line for shows. 1/5Entertainment:I like shows, and although I've seen better magic I was still enjoying my time. We saw performers from England and Taiwan and very different styles of magic throughout the night. I generally laughed a lot and I think there's something for everyone. Oh- make sure to say to Irma- she scared me a little but it was cool to see a self-playing piano! 4/5I've been looking for an in for over two years so my expectations were pretty high, and although I was a little disappointed in some of the performances I would want to come again. I feel like every experience would be unique depending on the performers, crowd, and group you attend with. Definitely recommended for a different night out in LA!",4 star rating
812,4/5/2015,"Wow, OMG, whoa...these were common phrases to best describe how I felt at the time I got to experience my first visit at the Magic Castle, it was a magical night that can't be replicated anywhere else.  Hollywood serves as a perfect backdrop to this place, I even saw a couple actors (Sean Kanaan and Colin Ferrell) on the night (4/4/2015) I ventured into this magical place.  As you anticipate your entrance, you can take photos of the exterior and there is a ""step & repeat"" which can serve as the background to your only photo you can take with your camera.  Once you enter the doors, no photography allowed and phones have to be on silent or vibrate.  We arrived at 5pm which was ample time to assemble with the group of 8 I belonged to.  At 5:30pm, we entered the lobby area and paid $30 per person for the admission. Then to enter, we had to look into the red eyes of an owl statue and say ""open sesame"" for the doors to slide open.  We walked to the bar area and our eyes were entertained with pictures and fixtures on the wall, some of which had eyes following us.  There was a ""piano ghost"" named Irma who takes song requests and never seems to take a break, always playing a tune.  We went to the first show which was a magician named Tim Issac at the close-up gallery, it was a full house so a couple of us had to stand, but I didn't mind since it was just for 15 minutes.  We then had appetizers and drinks at the bar: calamari, truffle crinkle cut fries, and a sangria.  Well worth the time to satisfy our taste buds before our 8pm dinner seating.  We saw a couple magic shows in the basement and it flowed so well that we were just in time for dinner upstairs.  I had the Colorado rack of lamb and a side of mac & cheese to share with my sister.  We also had the garlic cheese bread, very cheesy!  For dessert I had the dark chocolate ice cream and tried a bite of the banana cream pie with nutter butter crust, so good!  Our main event was the 10pm show at the Palace of Mystery starring Larry Wilson, Lady Mystina, and the Dream Makers, all very original with their magic acts and left some of us breathless with a lot of ""oohs"" & ""ahhhs.""  Along the way, I got a cut out silhouette for $15 and it took only 2 minutes for the guy to make it.  We also made sure to take a photo with the photographer for $20 so we could get the guest pass good for up to 8 people including yourself for one year.  Make sure to look around the whole place as you walk, there was even a telephone booth where if you go inside and answer the call, there's a skeleton that lights up before your eyes.  The bathrooms were clean, staff were very informative and nice, and the whole experience was magical beyond compare.  Thanks Magic Castle and the Academy of Magical Arts for a magical evening!",5 star rating
813,12/29/2015,"There's nothing that warms my heart more than a touch of magic in the air. The enchanted Magic Castle is an exclusive venue offering fine dining, drinks, and of course... spectacular magic shows. An exclusive invite only requirement and dress to impress atmosphere allows visitors to feel elite and gain a sense of prestige. If you're trying to splurge, the venue also offers a private luxurious Houdini Séance Chamber where guests can have a four course meal surrounded by Houdini's real memorabilia and experience other majestic phenomenas.   While walking through the gothic châteauesque castle, your mind is filled with curiosity as the venue has mystery lurking in every corner. Drinks are strong, food is fair, and magicians are constantly changing giving each visit new trickery to captivate your imagination. Performances include The Palace of Mystery, The Close-Up Gallery, The Peller Theater, The Parlour of Prestidigitation, and The W.C. Fields Bar. To enjoy this experience to the fullest extent, I'd recommend seeing as many shows as possible, raise your hand when magicians ask for a volunteer, explore every hall of the castle, pay attention to detail, recommend a song for invisible Irma the ghost to play on the piano, and take in every beautiful moment.   This is an unforgettable experience unlike anything else that exists.",5 star rating
814,11/25/2012,"I was finally able to experience a magical night at the exclusive Magic Castle! Doors open at 5 pm and even though our dinner reservation was for 8 pm, we arrived at 6 pm. Valet is $8 and non-member cover is $25 pp. A strict dress code is enforced -- ladies may wear a cocktail dress or pants suit and men have to wear a suit and tie.My girlfriend had the honor of saying the two magic words ""Open Sesame"" to the owl sitting on the bookcase, and a part of the bookcase swung open and let us through into the Grand Salon and Main Bar. Our first stop was the museum, where Phil Van Tee showed us rope tricks in a very intimate setting, which started off our evening perfectly. The Magic Castle has a total of 5 bars and some of the bartenders (like the one at the Hat & Hare Lounge) will perform magic tricks as well. We also visited Invisible Irma, who supposedly haunts and plays the piano in the room... and also takes song requests! Can't figure out how they do it, but if you just ask Irma to play a song, the piano will start playing whatever you request! In the Close-Up Gallery, Fenik performed a 20 minute show and blew my mind with his final trick... and as he promised, I'm still wondering how the hell he did it.Dinner time rolled around so we went up to the 2nd floor and were seated promptly. I ordered the Garlic Bread and although it was crazy cheesy, it was really good... a lot better than my Salmon entree, which was nothing special. The rice pilaf it came with tasted like it came straight out of a school cafeteria. My boyfriend ordered the Prime Rib, which was decent. I also tried a bit of my friend's dishes and the NY Steak was also decent, but my favorite was probably the Lobster & Shrimp Ravioli. My girlfriend and I shared the Chocolate Lava Cake with Vanilla ice cream which was pretty yummy. The bill came to $330 with tax and tip for six entrees, two appetizers, one dessert, and a bottle of Magician Riesling.Our server gave us all tickets for the main magic show at the Palace of Mystery and for 45 minutes, we watched Mark Haslam, Shoot Ogawa, and Caramel Machine perform. Out of the three, I enjoyed Caramel Machine the most; Odaji is quite the character! After another 45 minute show at the Peller Theater starring Eric Buss and Chris Mitchell, I saw enough magic to last me for the next five years. I hung out at a bar while my friends enjoyed an intimate show by Bill Joslin. We left soon afterwards around 1 am, but not before snapping a bunch of photos in the lobby -- which is the only place you're allowed to take photos. Otherwise, no photography is allowed inside the walls of Magic Castle!Unfortunately, we didn't see Neil Patrick Harris (he's the President)... but we did see Shia LaBeouf and his Nymphomaniac costar Mia Goth. We sat less than six feet away from them during the main magic show and witnessed them both acting like drunken fools; definitely made the night much more interesting.The Magic Castle is a unique place and I had fun, but I'd be hesitant to come back anytime soon. The reason for the 3 stars is because ""a-ok"" is exactly how I feel -- while I appreciated and enjoyed all the magic tricks I saw during my visit, it got old and repetitive after awhile.

The magicians were alright but I really enjoyed the crowds reaction and participants responses to what they were experiencing. This place gets really crowded sometimes so bring a snorkel if the hosts allow you to haha. The dress code is strictly enforced, always bring extra shoes a tie and pants in case your friends forget something... Trust me. That is if you don't want to wear the ""loaner"" pants behind the magic door ;-) Show up 30 minutes early to your reservation dressed to the 9s! (With the extras in the car just in case they don't like your style) NO TENNIS SHOES OR JORDANS/AIRMAX...Only Dress shoes damnit! Valet is 13$ and the rest inside is up to you. Don't come on an empty stomach because your wallet will regret it. Eat a sandwich or 2 before you go! Take a granola bar to munch on. My favorite magicians were not in the show rooms but downstairs in the ""dungeon"". Card tricks, book tricks, mind games n such... I got to participate in a trick and my mind was blown. So was the person in the act with me. The food is expensive (delicious however) and the portion's definitely not worth the price. 11$ for garlic fries is kind of a lot... Tbh. Drinks were exceptional from the Top bar. Valet was totally efficient. Chris and his team really kept things moving and snappy. He even showed me how to make my tie a lot nicer and fastened me with a legendary knot. Cheers! Will return soon! Thanks for the Owl Pin.Namaste",5 star rating
816,12/23/2014,"Wow! This place is spectacular. However, you do need to know someone with a membership to get in so if you have the chance to come here don't skip out!The Magic Castle is a two-story mansion on top of a hill a few blocks away from the Walk of Fame with over 15 rooms a small theater and a couple dens where magicians perform scheduled acts. Magicians perform everything from small tricks to more advanced and spectacular magic with fire and even a lucky audience member (be prepared). Come early and explore the castle! With all the rooms and theaters, you're sure to find quirky and strange artifacts as well as secret doors that lead to other rooms. Don't be shy. DRESS CODE: Black tie event-dress code. If you feel you're too dressed up, you're A-OK. This is the place to do that! Women come in with fur coats, shiny jewelry, red lips, and expensive stilettos. Guys, you ABSOLUTELY NEED to wear dress pants or slacks, dress shoes and suit or blazer WITH a tie. They offer loaner pants, ties and jackets but trust me you don't want to wear them. DRINKS: If you're a beer or wine drinker, for a ritzy, members only establishment, drinks won't break the bank. Wine and beer start at about $7. Fancy? Cocktails are $14 and up. TIP: If you come on Thursday-Saturday nights it will be BUSY. Arrive early. Once inside the mansion, they are STRICT and don't allow late entry into shows out of respect to magicians. Grab a drink, line up 15 mins before for guaranteed entry and a seat. PARKING: Valet $10 or you can park offsite and walk up the winding road. Not as bad as you think actually. We live in LA, there's no magic trick to help with the parking situation.",5 star rating
817,11/3/2013,"What can I say... the atmosphere here is spot on!  A castle with some history and decor that screams magic in a fun way!The magic was mind blowing.  I half expected them to conjure a ghost or shoot fireballs out of their hands.  I got to participate in one of the magic tricks involving a deck of cards.  After the magician handed it to me, he never touched the deck and still managed to pull his trick off.  :OI didn't try the food here... sorry people!  I did get drinks though and they do serve them stiff!Dress code:  Classy.  Suit up, folks.While you're here, explore the castle.  There are hidden fun gems/facts about the place!  (for example, go into the phone booth!)",5 star rating
818,11/18/2015,"Let me just say: the dining experience at The Magic Castle was ... MAGICAL. We get it, you're in the magic castle for magic and the required dining might seem like a drag but the truth of the matter is the service (shout out to HECTOR and JEFFREY) is impeccable and attentive. We were constantly tended to (a party of 5) and it was really reassuring to know that all our needs were met (food allergies, etc.). Highly recommend going to a late evening show and grabbing dinner + a cocktail beforehand!",5 star rating
819,11/20/2017,Love coming here with my beautiful wife. It's is a fine dining restaurant with a live magic show. To get in you either have to be a member or be invited by a member. We've been fortunate enough to be invited a few times. It's so cool!!! They charge for valet and I believe it's like a $25 or $30 entrance fee. Since it is members only you are not allowed to take any pictures inside the building. Only the outside and the small lobby area. Once you go in and pay your entrance fee you walk to a bookshelf and say open sesame and the book shelf opens!!!! It's awesome!!! It leads you to a fancy cool bar where you can hang out before your reservation. The restaurant is upstairs and they take you to your table. During dinner they give you tickets for the magic show which is in a small auditorium. After the show you're free to roam around the castle where magicians in different rooms are doing tricks for the guests. They even have a piano that's plays whatever song you want. You just tell it to play it and it plays the song you said with nobody there! Super cool. The only reason I doesn't get 5 stars is because the main magic show room is always to warm inside where it's like I'm sweating. It's stuff and the seats are too close together. Also the last show wasn't that great. Overall great experience and I highly recommend it!,4 star rating
820,10/29/2015,"Wow!!! What an amazing experience! Visited The Magic Castle a couple weeks ago. My boyfriend is a huge fan of magic, where I am really inexperience. He got us an invite by another member. After we check in, we get in line right away for a show. The room fit about 20-30 people. They asked two females to sit up front. I volunteered! This magician did mostly coin magic. I was sitting 2 feet from him and had no clue how he did anything! The next room we went to was in an open room next to one of the few bars. We came in while a magician was doing card tricks. Again, great show! My boyfriend and I went into the bar (bartender was no where to be found) and a group of magicians walked by and two of them switched off doing a private show for the two of us. Very cool! Our dinner was scheduled at 9pm and we called earlier and got an earlier reservation. Dinner was fantastic!! To start, we ordered Calamari and Roasted Beets and Burrata Cheese which were great. For my entrée, I ordered the Rack of Lamb which was incredible. My boyfriend ordered the Jumbo Shrimp which was good, not great. We got a desert, but I can't remember what it was. Overall, I was very pleased and satisfied!After dinner, we made our way into the big theater for our last show. It was a combination of comedy and more magic. Another great show!Overall, The Magic Castle was an amazing experience. I'd recommend to all my friends and family. A couple tips i'd make, are to make reservations a week or so in advance and arrive extra early for reservations to enjoy as many shows as you can. And if there are any Hollywood Bowl shows playing, try to avoid when the show is beginning or ending. We sat in traffic, there and back, for over an hour.",5 star rating
821,5/6/2013,"Lives up to the hype. Magic Castle is a must-see. Plenty of wonderful shows and history all around you. You gotta love a place where you enter behind a moving bookcase. Yes, the drinks are a bit spendy, but you're here to relax, right? So, relax, and let them work their magic on you here. I haven't been to the restaurant, nor the hotel. I've at this point, only loitered at the WC Fields Bar (once called the Hello Dolly Bar, since it appears in that movie). I watched the sleight of hand and easy delivery of Jon Armstrong. (Full disclosure, I've met Jon over the years through the Hollywood Fringe Festival).I look forward to returning and seeing some of the shows-in-theatres. I don't even consider myself a huge fan of Magic -- but Magic Castle is undeniably well-worth finding your way inside.",4 star rating
822,10/17/2012,"Had the best experience here with the boyfriend. See what had happened was that about 2 years ago, my boyfriend had showed me the Magic Castle's website and began a long explanation of what it is all about. He wanted to go so badly but sadly, none of us could make it happen. And for the past 2 years, I've been trying to make it happen like any girlfriend would. Then one of my great Yelp friend, Phillip N. happened to check-in the month of my boyfriend's birthday this past month. I was so ecstatic when he helped me out and referred me to Nelson F. who was more than kind enough to send me a guest invitation.  Booking reservations is hard. Don't expect to get a Saturday night as it is booked until the end of the year. With the guest pass, we were required to dine in their restaurant but got two tickets to the main show. Being it was our first time, I didn't mind. Got reservation for 8PM on a Sunday night and our show time was for 10PM. One of the things I should note to first timers, try to go for a 6PM dinner. Most of the shows start at 7PM and later so dinner before you roam around will best allocate your time efficiently. I didn't know that so for an hour or so we were requesting songs to Irma and got a tour from a Knight by the name of Mike. He was unbelievably friendly and nice. Showed us around and explained about all the history of Magic Castle. Really made the visit more educational for my boyfriend and I. He also recommended that we see Helder Guimarães so the boyfriend and I got in line an hour before to guarantee a seat. Helder was funny and amazing. We got to sit front and center and my boyfriend was even chosen as the volunteer. While we were waiting, an older couple told us about Helder Guimarães and Derek DelGaudio and that we were in for a treat because it so happened, both of them were performing that night. After Helder the boyfriend and I went to dinner. Got salmon and Lobster tail. The overall dish was nice and worth the price. My boyfriend got the prime rib, full of fatty goodness and juicy meat. The mashed potato was also delicious. Service was great just like everywhere else in the castle. People here were extremely nice and it was appreciated as we really didn't know the norms of the castle. We dined right next to Mac King which was awesome. But that wasn't the best part. After dinner we skipped the main show and went to Derek DelGaudio per the couple's strong advice. So glad we did! He performed in the Close-Up Gallery which only seated 22 people and we were one of the firsts in line. Derek DelGaudio was also amazing and Helder was somewhat part of his act. We met some really cool magicians while waiting whom showed us some magic as well. After the two shows and dinner, it was getting late and it was a Sunday night. We were walking out of the gallery discussing about what a perfect night it was and how much fun we had when there stood NPH in the center of the room. Our jaws dropped. After speaking with the host and several knights, we were convinced NPH doesn't come often and when he does, you'll miss him by a hair. We accepted that we would most likely not see him. But there he stood. Looking as poise as he does on HIMYM. It was the cherry to the most perfect ice cream sundae ever. It was legen.... wait for it... DARY! $8 for valet. $20 admission. Say ""Open sesame"" to the owl to let you in. Feel free to walk everywhere and I do mean anywhere you want. I'm really looking forward to coming back again hopefully. The experience of the Magic Castle is truly magical. I cannot thank Phillip N. and Nelson F. enough. The boyfriend said it was the best birthday ever!",5 star rating
823,10/26/2017,"Had so much fun here recently. I love the mystique of this place and how it casts a veneer of exclusivity.

827,1/19/2013,"(See pics) Review #1301. I was fortunate to know David M, an internationally known close-up magician, to have a chance visiting the Magic Castle.Love love love magic. Even if I did not blink, I looked really hard, I analyzed, I still cannot figure out how it is done.Magic is when you become a believer. I become a believer.The performances here are miraculous and will blow your mind away. The castle hosts world famous magicians and in the evening I visited, some were from Australia and England. You will be sure to have hours of enjoyment as you turn after turn to discover in different rooms. And in between the shows, get one of those stiff drinks and carry it with you as you are being mesmerized.No pictures are allowed once inside the castle, so it keeps the magic mysterious. And because each week there are different magicians, you know each visit will be unique.",5 star rating

829,11/26/2018,"My family and I visited the castle on November 17th- My som Alexs 15th bday was November 22 so the date was perfect to celebrate his bday! It was the best time my son has ever had. He's 15, and he has Tourette's Syndrome, he also has the famously know cursing tic coprolalia, it is very rare. It causes him to say profanities, he can't control what he says, how loud or how often he says it. Due to that, He doesn't usually get to go out and do normal stuff because of the public's misunderstanding of his medical condition, it causes a lot of stress on him and myself- We were a little afraid to actually bring him to such an exclusive place, fearing he would offend so many people with his cursing. I emailed Jennifer at the castle ahead of time to explain my son's medical condition and ask that she let the staff know about him before we got there so that hopefully he wouldn't be shamed by people or kicked out for a change. Upon arriving at the Castle, the front door man already knew who Alex was, he assured us that mostly everyone did and that he will have a great experience. From the moment we walked in it was just amazing! Erma the piano ghost will play any song you ask her to, the bartenders were very pleasant, drinks were reasonably priced. About 11-15 per drink- very similar to Vegas pricing. The atmosphere was just breath taking! So much history to look at and read, it makes you feel like a kid again. We seen a few shows, David and Aaron were great, the others were also I just can't remember names! The magic was close up and on point! Everyone there had a great time just like we did! We did brunch because that's the only time they allow children into the castle! The brunch menu was absolutely fantastic. They served crab legs, prime rib, a variety of salads and pastas, seafood, tasty desserts and of course my favorite- bottomless mimosas! We dined in the Houdini séance room all by ourselves! It was great! The memories we left with are def worth the price and the travel! I hope one day my husband and I could experience the Castle during the evening! It sounds like a blast! PS.. if anyone would like to send us an invitation for the evening that would be amazing!!! I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. Oh! Also, if you let them know prior that it's someone's bday- they will have a birthday button for you!",5 star rating

Ventriloquist Christine Barger is wonderful too. Please pick out fancy clothes and just GO!!!!",5 star rating
834,5/16/2016,"Their main shows are amazing. Food needs a definite improvement for its $40 price tags. Dinner is required for entry on top of the $30 entry fee. Entree purchase is required per person. Food lacks flavor and portion. (The jidori chicken is a piece of chicken w/ sauce on it and mashed potatoes). -_-Be prepared for a gross over-charge the more people you have in your party.Can get crowded and filled with obnoxious drunk patrons as the night progresses which can ruin the magician's effect on the audience..

835,11/28/2014,"I'm surprised to see so many high ratings for this place.  Especially while reading the reviews and seeing high stars from people who also mentioned that the food was not very good.  That is my number one reason for giving a low rating for The Magic Castle.  They require that you have dinner before your show and the food was terrible.  I ordered the chicken, my husband ordered salmon.  They both came out ice cold.  Gross!  The au gratin potatoes that came with my chicken looked like the kind you make from a box and the 3 little veggies on the plate were completely over cooked and sad looking.  They are also very strict with their dress code.  I love any occasion that requires getting dressed up, but I feel like the staff should have matched that requirement.  Every staff member that we encountered, besides the gentlemen seating us for the show, looked frumpy.  Even the performers were wearing cheap, tacky looking outfits.  They were all very nice, but they looked like characters from some tacky murder mystery thing.  The actual magic show was pretty low-budge.  I thought we were going to see some really spectacular magic, but it was your typical hocus pocus, abracadabra type stuff.  A few interesting illusions here and there, but overall...yawnOur group had a good time overall.  I will say that this was a unique experience, and there were some fun things we encountered while exploring the mansion.  Just a little too cheesy and touristy for my taste.",2 star rating

839,7/22/2015,"Another visit and it just gets better! Our waiter, Celina, was the best ever at the Castle and one of our favorites of any restaurant. Celina quickly pointed out the new menu offerings from the new executive chef (the filet mignon topped with Dungeness crab was perfect ), explained menu items in Spanish to our Columbian guest, was spot on in her visit timing and her sparkling enthusiasm made us wish she could have a seat with us. Very special! The food preparation of items we've had before was better (lamb rack, before Wellington) and our guest was extremely pleased with the Chilean sea bass selection. The new creme brulee and banana cream pie desserts topped  off a great dinner. The Palace of Mystery show this week spotlights three very funny and adept magicians that totally surprised us.

They know exactly the amount of people who are arriving each night and should be organized enough that everyone can see all the shows. That really was my biggest frustration.

I would give 5 stars if this past Sunday experience at Magic Castle would have been at least as good as we remember the last. We had fun!!!! Still nice around there but disappointing. Was such a poor selection of shows even though they have so many show rooms. The shows we saw were very short and not too ""magical"". Come one..,, it can be better then that. I still enjoyed the tricks and I love to believe in magic. They need more magicians around!!!! It's true we went for brunch but I doubt at night it changes too much. We walked around and it felt empty... The downstairs looked abandoned but we hope they are just going through some remodeling to refresh the atmosphere. We like it old looking, that's the charm at Magic Castle but they need to bring it alive!!!! More magicians, please!!!!!! We saw Nicholas Cage! That was fun! The food: well... well... well... Was just OK. Smelled funny around and that was because of the carpet(needs to be refreshed). Would be more fun if presentation would be like magic:)) I am sure they can find fun ideas other then just a plain, mediocre buffet area. Again: last time I remember a delicious fancy dinner. What happened  to that fancy???!!??? Nancy not so fancy... I felt overdressed:(( I hope I get to go again and find it packed with magicians. I would love to walk around to see the beautiful decorated walls, checking out the little tricks hidden around and have a magician play a tick on us:)))) getting a coin out of my ear:)))))) see a bunny under somebody's hat:)) or purse...

Get liquored up trying to outwit the invisible pianist (you won't, but you'll have a great time trying). And then, the shows. Live magic. Vegas-style shows with big cool tricks. Funny schitck from magicians working the hallway with rope and card tricks. Up-close sleight-of-hand. Mementos of Golden Age Hollywood everywhere. Then, wander to the downstairs bar and make a friend with a magician and maybe they'll teach you a thing or two over yet another drink.Maybe parts of it seem cheesy, but they're cheesy in a good, fun way. Uber or Lyft is the way to go here -- it's an amazingly entertaining, likely very boozy, massively fun night out.

None of the entrees looked good but they are cool enough to let you mix and match appetizers and salads if you get to $35ish - which is the price of an entree. Food as you imagine isn't great. Magic makes me uncomfortable apparently. I think my big mistake was not being totally hammered. Hammered like the woman in front of me in the Palace of Mystery who was heckling the magician.

849,10/10/2012,"Had an amaaaaazing time here last night thanks to a good friend who happens to be a member here.  Since he came with us, we didn't have to have dinner - just grabbed some drinks at the numerous bars located throughout the castle.  I hear that if you don't come with a member, you have to pay an entrance fee + have dinner, which is rather pricy.  I obviously cannot comment on the quality of the food, but the whole ambiance here is really fun; everybody is in a great mood and the service was excellent throughout the place.  I can't imagine dinner would be an unpleasant experience.  It's a really fun place that's great for a special night out.  Suit and tie are required for men, so I had to run out and grab one for my brother, who was my ""date"" for the night.    And come on, ladies, who doesn't like an excuse to get all dolled up for a night out?  Especially here in LA when you see people in JEANS at the opera on a Saturday night - I take any excuse I can get!  The venue itself is an old Victorian mansion, and it's really amazing how they've maintained the original structure and architecture.  There are many rooms all throughout the place, and different magicians perform in them.  They perform at specified times, which are posted outside the doors.  The shows are amazing and they leave you feeling like you totally had your mind blown.  The magicians are also super friendly and you get to see them just hanging out at the bar before and after the show, which is also a really fun treat - how often do you get to enjoy a mindblowing show then rub elbows with the performer immediately after?  Overall, I had a ridiculously fun night here, and can't wait to come back.",5 star rating

The only reason I don't give it the full 5 start is because the food is....how do I say this....I don't want to be mean....this food is....OK, the food is terrible. Like, really, really bad. Eat before you visit if you can. Also, dress code is strict. The will not let you in if you are not dressed alright. A note for the ladies, though, when they say elegant cocktail attire, they don't mean a dress that you would wear to the club after you just broke up with your man and are thirsty. Cover it up a little.... there are older clientele here, and you'll probably feel uncomfortable if you're under-dressed like that.",4 star rating

856,1/22/2015,"I visited for the first time this week and had an outstanding time.I took the Metro to the Hollywood/Highland stop so I can't speak for their valet service, but everything else was very classy and well handled. From the front door security to the wait staff and the magicians, everyone was great. There are tons of hallways and rooms to explore, and lots of memorabilia on display.The magic was good but their comedy was even better - just laugh out loud funny. I was wheezy and phlegmy by the end of the night.The dinner service was also really good. A bit pricey but still delicious. Their Beef Wellington is actually just a thick slice of the steak/pastry, and not an entire round pastry. The crust on the banana cream pie was too hard and firm for my liking but not terrible.I would also like to add how disappointed I am in my fellow Yelpers that blatantly disregard the Magic Castle's rule to not take photographs inside. If you enjoy an establishment, please grow up and respect their policies. There's a red carpet setup outside if you want to take pictures of your group.",5 star rating

Pre-game with some tacos before you go and then order a salad with some appetizers is what I would do next time. Because we had a variety of entrees for a party of 6 and our taste buds were not satisfied. Get your ticket and go to as many little shows you can. Overall it was a fun experience because I love magic and the charisma of all of the magicians. I would come back, but not ball out on the dinner. The biggest magic trick they had was making $400 disappear from my bank account. Amazing.",4 star rating
859,11/20/2017,"One of my favorite places in Los Angeles. I've been a couple times now and I never fail to have a blast. You need to book weeks or even months in advance if you want to get the dinner and main show time of your preference. But it's more than worth the planning. The food and service are really good. And the magic is, as you might suspect, fantastic. My friends and I went this weekend and were very impressed by Anthony Blake, a visiting magician. He was a wonderful mentalist and we loved his show. But my favorite part of the Magic Castle will always be Mike at the Hat & Hare pub. He is hands down the best magician I've ever seen. If you go to the Magic Castle and don't swing by to see him, you are missing out on the best act in the house. Seriously. His act is flawless and he's incredibly entertaining. If magic exists, Mike has mastered it.",5 star rating
860,3/6/2013,"The MAGIC Castle truly is an incredible place, as you walk around you feel like you're in the 1930's and 40's and can't help but believe it. It's so nice to see a diverse group of people coming together all dressed up and looking snazzy. The Magic of course is amazing, difficult to fathom the time they put into mastering the craft and the magicians themselves are so incredibly nice. The food is pretty phenonmenal I heard it wasn't so good a few years ago, but the a rep came up to us and asked how everything was and if they could fix any problems, which their were none of course.The drinks are delicious, I had a black russian, kahlua and cream, jack and coke and the bar staff is excellent. The atmoshpere is amazing and you truly feel like this is one of the places everyone should visit and experience. If you buy a photo they take of you as well you get an admission or invitation to the magic castle you can redeem within the year.

861,3/2/2018,"Came here for Sunday brunch and would never come again. $15 valet, $25 entrance fee, $45 for brunch plus tax and tip comes to about $100. It's extremely overpriced and just not worth it. The Magic Castle is very outdated and looks like it hasn't been updated in years, if not decades. There was a very, very small selection of food available for the buffet brunch. I've been to many other places for brunch and typically you get so much more when paying nearly $50. The magic was mediocre at best. It was mostly card tricks that one has seen many times before. I used the main level ladies room before leaving and there was a sound track playing of pooping and farting sounds. Considering you have to dress up to attend  this establishment I found that sound track to be in such poor taste.",1 star rating
862,1/14/2015,"What an amazing place! Magic Castle is really one of those places you need to come atleast once esp if you live in LA.  Located in the heart of Los Angeles (Hollywood), the Castle was built in 1909 and there is definitely a historic vibe the moment you walk in.  Had dinner reservations at 8:30pm so my date and I got there around 7:00pm to check-in and to catch the ""Prestidigitation"" show which ended up being an awesome opening. For dinner, minus a star because I thought the food was really whatevers. My cocktail (yuzu something) was way too syrup-y and I could have gotten a better seabass at Cheesecake Factory.  The warm sweet bread rolls with whipped butter however, was sooo good!! Skip the dinner or if you want to experience the whole shabang including the dine-in just get a bunch of appetizers to munch on.The second show ""The Palace of Mystery"" was about 45 minutes and Chris Mitchell was hilarious! It really made the night not only intriguing with magic shows but also very entertaining and comic.  For the ""Late close-up"" the room was a lot smaller than the other rooms we previously went into and let me tell you... it is ALL about the close-up shows!! Mark Matsumoto was amazing and I literally tripped out beginning to the end!! Make sure you stay in line 20 minutes before the show starts so you can sit right in the front or else you would need to sit in the back or stand to the sides (trust, totally worth it)!!  Overall my night at the Magic Castle was exactly what I expected it to be and I will definitely return when I get a chance to go again.. hopefully very VERY SOON!  INVITES ONLY from the magicians or a member of the Magic Castle.  Dress Code: Dressy (Suit/cocktail dress/coat/etc) no jeans, t-shirts, sneakers, etc you get the idea.Valet also takes card if you don't have cash on you.",4 star rating
863,11/25/2012,"The entertainment here is great!  They change up the magicians every week so the chances of you seeing the same magician a few months down the line are slim to none.  I come here about 3 times a year since my dad is a member and likes to take his guests out to this venue.  I am never disappointed with any of the shows.  They have an assortment of games and things to fiddle with down the hallways. I wish they would make an effort and fix the ones that are broken because I couldn't get to work at least 5 of the things that tell you to push the button to watch something.The food is satisfactory, not amazing.  I think the best dish they have is the garlic bread (appetizer).  The garlic bread seems simple, but you have to get them!  It really just melts in your mouth, one of the best garlic breads I've had.  You can pass on the appetizers, not worth it. The entrees are okay.  I think out of all of them, I would recommend the prime rib.  For women, you don't have to be too dressed up, just a simple cocktail dress or Sunday dress is fine.  However, the men need to wear a suit jacket or at least a sports jacket in order to go in and the shoes must be dress shoes!",4 star rating
864,10/24/2012,"The Magic Castle is a place that delights the senses and recaptures a feeling of wonderment faster than you can say ""Open Sesame"" (and you will, believe me).A chateau styled structure that stands in stark contrast to the nearby glittering buildings of Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards, the Magic Castle has a rustic yet ornate interior where a sense of history and discovery await those who pay attention to the details - and also don't get distracted by the bars...or the invisible piano player who handles any request (I think I've heard the best version of Justin Bieber's ""Baby, Baby""). I was also amazed by the mini exhibits sprinkled throughout the building...the miniature Haunted Mansion diorama (yes, related to the popular Disney attraction) stuck out in particular. A past member of the Magician's Club had built within it, disappearing ghost figurines to show Walt Disney that such a tangible ""illusion"" was feasible.Perhaps the only very minor disappointment I had with my whole experience was the mildly pricey dinner in the building's ornately late-19th century styled dining area. My braised short rib rigatoni was a bit dry when it came to the pasta - but at least the braised short rib was succulent and tender. Service was also excellent - I can't say enough about how attentive and helpful our servers were. One of the major highlights of The Magic Castle has to be the live acts and you will definitely find a variety of these shows, both large and small, occupying every corner and floor of the Magic Castle. Smaller acts usually consist magicians performing card and rope tricks at card tables. TIP: try to get into the larger shows earlier - although they have take place in their own rooms, seating is VERY limited. Although I didn't see too many magic tricks in the show I saw, it was nonetheless an incredibly entertaining event that demanded much audience participation.Cocktail styled dress is required. There's also 20 buck entrance fee. If you ever get the chance to go (only by invitation), TAKE IT. Perhaps the biggest magic trick of your experience would be the ability to find street parking in this crowded area, if you don't want to do valet.Much thanks to Johnny L., if he can read this, for getting us in!",5 star rating

I loved that my husband and I got to dress up and it was a great couples night out with friends. The only ""warnings"" I'd give to first timers like us are... read the web site rules!! Lol we were 10 min late to our show and couldn't get in so that was a bummer, lesson learned DONT BE LATE!! Also, it's pricy so save up!! I would say that if you plan on having dinner and having two drinks each you are looking at about $300 including valet and the $30 entry fee (each) All in all it was a good time and I would recommend this place as a couples night out or special celebration.",4 star rating

For the longest time we were trying to find a way to get invited and it just so happens that my husband's coworker's spouse is a magician here. As soon as we walked in it took me to another place, we came with a group of eight and we decided to start the night off with a few drinks and appetizers at the bar. The item that stood out to me would have to be the deviled eggs with truffle oil [too bad it's no longer on the menu]. Throughout the night there were scheduled little magic shows all throughout the castle, we were able to check out each magician until it was time for our dinner reservation. The food was okay, my friends and I shared our entrees so we were able to taste the majority of the dinner entrees. My least favorite would have to be the Beef Wellington, the croissant was a bit soggy for me personally.By the time we were done with dinner it was time for the grand finale magic show which was set in a bigger show room than the other little magic shows. So glad they saved that show for last because it was amazing!

868,3/18/2015,"They have a strict dress ""code""          I finally had the chance to check out the Magic Castle, and I'm so glad I did. It's a beautiful, historic former mansion that was built at the turn of the century and was revamped in the 1960s as a private club for magicians and magic-lovers. The magic shows themselves are kind of hit or miss, depending on the specific performer, but, thankfully, there's a cocktail waitress who makes the rounds while you're waiting to get into each show. (Because everything seems much more magical the more drinks you consume.) The Magic Castle was explained to me as a kind of Disneyland for adults, so you have to wait in line for each performance, but there are also less formal shows happening in the bar and common areas.Also, if you have a chance to speak to the librarian, definitely do! The woman we chatted with had a lot of fascinating information about the history of magic, her own craft (she was a parlor magician who specialized in antique props) and even showed us a trick.The only campy part of the whole experience is the cashier at the foyerservice/service is alrightfood//***while good, don't expect to be wowed...you're here for the showmagic//*****wowzers! so your entry includes an entry to the main show of the night and a dinner scheduled...the rooms throughout the mansion feature different magicians nightlyever act is different...none is the samePLUS~ they select people to be assistants...i was one for the more intimate table rooms....and even up close they were impressive!!   if you'd like to guarantee your return trip...buy your photo taken by their photographers...and it'll provide you with a card and code to redeem for a party of 6",4 star rating

The first room we went into was the smaller auditorium. The magician was labeled a ""Master Magician"" and this guy was really good. I wish I could remember his name but he had the whole act down, entertaining even when not doing magic. The card tricks were amazing! I'm still trying to figure out how the heck he did that stuff. We then went to dinner and the food was surprisingly good. I had a prime rib that was very tasty, the wedge was great w/ ranch dressing. The Thai bisque soup was good as well as the calamari. The final show was in the main room and I recommend dinner that way u are guaranteed seats. This act had more large props and the magic often involved a volunteer. It was a good act and a couple magic tricks really left me scratching my head. If u get a chance I really recommend going to the Magic Castle. Fun time!",5 star rating

We arrived around 7:00pm, just in time to catch a magic show before dinner. He made money disappear then reappear in an orange he had to slice open! For dinner, the prices were pretty steep.. But I didn't expect otherwise. I mean this IS the World Famous (EXCLUSIVE) Magic Castle! After dinner we got our tickets for the main show. Like my classmate and fellow yelper said, it felt more like a comedy show rather than a magic show. We ended the night with two other magic shows but IMO nothing really made me jump out of my seat.

875,7/7/2014,"AT LAST! After years of meaning to go to the Magic Castle, I finally found a reason when my magic-loving best friend was visiting from Australia. Due to scheduling conflicts, we opted for Sunday brunch. I was on board with all of it. The interior is gorgeous. I gleefully said the password to the owl and the bookcase opened. I shouted song requests to Irma, who played a rousing rendition of ""The Maple Leaf Rag"" for me. I snapped loads of photos of the lobby (the only inside space which you're allowed to photograph). I ogled all the Houdini memorabilia. I answered the ringing telephone. I loaded up a couple plates with King Crab legs for Mom, who requested them. And I had a GLORIOUS time, even on no sleep after coming home that morning from Labyrinth Masquerade. If you don't want to wait for smoked salmon, prime rib, and the omelette bar, they've got chicken and waffles ready to go near the owl bar, no waiting. The shows were wonderful, and we got to see Christopher Hart (freaking THING from ""THE ADDAMS FAMILY""!!) do some magic. Earlier, the magician who opened for him pulled my dad up on stage, much to Brandon D.'s and my bemusement. My dad's pretty serious most of the time, and despite shouting, ""No!"" eventually got up as the performer kept grabbing on him. He ended up having a grand time, even when they played the strip tease music as he pulled off his belt for the guy's trick. Kudos to that magician for making my dad loosen up! Off-duty magicians did tricks by the bar, fancily shuffling cards while we ordered our $13 iced rickeys. Yes, it's pricey, and yeah, brunch is loaded with loud, squirmy kids (often times their awe enhances the show), but this was a phenomenal experience. All class all the way.",5 star rating

877,1/23/2015,"I went to the Magic Castle this past Monday (MLK) and had an AMAZING time. I brought along 7 friends (a full party of 8) because I didn't want a single spot to go to waste. When I first called to make the reservations, the girl informed me that they had no openings until late March. I was a little bummed out that I would have to wait so long, but then she said ""oh wait, I have one slot left for Monday at 8PM"" and I jumped right on it. I told my party to 1. meet up early so we could get to the castle early and have time to see as many shows as possible before and after dinner and 2. dress to impress!!! And dress to impress we did. We got to the castle at 6:30PM, I'm really wishing we got there right when doors opened at 5:30. My party was able to see a small close-up act right outside one of the the theatres and did catch a show right before our 8PM dinner. The very first show we saw was with Kozmo in the Parlour of Prestidigitation. Maybe it was because we were all so in awe of just being there, but we all agreed that the first show was our favorite. He borrowed a $20 bill from someone made it disappear and then later made it appear inside of a lemon!! Dinner was ok, nothing spectacular imo. The main show, although good, felt more like a comedic show than a magic show. We caught one last show after the main show with Murray Hatfield. It might have been because we were all starting to wear out (most of us had work the following morning at 6AM), but it didn't wow us as much as the very first show we saw. All in all, my party couldn't stop talking about it (we are still talking about it). Kind of wish we left ourselves more time to explore the castle a bit more and also to check out the close-up acts-1 star was just for dinner. Service was on. We ended up finishing right when the main show was starting because we were waiting on our server to give us our checks and also to get our tickets.

It's definitely out-of-the-ordinary.SHOW:CLOSE-UP GALLERY - enjoyed this although very intimate seating only 20 people.PARLOUR OF PRESTIDIGITATION - small movie theater seating maybe 30-40 people. He definitely WOWed me and my gf by pulling off some magical tricks.PALACE OF MYSTERY - 45min show and we were seated on folded chairs but seats 100+ people. The host was very funny but the main act was boring. I could have passed on the mute with multiple card and ribbon tricks. I'd expect a 45min show to be better than the shorter ones, but that's me. Minus 1 star.HAT & HARE LOUNGE - cool coin tricks but caught the magician a couple of times grabbing things below the bar and in his pocket.FOOD:The deviled eggs were delicious for an appetizer. The warm cinnamon bread was very yummy and I almost wanted to ask for seconds. Maybe I should have. I ordered the herb-crusted red snapper which wasn't good. I don't even remember what my gf ordered because it wasn't memorable. I'm glad I didn't order the shrimp cocktail appetizer because they looked small.DRINKS:Be careful where you order drinks as they change from each area. $11 drinks from waitress on 1st floor, $9 drinks from waiter at bar on 2nd floor. Minus 1 star.Would I return? I'd skip dinner and eat elsewhere and be selective on the magician's the 2nd time around. Maybe stick to the short 20min shows.

880,3/20/2017,"Im divided on this review.... while the experience itself was amazing, Im not sure if the price warrants the experience.  i like the exclusivity of this experience.  You need to have an invitation from a member to attend.  And, I had to look hard to find one.  The dress code is business formal for men and conservative for women.  When we pulled up to the location, it was in hollywood so traffic was difficult but manageable.  Valet is $13 on its own.  Then, there is a long line to get into the place.  While in line, I can tell the dress code only applies to men and not the ladies.  Most ladies (not all) dress up to go to to a nightclub and ready to get down and have fun.  The men (most) dress up for black tie event or an interview.  The establishment will force the men to dress accordingly and buy a tie to get in if you do not wear one. While in line, you have to remember to show your initial invitation.  Although I confirmed this with the Magic Castle establishment on our initial reservation ( of the invitation code from a Magic castle magician), I had to show it again when we get in.  Once you are in, I dont want to spoil anything, the place is rather old school and dingy.  There were alot of guests on a Friday night, and no particular instructions.  The place is small too so  you are going to find yourself bumping into alot of people. The meal was pricey and the portions were amazingly great!  This is one of the better parts of the experience.  But, again, you are seated in a very tight place so were forced to hear these two really loud parties and their loud conversations about things.Now, this establishment serves alcohol and forces alcohol on you.  You are going to find many many drunk people.  This adds to the bumping into people, rowdy crowds during the magic shows.  Due to so many people at the same time, all of the shows are going to be full.  I suggest you wait 30-40 mins in line prior to the show to guarantee seating.  While you are waiting in line, cocktail ladies will come by and push more alcohol to you.  Bottle of Evian water is $4.   The shows are decent and quite exciting.  I would say if you watch alot of magic shows or tricks, (penn and teller), you may figure a few of them out.  And some of the tricks are more rehearsed than others.  I did have a fantastic time meeting the magicians and seeing them perform.  We left around 11:30pm.  Grabbed my car, paid the valet and excited.Overall, the experience was unique as its for my wife's bday.  However, I dont think I am going to come back again.  I prefer a more quiet, and unique ambiance.",1 star rating
881,8/20/2012,"One of my best friends had her birthday at the Magic Castle last night. I read the yelp reviews on the place and steeled myself for a ho-hum mediocre yet expensive night. Little did I realize that I was in for an awesome night!Parking is valet only, $8. I just carpooled with a girlfriend and we split the cost. Entrance fee was $20 per person and they checked all of our i.ds. The lobby was the only place that pictures were permitted.Dinner: Our group of 12 was fortunate enough to dine in the Houdini séance room. The birthday girl called in the morning the day of and asked if we could reserve the séance room and was informed that we could as long as there wasn't a séance being held that night. The room is decorated with tons of Houdini memorabilia, including his very own wand. Our waiter Gustavo was hilarious, engaging, and quite frankly awesome. He told us stories about past séances and brought out some vanilla icecream covered in a dome of chocolate and topped with a candle for the birthday girl. I got the Houdini cut of the prime rib and I found it to be soft and juicy. Gustavo even brought me some fresh horseradish. I thought it was great that I could leave my leftovers with them and pick it up at the end of the night at the lobby.A photographer - who was equally funny - came in to take our picture during dinner. The picture cost $20 cash, $21 card and comes with a pass good for up to eight more guests for a future visit. You pick it up in the lobby.Shows:Since everyone in our group ordered entrees, we all got tickets to the Palace of Mystery show with Dana Daniels and Richard Allen. I laughed so much throughout the show that my face began to hurt. I then teared up like the hormonal pregnant lady that I am when the show wound down with a guy from the audience proposing on stage.We spent some time with Irma since we had difficulty getting seats at the Peller Theatre and Parlour of Prestidigitation. Irma was a delight and definitely worth checking out. I got a yummy virgin bloody mary and was happy to see that restrooms are located near every bar, which is great because I have nighttime morning sickness. Nursing our drinks, we wandered downstairs to the museum and stumbled upon the magician Monty doing a private little show. After him, Crane came in and did a few tricks as well. It was great being able to sit right at the table and watch everything. Monty also explained to us the history behind the word Prestidigitation.The last show we caught was at the Peller Theatre with Paul and Christian. We wound up having to stand throughout the whole show, which was fine because we were mesmerized the whole time.  I'm now wondering if I should encourage my future kid to become a magician instead of the doctor/lawyer/first Asian American president of the America that I know he/she is going to be just so that I can get passes whenever to the Magic Castle.",5 star rating
882,3/19/2015,"This is one of the 10 wonders of Los Angeles.  If you like magic, this is where you can see it in its best form.  It's also a great opportunity to wear that ball gown you never get a chance to wear or that tuxedo that's gathering dust in your closet.  This is a night you'll never forget.I know because I'm a pro magician.  I'm also a longtime member of the Castle, which is a private club.The best way to get into this place is to find a magician and request a pass.  Then hire the magician at your next party.  See, if you get the magician on your side, you can ask his advice on which is the best week to attend, because it really does matter.  The quality of the shows varies from week to week.  Once in there, ask the hosts which show is the can't-miss show that week.  You must also check out the Museum and the Hat & Hare Pub, where fabulous magicians perform unannounced.  I've caught some really great names down there, often names that are better than the names who are performing scheduled shows in the rooms!",5 star rating

885,8/10/2012,"I seriously enjoy going to these exclusive places. You can only enter by invitation or having a membership. I've never heard of this place until most recently by my gf. This place is a mansion that has a president by the name of Neil Patrick Harris. When you arrive in front you have to pay $8 for valet parking. You then enter as you had them your guest pass. You are required to pay $20 a person to enter. They notify you in front that you cannot bring in cameras or use your cell phones. Don't forget if you are a male come in a suit and if you're a female come in a fancy dress. The rules are strict and you will be turned away if you don't follow instructions.Once you enter there are a bunch of bars all over the place to order drinks. They also have a schedule of where you can watch many different magician's perform. There is a main room for the main act and performs about 3 times a night. The shows are fun and if you enjoy magic you'll get a kick out of the shows. For the food, it's so-so. For my entree I ordered the filet of beef 6oz. It came with steamed veggies, mashed potatoes, and a dipping sauce for the steak. I ordered it medium rare and it came correct. The food isn't the greatest but you HAVE to order an entree if you go here. I also got the garlic cheese bread as my appetizer. It was filling with tons of garlic and cheese. Good stuff. Don't expect the best food because you will be disappointed. Come and enjoy the experience and just soak it all in..",4 star rating
886,10/23/2016,"I was super excited to celebrate my 30th bday here. All my friends and I are all glam up for the night and everyone already anticipated spending some bills that night (13 for valet-not bad,$30-for door charge and atleast $50 for one entree and $15 for cocktail) but man..for something this fancy,their food was BLUNT. Super mediocre,the tomahawk for $70 was a waste,their Filet Mignon was a cheap kind of meat. So disappointed. One of my friends even returned her order. Management should know and put an action to this specially if ur charging that much. Would not go back here for food. Not worth it.",1 star rating
887,3/6/2017,"I love the exclusivity of this place and how they make you stick to a dress code. It maintains the atmosphere and magic of this place. The magicians are always amazing. My personal favorite is the close up room, but you have to get in line early to get in since it's a very small room and fills up quickly. The rest of the rooms you can usually get into easily. The drinks are a bit over priced and the food is only ok, so I wouldn't recommend coming for dinner if you can avoid it. Come for the shows and the atmosphere and to be in one of the only places lest where magic still lives.",4 star rating
888,4/20/2017,The manager Gerrardo was extremely rude. He was acting hostile and aggressive because one of the staff members showed me the wrong door for the smoking section. For an establishment like magic castle it is sad to see such unprofessionalism​ from their staff.,1 star rating
889,11/10/2018,It's unfortunate I cannot separate my rating into two categories: Magic experience and food experience. The former deserves 5 stars and the latter 2 stars. The magic shows and card tables were worth every penny. The magicians are incredible as well as humorous. The food on the other hand leaves much to be desired. My chicken was rubbery and tasted like someone had swiped a brush full of hot sauce across it. The vegetables were an over cooked heap of broccoli and something unrecognizable. My husband's salmon was completely ordinary. My daughter enjoyed her sea bass though it appeared to be lacking some of the vegetables. It is a pricey menu. I expected much better. That said the service was good,3 star rating
890,3/25/2016,My husband and I were invited! Finally yay! I was so excited when I got the news! When we arrived we were greeted and valet took our car.

We went into the castle and had an amazing time! I will not spoil it for others with more details but so much fun! If you ever get to go cherish the experience! I hope to go again one day! Thank you!,5 star rating
891,11/15/2012,"I think people who have negative reviews about this place have their expectations too high.  Like they think the magic is going to transport them to some alien world and their mind will be blown.Lighten up guys!  This place is awesome!  It's like a series of different rooms and when you get to the next room, there's a bar!  Of course you need another drink!  If not at the bar, than get one when they're taking drink orders right before a show.  Obviously if you didn't have fun, you need to take a chill pill and have a drink.I think the magic shows were hilarious...it's not mind blowing Harry-Houdini-shit.  It's decent magic tricks that you may or may not have seen before and don't bother trying to figure out how it's done cause that spoils the fun!  Plus, where else can you get drunk and then watch a magic show?!  Also, they (tastefully) use adult humor and innuendo which I really liked (and I'm hard to impress with that, I normally think that stuff is for immature 23 year old boys who still don't know how to do laundry properly)!I went during their Halloween celebrations and it was fantastic.  Everyone was really decked out in costume, I can't imagine going any other time in normal clothes.The food at the restaurant gets five stars.  My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti which I though ""really? you're getting spaghetti?  But it was the BEST spaghetti I've ever had.  And I got the Houdini cut of the prime rib, which was very good and I still couldn't finish the smaller portion.  Our waiter was great.If you didn't know already, you can get a guest pass to Magic Castle without knowing anyone who is a member!  Simply stay at the very wonderful Magic Castle Hotel (highly recommended, best customer service EVER) and you'll get a guest pass to the Castle.  They'll even shuttle you back and forth for free.  I recommend drinking the night away at the Castle, then retreat back to the hotel in the wee morning hours. :)",5 star rating

Our friend is a member and invited us for a night of magic, and magical it was indeed!  We were expecting just dinner and a magic show, but came to find out, it's like a small amusement ""park"" with many different rooms and areas for different shows and activities.  The show rooms are generally small, creating a very intimate and fun experience.  We even got to participate in a couple of them!  The food was also amazing; those garlic cheese bread..YUM!!! I had the filet and other people in our party had the lamb, sea bass, and it all looked very tasty.  The desserts were also delicious.  It was so much fun, I can't wait to go back!",5 star rating
893,10/17/2016,"I went to the Magic Castle yesterday (Oct.16.2006). Thanks to my sister in law's boyfriend connection. They covered our entrance fee, but I would have never agreed to go if I knew dinner & drinks would cost me over $300 dollars. My main complaint is the shows were below average. I was expecting performances to be Vegas status. I think they hyped up this place just because it's exclusive. You are not missing out! Do not come here!",1 star rating
894,6/11/2012,"The Magic Castle is a sprawling French-style mansion with secret passageways, hidden rooms, and theatres where you can experience magic in all its forms. Whether it's catching a show or asking a passing magician for an impromptu performance, this place is the real life Hogwarts without all the dark magic Voldemort nonsense. The interior reminded me of old-school Las Vegas before the resort takeover in the 1990s. You know, the old Vegas sans second-hand smoke where the interior of the casinos had red carpets, intricate wall décor, and dim lighting. Little details like the sliding bookcase where the owl provides you access to the Magic Castle when you say the secret phrase to the intricate stained glass windows by the library added a rustic, old-school charm. In my opinion, the true magic of Magic Castle besides the fact that it has withstood the test of time is that the minute you enter, you are transported into a bygone era where people dressed up to go out (no rhinestone studded shirts or moose knuckle jeans allowed), where bars had no televisions, and where people got to know people in person and not through their damn smart phones. But who am I kidding? The real magic is the magic, stupid! And of course the fact that NPH (Neil Patrick Harris), wait for it, happens to be the president is an added nugget of awesomeness. Maybe Harold and Kumar should have gone to the Magic Castle... I'm not going to give away all the secrets of the Magic Castle, but to get into the ""most unusual private club in the world"" you need to be a member or be a guest of a member (thank you J. Tang). If you can gain access, you will be privy to magic the way it should have always been. None of that outdated 1980s crap that droopy-faced Lance Burton was selling at the Monte Carlo for the last 30 years before he thankfully retired. Seriously, watching magic up close and personal is what it's all about at the Magic Castle and the intimacy of each theatre provides that. Also, I think this was one of the only times in my life that I was actually delighted to be deceived and toyed with. I mean when else am I going to be called the ""gentleman that looks bored as shit"" by Close-up Magician of the Year, Derek DelGaudio? While the food looked and smelled pretty good, I didn't get a chance to eat any because I had eaten earlier and was busy drinking draft beer ($7). While Magic Castle has multiple full bars, being a beer addict, I was more focused on their beer selection which consists of Firestone, Stella, and Blue Moon on draft and various bottled beers.  Magic Castle is definitely a place that I would love to return to. Magic is an art that needs to be supported because in this digital age, the arts are being lost to iPads and iPhones creating iMorons. Or what magician Paul Green referred to as products of public education. After all, no app in the world could ever replace the once in a lifetime experience you will have at the Magic Castle. Five stars for a wonderful experience that was capped off by Guimarães and DelGaudio blowing my fucking mind. Like seriously, how'd they do that? * Despite being a straight married man, I have to admit that many of the male assistants and staff had to be some of the best looking men I've ever seen. Particularly the guy with the awesome hair that was working the Close-Up Gallery when Paul Green was performing.* BTW I wasn't bored, Mr. DelGaudio, I was just focusing really hard. I like to call it my American Psycho fuck face.* Oh yea, I adored Helder Guimarães (Parlour Magician of the Year) and his Portuguese-accented English... especially when he said that he was ""shuffling the cards like a puppy.""* Firestone beer is only available at the bar by the Close-Up Gallery.-------------------Shout outs to the people in our group that made the experience memorable: Nelson, Laura, Ethan, JMLA, May, Esther, Tiffany, Jasper, JT, and of course, my wife.",5 star rating
895,7/23/2013,"Ever since I moved to LA, I've always wanted to go to the Magic Castle.  The main hurdle obviously is knowing a member, and I just didn't know anyone!  Finally, after over 10 years, when all hope was lost, a friend of a friend invited us.  By this point, I'm thinking it won't live up to what I imagined it would be.  The day arrives and heading to Hollywood from the west side is a nightmare on a Thursday.  I wanted to pull my hair out and almost turned around and went back home.  But we prevailed!  It.  Was.  Awesome.  Seriously, I've never had more fun and I was up way past my normal bedtime of 9:30 p.m. on a week night.  The member we were with helped us time when to get in line, what shows to try and catch, etc.  It was very helpful going with a member too since he gave us a bit more history on the castle.  I have to say that out of all the acts I saw, I really like the up close and personal ones.  My very first magic show was in the bar area downstairs with Gregory Wilson.  It was in between his sets and we nabbed the bar seats aka front row so we can order food and drinks while we wait for the show to start.  He was so awesome and still performed magic tricks.  He was amazing and I think ruined me for the rest of the evening b/c no one else compared.  I hope to go back again and I really want to see more of Gregory Wilson!",5 star rating

First off this place has a ton of bars which is awesome also has a lot of bartenders which is totally thank god, because if Dwight had been the only bartender there this night would have sucked.  I have never seen a more clueless slow bartender ever I felt so sad for the bartender who had to work with him, If I had been that guy I would have quit.Luckily after that disaster I ordered my next drink from the bar by Irma and Manny was very nice and quick and poured quite a tasty drink.Overall I feel so blessed to get to go and I had a blast minus the Dwight part",3 star rating

899,6/29/2014,"If you can get into Magic Castle, you will have an amazing time and I highly recommend checking it out. I was lucky enough to be on one of the magician's guest lists so I didn't have to pay any cover. Furthermore, since I took a Sidecar trip here, I didn't have to pay any valet fees ($13). There are a couple things I really wish I knew before I went here:1) You MUST be dressed up in a suit. I am talking slacks, jacket, tie, and appropriate shoes. I drove up form San Diego and didn't bring a suit so I had to borrow one from someone. Even though I had a suit on, I was wearing some boat shoes with my suit and they told me I couldn't enter with them. I had to walk down to H&M and waste money on a pair of cheap $30 shoes. This incidence caused me to, unfortunately, give Magic Castle 1 star. Please read on for more detail.2)  Plan to stay from 5:00PM to about 11:00PM to get a full experience. I got in around 6:00PM and was able to catch about 3 shows before I had to head out around 9:45PM. I wish I stayed later so I could've caught the main room show.3) If you don't have dinner here, you won't have priority for show seating so it's best you wait in line up to 30 minutes before a show starts. This becomes more important as the night progresses.Now for the 1-star justification:I want to give Magic Castle 5 stars because the experience was fabulous, but I can't give 5/5 because that's reserved for a true perfect 10 out of 10 (The French Laundry and Jiro Ono type places). I technically want to give 4.5 stars but can't since we're only working with integers here.So as I was standing in line to get in, my group second in line behind another group, the door person says something to the people in front of us along the lines of ""that guy behind you is wearing boat shoes and can't get in."" Initially I wasn't sure what she meant or if she was serious so I just waited and didn't clarify what she said to the other group. TEN minutes later, when I am next up, she rudely tells me I can't get in because I am wearing boat shoes. What? You made me wait TEN minutes when you couldn't just told me when you noticed earlier? Is it because I don't look rich/LA enough? Fine, I understand it's policy, but why waste TEN minutes of my time especially after vocalizing it to a group in front of me. Earlier I saw another guy with boat shoes (didn't know if he was before or after me in line) and was certain he couldn't get in either. So then I went down onto Hollywood Boulevard to grab a pair of cheap shoes from H&M. I walk back and happily walk inside. This time the door person (which happened to be the manager) didn't even look at my shoes and let me in. Alright, whatever, we were in and we didn't have to pay anything just looking to have a good time, which we absolutely did.After seeing a couple shows and walking around, guess what I see, the other guy (who was Caucasian) wearing boat shoes who wasn't turned away to waste money on cheap shoes down the street. This was unfair treatment and I felt very marginalized by that rude African American lady.To end this story, just wear a nice suit and you'll be fine. Don't try to bend the rules and you won't have that rude/nasty African-American lady marginalize you. It's too bad racism/classism still exists in this world. Avoid her if you can if you want a better experience at Magic Castle.",1 star rating
900,3/1/2015,Everyone should come here at least once! I came here for NYE and it was my favorite NYE yet. It's a castle located behind the chaos of Hollywood Blvd. and you walk from room to room watching magic shows. The better magicians fill up quickly so make sure to get in line at least 30 minutes (or longer!) before the show starts. There are several bars and the bartenders also do magic tricks! Everyone is really good. There is a dance floor where they had the countdown and they filled the place with balloons and champagne. You do have to know a member and dress super fancy.

We split the enormous ribeye special and added a baby lobster tail for a well presented and delicious main course. Perfectly cooked baked potato put the final spell of good flavor on our tummies.

907,10/29/2014,"This review is for  Saturday afternoon visit which is more casual (no jeans) and family friendly.  The castle is actually a  mansion  built in the early 1900s and has been the home of the Academy of Magical Arts since 1963.    I'm really not into magic but  tagged along with a friend.  There were some cutesy things like you have to say a secret phrase to the owl in order to get inside the castle and there is a ghost that plays the piano.  I don't know if there is a tour but I think it would be interesting to learn more about the mansion.  The main show is in the Palace of Mystery and lasts around 45 minutes.  There are other shows at the smaller theaters and even at the bar.We had the brunch which was a bit on the smallish side but they did have mimosas, crab legs and an omelette bar (my friend said the eclairs were to die for).  We did see a certain blonde A-list celebrity and her family enjoying the buffet and checking out the shows after.  Our server wasn't very good but he was very lively.Because it was a weekend when kids are allowed the shows were more kid friendly (there were some kid magicians performing too).  The magician at the main show was  Eric Buss who combined comedy (reminded me of Jim Carrey) with his magic.  He was entertaining as was the emcee.  I understand the evening shows feature more top notch magicians and the atmosphere is a lot more sophisticated in the evenings.Cost: $13 +tip -valet, $20 cover charge, $40 brunch",3 star rating
908,7/9/2016,"We just for out of this place. I was super excited and stoked because we were invited exclusively by my husbands friend. I know not just anyone can buy tickets and go. When we made the reservations the lady in the phone never mentioned that there was an entrance fee and on top of that we had to pay the most expensive brunch I've ever had for omelettes, waffles, bacon, eggs, ice cream, salads and breakfast potatoes. I would have been ok to pay for the brunch and show which was $39.95 per adult and $19.95 per child. Instead we were charged $20 per person just to walk in to the castle. That was $80 plus $13 for valet it was a total $93. Then we were told  Togo up stairs to meet our waiter. We were seated at our table and we ate maybe $ 60 worth of food because our first show was at 11:15am,  we were charged $152.61 just for food plus tip. At this point I am thinking ok we got charge this much, the shows must be that good. NOPE!!!! they were card tricks, a guy putting shoes on his nose and holding them for 7 secs. And a lady that looked like Hilary Clinton making rope tricks, a salt trick and money trick. I mean for the almost $300 I pay for I was expecting greatness but instead we got a circus act with some street magic shows. If it's your first time there, it's confusing to know where to go. We had to ask the waiter or other guest where to go for stuff. The bathrooms were in the first floor and most of all the shows are in the second floor so if you had to go to the restroom chances are you're gonna miss part of a show. Also for what you're paying to get in, I expected better seating. Nooooooo!! Each room has maybe 20 seats, everyone else has to stand on the stairs or wait for the next show. Would I go again? Maybe not, my kids were bored, my husband was bored and I was just so disappointed that so many wonderful things have been said about this place but yet it failed to deliver what the hype is about. The only 2 great experiences about this place is the friendly ghost Irma. She plays almost any song known to mankind. All you gotta do is say, ""hey Irma can you play this ...... ( say the name of the song you want) and she will play it. She was awesome and her invisible bird is right by her in its cage! The second thing is that the brunch shows do leave the first 2 rows for the children so they can see and participate in the acts.",2 star rating

My server Gustavo helped make my birthday incredible and the food was worth every penny. The less you know going into it, the better. No pictures whatsoever, very elegant. If you ever get the chance to dine here, take it! I can't wait to go back. Also, at the magic show I saw, I sat a row behind Jason Alexander (George Costanza from Seinfeld). I died a little.",5 star rating
910,11/10/2014,"I absolutely adore this place, but you need to know a member to get in. Yes, that means magicians. It's such an out of the norm night out in Los Angeles. You'll need dust off a suit and tie to get past the door and put away your cell phone, but once that happens, you're in for a treat. Find a knight for a tour, seek out Irma and grab a bite so you can get tickets to the main show. Definitely ask questions from those who know and get the scoop. It's a rich history and it seems that everyone in Hollywood was a magician. The food is OK although overpriced, but if you stick with lobster tail and filet mignon, you'll be fine. Also, if you can book the Houdini room for dinner (seats 12) it's pretty amazing. I mean who wouldn't want to be known as the King of Cuffs.",5 star rating
911,5/17/2013,"I finally had the chance to check out the Magic Castle, and I'm so glad I did. It's a beautiful, historic former mansion that was built at the turn of the century and was revamped in the 1960s as a private club for magicians and magic-lovers. The magic shows themselves are kind of hit or miss, depending on the specific performer, but, thankfully, there's a cocktail waitress who makes the rounds while you're waiting to get into each show. (Because everything seems much more magical the more drinks you consume.) The Magic Castle was explained to me as a kind of Disneyland for adults, so you have to wait in line for each performance, but there are also less formal shows happening in the bar and common areas.Also, if you have a chance to speak to the librarian, definitely do! The woman we chatted with had a lot of fascinating information about the history of magic, her own craft (she was a parlor magician who specialized in antique props) and even showed us a trick. Minus one star because I would love to return for just a drink at the bar, but the admission policy will never allow that!",4 star rating
912,7/3/2016,"I think you appreciate anything in life you have to work hard for, so this was something I really enjoyed, from the start of getting a coveted ticket, to having Yelp friends enjoy the opportunity to experience the Magic Castle.  My work friend was a magician and presented me with a ticket for 8.  I held onto it for several years, not knowing the process and who would want to go.  It just so happened I found out many of my Yelp friends wanted to go, so here we are.  The club is very exclusive, and a Hollywood landmark, with an impressive list of former and current Magicians.  Try to get there early for the parlor magic, as it is entertaining and up close.  Expect much of it to be comedy as well, since we want to be entertained both before and after the ""Magic"".  Dinner was a seating party of 8, and we managed to get one more in through some creative and subtle tricks of our own.  The meals were similar to a Lawry'sesque cuisine, but you should know to order table bread, because they don't automatically bring it out.  Many had the Beef Wellington, which seemed okay, but the pork chops were my favorite dish, as the meat was done just right, and the accompaniment was delicious.  At the end of dinner, you get a ticket to see the main show, which was pretty good.  I'd say the whole night was entertaining, with both the company and the Magicians.  I hope to come back, now armed with a little bit more knowledge, and maybe get there early and stay latter to get the whole effect.  Thanks Nadine for gathering us, and my son really had a great time as well!",4 star rating

My girlfriend and I were each required to get an entree as part of the reservation. So, I got the miso glazed seabass and she got the 10oz Cajun style prime rib with a side of mushrooms.

920,7/21/2016,"My time at the Magic-less Castle was definitively one of the worst experiences of my life.If LA is the city of illusions & pretense than the Magic Castle is the ultimate representation of it with very little to no substance.The gatekeepers work profusely to give you the perception that you're so fortunate to have been selected to enter the doors of the castle. There's the typical pretentious dress code and the case of exclusivity is hammered into you. ""You are an invited guest. What a privilege!"" Despite the fact you're an ""invited"" guest, there is an $30 entrance fee and dining at the overpriced restaurant is mandatory. The food much  like the ""magic"" is mediocre. Though the castle has the overall feel of a castle, it just seems rundown and in desperate need of remodeling. I never quite experienced the Victorian elegance that is advertised on the website. I did come to realize that the secret is that the magic bit of it is a complete scam.The entire night I kept waiting to see just one magic trick that would blow my mind or at the very least impress, but unfortunately every show fell flat. Instead of magicians, the evening was jammed pack with mediocre actors pretending to be magicians. The premise of several of the shows were magicians who couldn't perform magic tricks on the first or even second try. What an utter disappointment. Please save your time, energy, money and expectations for something else.",1 star rating
921,7/29/2012,This place is an invite only joint. So if you're lucky to get invited go check out the place and try to see as many shows inside the Magic Castle.I would recommend NOT going on a weekend as I did because there is an influx of people who go which means less time for you to see more shows. I went on a Friday night and it was packed to the rims and we only got into 2 rooms and many walk through common areas displaying magic tricks.I'd like to go back and check out the big show in the main theater with the magic trick I heard that deals with fire!,4 star rating

928,5/7/2014,"Avoid this tourist trap! Please understand that I have no problem spending, but when I do, I expect quality. This was probably the worst dining/entertainment evening I've ever experienced. The show was comparable to the free shows your offered in Vegas. I'm a Los Angeles native and let me tell you there are much better places to spend your evening. Avoid this Hollywood cliché and go to a business that appreciates your business, as THIS PLACE DOES NOT. I was treated very poorly because I am not a ""member"". However, from what I saw this place is cutting a lot of corners, a sure sign that an establishment is hurting. I'm not sure how much the member's dues are, but at $150 per head, I would say that visitors contribute quite a bit as well. Positives-- Gorgeous castle Friendly valet (be sure to tip valet DIRECTLY at the end of the night) Friendly server Negatives-- Buffet level food with few options -- nothing innovative Slow service.-- 1 hour 45 minutes Watered down drinks -- no garnishes -- $12 Disappointing show and even worse customer service - Attended 20 minutes of a 45-minute show before it got cancelled due to an audience member emergency. No magic. 20 min show- 17 min stuck in main room while emergency was handled- exited 8 minutes prior to what would have been the end of show. When you pay nearly $150 per person for a main show, this is a bit disappointing. Sideshows were backed up (more than likely from the main show being let out early) Regardless, by the end of the night I saw one card trick. It wasn't a very magical night. Snooty staff and management -- rude and condescending.  It would have cost the Magic Castle nothing to invite me back for a main show and witness some ""magic"". Sooo disappointing!",1 star rating
929,7/6/2014,"A unique experience.  My first event was for an evening visit.  Cocktail attire.  It was only $25 to enter, but the dinner is overpriced for what it is, and that is where they get you.  And you have to order an entree. I usually get a bunch of appetizers as my meal, so that was disappointing.  Also strange was the fact that they never brought bread to the table.  When I asked, they brought sweet rolls.  Didn't really go with the food.   But the service was good and very friendly.  But you don't really come here to eat, so plan your night accordingly and get in line for the several shows on the schedule.  We managed to get to all three as well as spend some time with Irma, the piano ghost and wander around with cocktails.  We were the guest of a magician, so we got the full tour with historical backgrounds, and a special show from him all to ourselves.  So I can't complain for my first visit. My second visit was for Sunday brunch.  $20 to enter and $40 for brunch. Their are several brunch seatings.  The  lines get crazy for the food, so its best to get to your seating early and fill up your plate.   Crab legs are offered so you get your $40 worth if you eat up on those.  Also had ahi tuna sashimi, prime rib, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, omelette bar, and the usual brunch items like eggs, etc.  The upside of Sunday afternoon is it appears to be less crowded but we didn't see the random magician sitting in bar area and its family time, so there are a lot of kids and front rows are reserved for all kids.  I am the height of a kid but get shoved to the back, so I am shit out of luck.  It makes for a very nice experience.  Not something I would do on a regular basis, but a great thing to do with a group of people for a special occasion.  The magicians are quite talented.",4 star rating
930,5/5/2014,"We went to the Magic Castle on a Sunday evening. We had dinner reservations that were made months ahead of time for 6pm, so we arrived a bit before 6. It was a good thing we came early because there was a line formed outside the entrance of the Castle. There is a security guard managing the line, allowing people to enter by party. He checked IDs before we entered (21+ only), so make sure to have that on hand. He informed us that pictures were allowed outside of the Castle and in the lobby, but anywhere else, pictures weren't allowed. Kind of a bummer, but I think they keep this strict rule to keep the Castle as exclusive as possible (I also heard magicians exchange trade secrets within the Castle so pictures are not allowed). They have a strict dress code policy which you can find on their website-- basically men have to wear suits and women wear dresses and heels.When you enter the doors, you're standing in a very small lobby that looks like a library. To the right is an incredibly small gift shop that is extremely unappealing. I was looking forward to getting a souvenir, but all the small selection of items items for sale were... interesting. Unfortunately, there is an entrance fee for people who aren't members or VIP guests. The entrance fee is $30. You can also pay for parking at the same time you purchase your ticket. After getting your ticket, you're told to say ""open sesame"" to an owl sitting on a bookshelf. The bookshelf opens and leads you to the rest of the Castle.Dinner at the Magic Castle was pretty good. Make sure to bring a good wad of cash if you want to eat well. The fried calamari appetizer was okay, I definitely had better elsewhere. The cheesy bread was so good- it was like cheese pizza. The truffle fries were inexpensive and plentiful. **TIP** They won't give you a bread basket unless you ask for it since they want you to buy appetizers. Just ask and they'll bring it to you (their bread was so good!)For my main course, I ordered one of their specials for the night. It was steak with crab meat and asparagus and other mixed vegetables. It was $40, which wasn't too bad, but I wish it came in a bigger serving. There was hardly any crab meat, but the sauce it came with was awesome. For dessert, I got to try the creme brûlée. All their desserts are $10 and they have a small selections of chocolate mousse, creme brûlée, ice cream, and a couple more items.The service was good. The waiter always took the orders and served the ladies first. I thought that was so cool since very few places do that. If you have dinner reservations, you get reserved seating for one of the shows. Very convenient since every show fills up fast.On this particular night, we watched Rudy Coby's Magic vs. Science. I was expecting a traditional magic show, but what I saw was the complete opposite. It was a strange show, with slapstick comedy and no real ""magic"" that made you puzzled or amazed. I was disappointed, to be honest. Magic Castle has such an amazing reputation for great magic, but you couldn't tell from watching this show. Rudy Coby performs a lot at events like EDC, so his magic is a trip. Not my cup of tea.Luckily, there are magicians doing magic all over the castle--some magicians who are visiting the Castle will stop at a table and randomly do magic for other guests. My favorite magician I saw that night was Timo Mark from Germany. He was very entertaining and his magic was great! I also watched another magician (don't know his name) at the downstairs bar where you can sit at the bar and have magic done right in front of you. That place was full really early, so I watched from the outskirts of the bar. He did a lot of coin tricks that were really cool. I guess I'm into the traditional tricks like coins, cards and bunnies in top hats. This one particular lady who worked at the Castle collecting tickets for one of the shows was extremely rude to our party. We entered the theater and set our belongings on our seats since we had to use the bathroom. The 2 men took off their coats and headed to the bathroom. This lady was SO rude in saying they needed to put their coats on even if it was going to the bathroom. She literally said, ""you can leave the Castle if you don't like the dress code policy."" She said all of this before the men could even agree to go back and get their coats. She assumed they didn't care for the dress code when the truth was they just didn't know they needed it to use the urinal for a minute. Overall, the Magic Castle is an experience all should have. I don't know if I'd want to visit again because I was a bit let down on my first visit. I also noticed that the people here are mostly rich, stuck up people, which I don't blend well with. I'm glad I got to finally experience the Magic Castle, though. As for the magic, the magic show I watched at Knotts Berry Farm was better.",3 star rating

Born and raised in LA (YES, we're the rare ones in tourist-central Hollywood among all the LA transplants, but we exist), I've always heard about the exclusive Magic Castle. There's nothing in LA that's quite like it. It's an establishment built solely upon magician and magic enthusiasts.  Types of Magic at the castle:- Close up magic -- includes, but not limited to: card tricks, coins, and ropes.There are theatres for close-up magic, and it's amazing to experience because it's so up close and personal.- Stage Magic -- acts change all the time. I've seen the classic lady being sawed in half, to Comedy stand-up magic, to even spiritual demon dance magic O____o..- Bar Magic -- probably my favorite because the bar setting is both relaxed and intimate at the same time. Bartenders take your drink orders and are fabulous magicians on the side.- IRMA.. the invisible piano player, request a song, any song. And she will play, don't forget to tip in the bird cage.There are a lot of secret passage ways to find more associate magicians along the way, so this castle is literally filled with magicians, every nook and cranny  Inside, the castle gives an old Hollywood feeling, cocktail attire for ladies and men have to wear suits. ...GUYS, I'm talking about your jacket needs be either on you or on your lady friend at all times or a security guard will kindly tap your shoulder to remind you to put your jacket on.Thanks to JY, I'm Magic Castle'd out and got to experience this place tons of times.

Spicy and lost all connection to the vegetable its named after.The so called Beef Wilmington was an abstract representation of that dish, served with soggy dough and undercooked meet. surrounded by exhausted vegetables presented Norm like on the plate but asking for triple the price.My only suggestion is to have a chef cook the food or at least check it instead of a an overextended cook.As long and you don't eat there, you can have a pleasant experience, if you can suspend your disbelief long enough.",2 star rating

I also had hand made shoes made by a local shoemaker to the stars. My car was parked in the very front in the VIP space next to the door. My wife was wearing a twenty thousand plus dollar outfit with a matching Hermes handbag and a seven caret engagement ring set in platinum. The event was my best friends birthday (who was my best man) and he was wearing black denim jeans.The staff were fronted by an obviously demented desk girl with an unnerving knife between her teeth attitude and the manager who was called to referee the preposterous situation then actually asked to see the mfg label so as to ascertain as to whether there was any denim in the fabric ingredients...

My favorite magic show was the one with bartender Mike in the dungeon. In terms of food, the dinner was very expensive and not worth the $, but I guess it's to be expected. I got the lobster special, which was two lobster tails with mashed potatoes and vegetables for $40. I actually liked mine, but the beef wellington was disappointing.

941,11/15/2012,"It's a phrase universally known, but so cliche. The words roll out of your mouth foolishly...""Open Sesame""You spit the phrase under your breath at a dirty bronze owl. A bookcase slides open and you enter what appears to be the parlor of a 1930s speakeasy. There's a bit of the old glamour of Hollywood in here. Patrons enjoy their libations at the bar, exuding the essence of Errol Flynn and Jean Harlowe. A tuxedo would not be out of place here. Dapper men in saddleshoes and pinstripes fan cards between their fingers, exhibiting nimbleness and dexterity far beyond this novice's skills. Magic is being practiced here. The Magic Castle is an institution unique to Los Angeles. It is an invitation only, dinner and show presented both by paid entertainers and by member aficionados of the magical arts. I will say, while dinner is a required part of the experience, it is not memorable in any way other than cost. The experience here is the show.I spent a birthday evening here, watching the main stage show, which was entertaining but heavily prop laden, watching an up-close sleight of hand card show, and watching amateurs practice their hobby in the bowels of the Magic Castle. The sleight of hand work was the most amazing, but the non-professionals were the most fun to watch. There are bars on nearly every floor, within close proximity to each room or stage where shows are presented. Even the bartenders practice magic. I highly recommend that you take advantage of this service while you are at the Magic Castle. It makes suspension of disbelief that much easier.Keep your cameras, phones and skepticism in check.

Risotto was overcooked, Lamb chops looked delicious but lacked seasoning. Friend's filet mignon (two of them) came out cold, macaroni and cheese not flavorful from what they said, but it looked amazing. From our party those who enjoyed their entrees were the ones that ordered the Chicken, or prime rib if I am not mistaken. Drinks? Great! :)  If they don't know a drink they will google it and make an effort to make it for you.Manager? Daniel or Danny was very nice and friendly.  He stood with us a while and engaged in converstaion.Magic Castle Hotel? Basic, but it was convienent, and the shuttle will take you back and forth.  The older gentleman was kind on the way to the Magic Castle, but the younger gentleman on way back was very disrespectful.

I must say the food was just OK, and the headliner magicians left something to be desired!The four stars is for the magicians doing table magic that were so amazing! They made our night!

946,7/25/2012,"Hidden among the trees of the narrow but insanely busy Franklin Avenue sits the world famous home to the Academy of Magical Arts -- The Magic Castle. I've always wanted to experience the Magic Castle, however it's a private club that is members or member's guests only. The stories I've heard about this legendary place have made it near the top of my ""Must Do"" list for quite some time. Fortunately, I was able to take part in the magic when a family friend invited us to see him perform (Handsome Jack).The Magic Castle is at the top of a very steep driveway in the Hollywood Hills. After you valet your car you're led into the lobby area. There is a small gift shop and a counter with the hostesses waiting to greet you. After checking in you go through a secret door in the bookcase that can only be opened when the secret word is whispered to the owl statue on one of the shelves.The inside is very small and jam packed full of people. There are multiple bars with huge crowds of people hovering around them. As you make your way up the stairs, you get to the restaurant. After elbowing our way through tons more people, we gave the host our reservation name and were immediately led to our table.The dining room is very dressy and upscale (especially since the dress code is a STRICT suit and tie required for men and classy evening wear for women). The Victorian accents make it feel as if you've been sent back in time to the days of Harry Houdini. There is plenty of vintage magician posters lining the walls, so I definitely recommend wandering through the halls to see them.The dinner menu has the classy American favorites with seafood, steak, and plenty of appetizers and soups. Also note, you're given a free ticket to the special show of the night if you have dinner at the castle. Our server said it's the only ticket required show in the castle. To start things off right, I got the tuna tartare. It came in a cylinder shape with some homemade chips to scoop the delicious raw tuna. I would say it was one of the best tuna tartares that I've had.For my entree I got the seabass (with artichoke hearts, Parmesan risotto, and tomato). It was a large filet of fish seared perfectly. The meat was tender and flaky with the right amount of juiciness. The Parmesan risotto was absolutely amazing. I was sad it was only a small portion because I loved every bite! And of course, who couldn't love tender artichoke hearts.For dessert, we got the lava cake (with vanilla bean ice cream) to share. It was extremely rich but the calorie intake was completely worth it. The vanilla bean ice cream balanced the ultra rich chocolate, too.The best part of the Magic Castle, in my opinion, is that after dinner you still have plenty of magic shows to see. There are multiple rooms all showing a different professional magician. The concept of ""dinner and a show"" is somewhat lost in LA, but the Magic Castle pulls it off perfectly. It's an experience of a lifetime that you can truly never get anywhere else. And yes, I've gone this long without mentioning it, but it's like a real-life Hogwarts. If you're ever given the opportunity to visit this magical place (literally), DO NOT PASS IT UP! Five stars for sure!",5 star rating
947,1/11/2015,"We went on a Saturday night, it was mobbed. We started out trying to squeeze under a too small canopy to avoid a drenching rain for the long wait to get in the doors. We were in a large group and did have our own dining area. I had the salmon, which came with grilled veggies. The food was delicious, the salmon moist and nicely flavored. The grilled veggies were perfection as well. The cheesecake dessert was definitely to die for. Fortunately, the serving size was reasonable, enough to enjoy, could have easily eaten twice as much, could have easily put on a lot of extra fat. So it was a perfectly sized serving.The bad, drinks. A very thin glass of house champagne and a margarita were $26, so $30 with tip. We had a second round during the following dinner show, $24 for a small whiskey and soda and a small rum and coke. So $28 with tip for 2 more drinks. Almost $60 for two people having two drinks each. The rum and coke was very good, but it was about 1 ounce of rum, 2 ounces of coke, and 4 ounces of ice cubes. That's a lot of money for 4 sips of a drink. It was our first time there, and we had no idea of what to do, of trying to fit in shows when you could barely walk around due to the mob scene. No one on staff was very helpful in giving tips or hints as to which way to go. In 5 hours, we had dinner and saw two short magic shows. The main show was 45 minutes long, 3 magicians, and was rather boring actually. The main guy was more of a comedian than a magician. The second act with dummies was totally comedy and not magic, and the third act was basically comprised of a guy pulling doves out of colored cloths. The second show we saw was a 20 minute slight of hand guy who was excellent. A guy from Italy who made gold coins appear and disappear from his fingers after showing both sides of his hands. We have no idea how he pulled that off, but he was so much better than the main show. He was a true showman, much better than the first three who were supposed to be the ""featured acts""? The cost of drinks and the size of them, the quality of the main show, and the overcrowded conditions and lack of direction brings in my 2-star rating. If we were just there for the food, it would be at least 4-stars. We were glad to have gone and experienced the Magic Castle, happy to say we've been there done that. But cannot say that we were particularly impressed by the presentation. Sorry Magic Castle ... but that was our experience.",2 star rating

949,11/16/2016,"When I drove by this place I thought, ""Wow! What an amazing house!"". I didn't know it was a magic and dinner venue with an attached hotel. I was invited by someone who was invited by a member so I was definitely intrigued before arriving.Hmm, well I will tell you that after 45 minutes of waiting to buy drinks, attempt to access two shows that were full, and the expense to pay a $30 cover plus with the knowledge that I will also be required to pay for an expensive dinner ($$$$ by Yelp standards) I didn't feel this was worth the one hour drive. Furthermore, if a show becomes full they don't allow you to wait in line for the next one. You must mosey on to the next one to wait and see if you can make it in. At one point, we arrived at a 15 minute show 30 minutes prior to the start time of 7:15pm. After two drinks and waiting in line I went to the restroom. I returned at 6:57pm only to find they already opened the doors and allowed guests in... my party also had went in. Now at the end of the line, they yelled that the show was full and I would be left out. Luckily, someone in our party came out to grab me and I was escorted in.Understandably, the 15-20 minute show ""rooms"" are extremely small with stadium style seating. Max number of guests... roughly 20 can fit with some standing. After one show, it was time for dinner. We are talking $40-$50 range per person and each person is required to purchase an ENTREE. No soup and appetizer alone. I ordered the Salmon and it was delightful. At dinner they give you guaranteed tickets to 1 of 2 of the 45 minute shows. We were able to squeeze in one more 15 minute show before the main show.The main show was entertaining and the two 15 minute shows, that I saw prior, were also very entertaining but until I physically got to see A show, I felt cheated. My recommendation...(1) Expect it to be a $100-$120+ night if you are a guest of a guest.(2) Guests do dress up so break out that dress you save only for ""special occasions"" and your most fabulous heels.(3) Doors open is a suggestion on the website but I would say it a must if you are trying to get most bang for your buck and may only be visiting once as a guest of a guest. Come as early and stay as late to hit as many shows as possible.(4) There is also a valet (I.e., parking) charge.(5) Be prepared to be enchanted by the mansion itself, the history, and the magicians make this a more wholesome experience. Feels like I was back in time and this was the most prestigious way to be entertained during an era with so limited options for adults to have a good time on any given evening. Nowadays we take ""a night on the town"" for granted because the options to go out and do something are endless.I wish...(1) this place had magicians available during dinner to entertain and visit each patrons table.(2) was a bit more flexible on what to purchase at dinner since there is a cover charge. If I only want soup and an appetizer I shouldn't be forced to pay for a prime rib.Overall, I didn't get to see every show and since this is a members-only place anyways, I doubt I would be back unless invited by someone else and even then, I would have to really have nothing going on and 100 bucks to throw away. Glad I had the opportunity to experience Hollywood's little magic secret.",4 star rating
950,1/20/2017,"Went here for an office christmas party and was not happy before I even got in! I dressed accordingly with dark blue slacks, a jacket and tie.  When entering the building I lifted my jacket to put something in my pocket and the door manager comes up to me and asks me to lift it again. I do, and he says ""wait right there"".  He comes back a minute later and says I'm going to have to change my pants. I, of course, don't have any extra pants on me so he says, well we have some you can wear, what's your size?  As I'm complaining about this whole thing, saying that I am within the dress code, I ask him again what is wrong with these pants? First he told me that it was because I had little rivets (2 to be exact) on each pocket. (these were well under my jacket btw, never would be seen by anyone)  The second time, he told me that it was because my back pockets had a threaded pattern on them and that wasn't allowed. (This ""threaded pattern"" was the same color as the pants and could barely be seen, it was like 3 inches total)Long story short, I ended up wearing a too big, green pair of pants all night. They had a hole in the knee and stains on them. I'm still to this day confused as to how that looked better than what I had on. Anyway, it pretty much ruined the night from the get go.As for the magic, it was hit and miss. Most magicians were pretty amazing but there were a few older gents who just didn't have it anymore, and the main show they had was pretty lame.The food was good as well, and the castle itself was pretty cool to wander around in.",3 star rating
951,3/5/2017,"I really don't understand the draw to this place. It is very difficult to navigate, once inside. The magic shows are mediocre. The food at the restaurant, the same.

I hope to never return. A complete waste of an evening.",1 star rating

A I leave 5 stars for everything else as well, Irma the piano which was incredible and the other fantastic magicians that perform at the castle. It's nice to get dressed up and go to a classy place and know the experience will be A+ every time. Thank you Mike! We will definitely come back and see you sometime.",5 star rating

954,6/21/2012,"What a fascinating place!I've driven by this place but have never been really inclined to go. Came here with coworkers on a Wednesday night and this place was POPPING. It's all about the experience - dressing up (and really, you have to adhere to the dress code - saw someone get kicked out), drinking lots (21+) and enjoying magic haha. A little musty smelling & no photos allowed inside but all minor details. Had dinner first at 6pm - all dinner guests @ 6pm attend the 8:30 main magic show. Run down on the food:*Appetizers:-Skip: Shrimp Cocktail-Meh: Deviled eggs, Ahi Tuna -Try: Portabello fries, GARLIC CHEESE BREAD*Entree & Sides:-Skip: Creamed spinach - I've had much better else where-Meh: Portabello mushrooms (they weren't BAD but I preferred the app fries), truffle fries, onion rings (leaning on the try side because well, I like deep fried food haha)-Try: Salmon - delicious crust on the outside, well done but not over cooked. *Dessert:-Skip: Red Velvet Cake, Cheesecake (not very creamy)-Meh: Chocolate Cake (it was good but it's pretty standard)-Try: Bread pudding, banana cream pie (pb crust!), chocolate ice cream (deep, rich, velvety chocolate - can't go wrong!), creme brulee, tiramisuMy favorite show was the main show, mainly 'cause well Justin Willman (Woot Cupcake Wars) was an awesome host. The following magician acts were pretty great too. We caught two other shows after that were entertaining and different as well. Definitely worth the experience. I'd skip dinner though. But, I think it would be great for a Yelp Elite event *hint hint :)",4 star rating
955,1/18/2017,"No longer a magical place!      The first few times the magicians and entertainers were spectacular. I've been to the Castle many many times as a guest. The food service and the wait staff  are consistent. Good food!  Friendly staff. The drinks are great!     However, the entertainment at the Castle is not consistently magical. Which I believe is the main focus at the Castle. The Castle fees are affordable for me but this is not a cheap night. Which I don't mind dropping a couple hundred dollars in one night if the shows were consistent. Some entertainers are of retired age and their tricks and props are ready to retire as well.  The last few nights we were not impressed  with  The Palace of Mystery.  Which they claim is the big show and often compared to a Las Vegas stage. The only mystery was the outdated decor and glitter popcorn ceiling.  It's not the 60's anymore.    The Parlour of Prestidigitation, is very small and the entertainer is at the same level as the front row.  The room was crammed elbow to elbow. I was bored.    The bathrooms are dirty. The stalls smell like sewer. There was trash on the bathroom floors for several hours. Which means the staff do not make their rounds in the bathroom. I think they're under staffed. They should have a bathroom attendant.    Overall, no longer impressed. The Castle needs remodeling. I won't be back. L.A. Has more to offer than The Magic Castle.",1 star rating
956,1/28/2015,"I came here during MLK weekend so it was packed. This place is by invite only (you can get an invite from members), and you are required to get dinner here (unless you come with a member). I think.I came on a Sunday and paid $30 for cover.Parking is valet only and that costs $13.You can only take pictures outside and inside the lobby. If they catch you, your phone will be confiscated or you will be kicked out.The entrance is cool! I really liked the bookcase entrance from the lobby. Impressed.Inside, they had a lot of different magic shows going on. Some bigger ones had a schedule but then they also had some ad-hoc shows going on downstairs. We arrived at 7 and caught 5 shows throughout the night. The shows with a schedule have lines and since space is limited, you want to get in line 15-20min before the show starts.All the magicians were really great and it was so amazing, especially on the main stage. I haven't been to very many magic shows so I don't have much to compare with.My biggest complaint is that there is no map so I could not figure out where the show rooms were.We made dinner reservations at 9:45pm. They have set times for dinner since they are in alignment with the show times. They were very unorganized when it came to seating people. There was just a bunch of people waiting to be seated and we were all starving since it was 9:45pm.The food actually exceeded my expectations. I ordered the Filet Mignon, which was surprisingly tender and not over-flavored. For sides we ordered the cheesy garlic bread which was super yummy! $9 but so good. As a side, we ordered the Mac n cheese, which was not good at all. It had no flavor whatsoever so I wouldn't recommend this.Overall, an experience you have to try at least once in your life.",4 star rating
957,10/26/2014,"Wow. Wow wow wow!!! WOW!This place is fantastic!!! There were  a few negatives that I'd like to quickly address, and then dismiss before moving on to all the things that more than compensated for these setbacks:1. Overbooked. It didn't feel crowded walking around, but there were so many people that there was a point, around 10:00 that we couldn't get into any shows. So we resignedly sat by Irma, the ghost who plays piano songs upon request. 2. Food service is a little slow Aside from that, this was an amazing experience!!! There is one magician -- Jon Armstrong -- who you HAVE to see!! He's been on the Today Show and is puts on a really funny and impressive performance. The ambiance here I also really like -- very old Hollywood. It sort of takes to a different world of elegance and refinement that our generation is much in need of. Love love love!!!",5 star rating

So, I told two of my gfs about it and with our busy lives we FINALLY set a Saturday we were all free!TRIPLE DATE! YAY!We came here Saturday May 24th.  It was Japan week.  So all the magicians were straight from Japan.  As my group arrived, We were told to show our I.D.'s.  Being memorial day weekend, when my bf showed his I.D. (military active ID) he and a guest (being me) didn't have to pay the $30 cover.  So its $30/person for nighttime . . . $13 for valet (required to valet) We caught a few small shows before our reservations for dinner.  Which was fun.Dinner- ladies ordered the Chilean sea bass while the gentlemen ordered the prime rib.  Chilean sea bass was wayyyy better than the meat.  Flavorful and cooked perfectly, with au gratin potatoes and asparagus.  I didn't really like the dessert we ordered (crème brulee)Dinner was about 4bills for 6 people.After dinner, we caught 2 more shows.  I thought the last magician was the best one.  How the heck did the coin get there?!!? It was cool that most of my party, got to be volunteers in the show! We came home with free memorabilia! Oh, there are 2 bars in the whole castle.  I recommend the bottom bar, stronger drinks and nicer bartenders!My favorite part of this whole experience, is not only i got to hangout with my friends. . . it was IRMA. . .she played most of the requested songs.  Too bad she didn't know any house music! haha!This place is definitely a place you need to go to once in your life!

The experience I would have rated a 5; the food would have gotten a 2. Let me explain.The Magic Castle is a Hollywood institution. It's a box you have to check and you can only go if you know somebody who can get you tickets. This air of exclusivity makes you want to go even more and the expectations are high. Luckily, we were not disappointed. We were seated in the Houdini room and spent a lot of time checking out the authentic props this master of mystery used in his shows. (They do a seance show here that we'll be returning for!) We got to see two shows, one in the main room and one as a private show for our group. The magicians were all great showmen and had us enthralled the entire time. Now for the food. I can't judge their dinner menu as we were there for Sunday brunch. They serve a variety of chilled seafoods, a smattering of unrelated side dishes, and chicken fingers they must have gotten from McDonalds. The worst part was the beef from the carving station. While these cuts are generally red in appearance this meat was absolutely raw. We talked to our server and he agreed. His fix was to microwave the meat. Microwave. Really? At $60+ per person this is the biggest culinary disappointment in LA. Please, Magic Castle, hire a new head chef and make the food portion of your establishment competitive in a market where dining excellence is expected.",4 star rating

971,10/14/2014,"So the Magic Castle was one of those places that I pass by all the time... but I never had the desire to go. Apparently it's a very exclusive venue where you need to know someone who knows someone who's a member/magician. I think you can make reservations, but who knows how long you have to wait or how much it's going to cost. I'm not a fan of magic and I do not like magic tricks. I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed magic castle as much as I did.  I went with a member who got me and two other people in for free. There is a STRICT NO PHOTOs policy and a STRICT DRESS CODE enforced! Be sure to read the dress code on their website and dress appropriately.Our friend took us around and told us all the little details at magic castle. I'm not going to spoil the fun, but every room is special in its own way. Try to find out what makes this room unique. Be sure to check the schedule and find out where the shows are located... since Magic Castle is pretty big and you can easily get lost in it. You should arrive early to some 'close-up' shows because they will only admit  10-15 people who do not have reservations. We had dinner there, and it was amazing. (Dinner must be RSVP'ed prior to the date.) I highly recommend their Filet Mignon and their jumbo shrimp cocktail. The prices were reasonable, and the food was actually good! We also received a special ticket to watch an exclusive show after dinner too! Alcohol was surprisingly reasonably price, when I was expecting theme park prices.

The one magic act that was downstairs, I believe which was the main act was lame as hell. I honestly expected a lot more since this place was called the Magic Castle. The act was just boring and not believable. You can clearly tell when the actor's limbs were sawed off that he was holding fake ones. I will say that the card tricks are awesome.

You must eat their food and note that it requires a reservation, so make one.* Dinner Seatings are 6:00 p.m., 8:00 p.m., and 9:45 p.m. My advice is to not wait til the last one. Doors open at 5:00 p.m.* The food isn't the best. Think tourist one-visit tastes and presentation. Do not come here expecting to get a 5-star meal.* Steak, Chicken, Salmon, Shrimp, Prime Rib are the key entrees and range in price from $27 - $39 each. Sides like Fries, Mac n Cheese, Soups, Salad, etc. are additional.* There are lots of opportunities to drink at the Magic Castle Bar. Plan accordingly.* Often different performers work early and late shows in the Close-Up Gallery and the Parlour of Prestidigitation, so, you may want to visit the same one twice.* Always plan to watch the show in the Palace of Mystery, but the Close-up shows are my favorite.* Parking is valet only.So, how do you get one of the magical invitations? Find a magician who is performing and/or a member (or a friend of one or a friend of a friend...) and ask for an invite. If you're abracadabra lucky, you'll get one.",3 star rating
980,9/6/2016,"Rarely do I ever review a spot twice but this was an exception that I had to after my last experience. Now don't ask me for ""how to get magic castle tickets"". Honestly I was invited by a friend of a friend. Although I have never been a fan of magic. Always found it childish and unbelievable as these grown adults play tricks on us. But my last visit changed it all, can now call myself a believer. Not for the magic but for the performers passion. It is truly extraordinary watching these magicians perform and I must say they have dramatically improved. Maybe my first visit was amateur night or perhaps my mood was different. All I can say it was amazing watching these guys. Enjoyed every room we visited especially the close up room which gave it a personal touch.For those first timers, do make sure to explore the cellar area. There's allot of history down there especially some artifacts from the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. There's also a bar on almost every floor. On special nights they do limited events like tastings or Monday night football.And for those still wanting to know how to get in, best way is knowing someone. If you use a guest pass it's a little pricy as it requires dinner. Recommend just being invited by a friend who is a member. Plus if they're like my friend who knows the castles inside out it makes more stupendous as you explore the rooms with a guide. Awesome place, look forward to returning.",5 star rating
981,6/10/2017,"We went here for my husband's birthday, he is a member so we have gone here a couple times. The last time I went I had the Beef Wellington which is supposed to be their most popular dish. It was great! Will definitely return to get it again.

I really like that they have a berries option for desert since I can't eat processed sugar. Highly recommend this place!",5 star rating
982,9/22/2014,"YOU NEED A RESERVATION.YOU NEED PROPER ATTIRE. 21+ ONLY (except brunch on a certain day, I think?)Don't be that dope who gets turned away because you wanted to come on a whim. What fun! What a magical night even Disney can't deliver! The food is good. Not as good as a steakhouse, but good. I had the spicy ahi tuna, which wasn't remotely spicy, but was tender and fresh. It comes with wasabi, but that's like ordering a spicy chicken sandwich and being given a regular chicken sandwich and a jar of tabasco. The boyfriend got the rib eye, which was also tender. Our food came out quite quickly because we were the first ones seated in that section (right at 8pm). Now the shows! The shows are so much fun. Please don't go being THAT guy/girl who spoils the fun for everyone just because you are adamant that magic doesn't exist. Yes, we know it doesn't exist (99% sure). But don't act so unimpressed unless you're a professional magician yourself. I went to three different sections: the main stage show, the Hat and Hare section with a parlour show and mentalist, and the close-up show. I got picked a couple of times to be a volunteer, and I still can't figure out how the mentalist knew the things he knew! I also got picked for a card trick at a close-up show, which actually kind of ruined the trick for me (can't trick these quick eyes), but it was still a lot of fun! Ahhh so fun.

983,11/9/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!I went there as a guest for the first time last night and I had a great time! Friendly staff, make sure you get a tour of the place if you get there early enough. Lots of history there. The interior resembles the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland. There is a connection between the two but I don't remember what it was. Some reviewers said that they were required to eat... we were not. The staff asked us if we will be dining with them and we said no and they didn't push. There's a magic show in almost every room, it's best to plan out which magician you want to see and at what time because some magicians get quite a crowd and if you want to see them, get in line 15 min early.The magicians are amazingly talented and so funny! they interact with the crowd and most of the shows performed, you cannot for the life of you figure out HOW they did their magic!IMPORTANT INFO:There is a strictly enforced dress code.Men: Suit and tie with jacket.Women: nice dresses/skirts with nice shoes.Parking is valet onlyBe prepared to spend some money. We had a cheap admission because our friend was a member and also has performed there, but from what I understand it's about $30 per person.Drinks were on average $12-$15Ladies, if you're wearing heels make sure you can stand/walk in them for a while. the Castle is 3 stories so there are lots of stairs and they're narrow. Be prepared to walk around all night and occasionally you may have to stand during one of the performances.Make sure you see Steve the bartender magician downstairs... he's fantastic!Be respectful to the magicians.. don't be THAT guy/girl that ruins it for everyone by trying so hard to figure out the trick and says that it's fake, yada yada yada. If a magician asks for some money to be used in the performance or a volunteer... TOTALLY DO IT! Usually you'll walk away with something they use for the magic show as a souvenir, like a torn card or money with your name on it... i personally think that's awesome!It's a beautiful place and definitely a must see! if you get the opportunity to go, DON'T pass it up!",5 star rating

987,11/11/2014,"The magic castle truly is magical! The castle itself dates back decades and some of the world's most famous magicians have performed there. How cool is that? Came here a few saturdays ago for a friend's belated birthday. She managed to get us tickets from a Magician. The whole getting tickets process is a tad confusing, but these invites had two stipulations: a $30 cover charge and a mandatory dinner in the main dining room (entrees required). We came with 6pm reservations and once we yelled ""open sesame,"" were instructed and promptly seated at the dining room. The food itself is slightly pricey with entrees ranging from $30-$40. Lots of people complaining about food on here but it's fairly decent. And you're here for the mystical ambiance and ancient decor!We went to 4 shows and stayed until 1 am. I was truly impressed by 2, really like one, and was disappointed by the final. I think it's all hit and miss, but the magicians are truly truly talented, and it's quite impressive to watch, even if you aren't that into magic.If you can - go the closeup room! It's a very intimate setting and will leave you befuddled.

989,6/18/2014,"I've been to the Magic Castle dozens of times over the last three years, and every time I have a blast!The Magic Castle is an exclusive club for magicians and their guests. Attendance is by invitation only. The food is good and reasonably priced for a steak house, which it primarily is. If you're looking for good pasta, seafood, or chicken, look elsewhere, but the steaks are delicious!Although the food is good, it's not the reason to go the Castle. It's the magic! On any given night you can see as many as seven different shows in the different showrooms. The line up of magicians changes from week to week, so there are always new performers passing through. Most weeks have a stellar line up of performers, where you will see GREAT magic! Sometimes they have an off week where the acts aren't so great, but it's ALWAYS a great time.I don't get the bad reviews on here. People complain that it's an expensive evening. It can be, and if you can't afford it, you shouldn't go. On the other hand, if you're not cheap or broke, and if you're looking for a unique evening where everyone is dressed to the 9s, and you're open to seeing some great live entertainment, it's an amazing place to visit. If you're not into crowds, avoid Fri. and Sat. nights. It gets crazy busy. Go during the week instead, where it's much easier to get into the showrooms without waiting in long lines.  If you can get in, I highly recommend going. It's a fun time!",5 star rating

We were walking to get in line for the show. My parents were walking in front of us, when another group was just happen to merge in between us and then standing in line between our group. So me and and my sister tried to cross the barrier post and stand next to our parents just so that we and talk while standing in line. He approached me and my sister saying we shouldn't cut the line. I was thinking, is he being serious? We were walking together until this group separated us. So I said we wanted to stay with our parents.

My cousin is an associate member there, meaning he does not practice magic but has the rights to invite guests (me) and go whenever. The dress code is slightly strict, so it's best to follow their guidelines, or you will not get in! If you happen to get inside, make sure to try their NPH (Neil Patric Harris) old fashioned cocktail. It's brewed in a wooden barrel & served throughout their bars. It's by far the best old fashioned cocktail in LA. Their bar food is delicious so I highly recommend to try their street tacos.",5 star rating

999,1/28/2015,"The Magic Castle is quite an epic experience. First off, you have to know someone to get in. My father is a member so I have been coming here since I was little. First things first, dress to impress. Men- wear a tie. Ladies, just wear a dress. Don't wear some hipster pants or trendy outfit. The Castle is upscale and they absolutely enforce the dress code. The valets are the first eyes then you have the check in ladies. You will not get in if dressed like a slob. Some times you have to pay a cover charge and some times you do not- all depends on the type of pass you receive. Don't worry, the cover charge won't break the bank. Once inside say the magic words to the little owl and enter the Magic Castle!So..... You should have made a reservation for dinner. I suggest making it at first seating, 6PM. At the end of your dinner they will give you your passes to the show in the main theatre. Once that show is over, you are on your own. Hopefully at some point you will have picked up a little guide and you can make your way to the next show. The shows always change so check on the Castle website if there is someone you are looking for in particular. I have been here many times, so, be sure to not miss: - All of the bars. Try to find the Owl Bar, its ""in between two staircases""- Irma, the piano you can interact with. Give the bird some money!- The close up room, where the magic is intimate and magical- Walk by the Houdini seance room near the main dining room, don't enter unless you have a reservation. If you have a large enough party you can call to inquire about this rare experience. - The phone booth, once you get inside make sure you shut the door! - Check out the basement, where you find another theatre, a library and hey! Another bar! - In the mens restroom just off the lobby you will see a pay phone with a trick device that allows (allowed?) you to call someone with various background noises so as to not let them know you are at the Castle. Haven't tried this in a while, it might be non functional. - All of the things on the walls, architecture, neat things that make it the CastleThe food at the main restaurant is very good. Bar food is also very good. If you happen upon a bar for a bite, grab the Castle chili and fries, they don't disappoint. You could also do the hot dog wrapped in bacon, quite a treat. Their beer is ICE cold and drinks are poured well. The Castle gets crowded. Very crowded. Parking is valet only. Once valet fills up they have you go to some nearby hotel and you get shuttled in. The valet is pretty efficient so once you arrive just be patient with the steep climb up the driveway in your car. Getting out can be tough as you might have to wait a few minutes while the hoards of people leave. If you can't make it prior to 730PM, plan on waiting a while, thats when it usually peaks with crowds.One other thing, Neil Patrick Harris is not the President anymore. Milt Larsens daughter, Irene took over. Not that it means anything, but you won't cruise the halls and see Dougie Howser. But who knows who else you might see? ;)Please, do not contact me for passes, thank you.",5 star rating

1005,3/14/2017,"I love this place, though I only manage to get there every year or so.  When I first went, the food wasn't so great but the experience and the shows more than made up for it.  The last few visits, the food has been as good as the magic and the magic is great!Most of the complaints seem unjustified or petty to me.  Yes, it's hard to wrangle an invite if you aren't friends with a member.  But don't forget IT'S A PRIVATE CLUB.  It's not supposed to be easy to get in and if members just gave out passes to strangers who ask, they might as well forget about the private club bit and just let anyone in.  If I were a member, I would be most generous with my passes but they would only go to people I know.And yes, it can be pricey, especially if your party drinks a lot.  But a lot of great dining experiences are pricey.  Given what it costs now to go to a fine restaurant and then to a Broadway-level show, the Castle seems like a bargain to me.And yes, the dress code seems a little fussy but those are the rules.  It's not like anyone's forced to go.I do have two complaints.  They have this ""no photo"" rule and I can understand that and respect it but twice now, on two separate visits, I've had occasion to pull out my cell phone and even though I hadn't even opened the camera app, I had members (you can recognize them by their pins) yell ""No picture taking"" and scold me.  That didn't seem very hospitable.  The first time I did it, I was just checking the time since I don't wear a watch.  The second time, I was checking to see if I had any messages.  I'm an anesthesiologist and I sometimes get messages that I'm needed unexpectedly for surgery.  I wasn't even thinking of taking a photo and I thought they were rude.My other complaint is how I keep being assaulted with tributes to people named Larsen.  Two brothers name Larsen started the Castle and other members of their family have been involved in the Castle.  I'm sure the Larsens were great people but there seems to be a tribute to them every ten minutes.  One time, I felt like I was trapped listening to a pitch to buy time shares.Other than that, it's a great place!  Try to get there if you can.",5 star rating

1009,5/31/2014,"This place is very special and unlike anything else probably in the world. Part theatre, part delicious dinner service, it attracts the world's greatest magicians and offers a fine dining experience that feels like you're spending an evening as a guest in Disney's Haunted Mansion.No pictures allowed (which adds to the mystery) so unfortunately I have nothing to show for the delicious beef Wellington, 12 oz prime rib, and rack of lamb (probably the star dish) that we shared at my table. Everything was phenomenal and the service may have been the best I've ever experienced. I think my waiter was Ricardo. He nailed it.  We split bottles of wine to save a few bucks, but also ended up buying cocktails at the various bars hidden throughout the castle. The Prestidigitation was a deliciously strong drink that is impossible to say!The magicians performing that evening were top notch as well. The first show was in a tiny, 18 seat theatre, and the world champion of close up magic at FISM (the equivalent of Olympics for magicians - happens every 3 years and only the best of the best from around the world are invited) was there showing off card tricks and dice sorcery. I was sitting maybe 15 feet from him and had no idea how he was doing anything. The headliner in the larger theatre has a show at Tropicana in Las Vegas and was also on America's Got Talent. He was a great comedian and his big tv-sized tricks were pretty spectacular. If you're lucky enough to be invited here, go. Be prepared to spend a lot of money, and don't look back!

1017,11/22/2017,"Been wanting to come here for years, and finally had the opportunity last night. A Busy Tuesday night, I will say, but since it is Thanksgiving week, it was extremely busy and our dinner reservations were not until 9:45 PM. A bit confusing about the shows, which I found entertaining, but with such a limited seating arrangements, you are not able to get into them all unless you stand and wait 45 minutes for the next showing, that only last 15 minutes. I found that a bit odd, so you end up just standing around and hope that there is a magician doing some sort of magic trick in the lobby's of the castle. Dinner started off great, service couldn't be any better for such a cattle call dining room. My food was delicious, which was the filet mignon and the mac and cheese. Unfortunately, my friend had the Brussels Sprouts and found a piece of metal (rivet) from probably the stove in his dish. It could have been ugly if he had bitten into it. He was very low key about making a big thing about it, but for them to just offer us dessert and champagne, we declined. The only thing they did was remove it from the bill. The show that was part of our dining was great! It's a long evening and expect to be there until 1:00 AM. during the week, it was a bit hard. This was probably a been there, done that event, since there is one trick that you'll always remember, how much $$$ has disappeared in your wallet!!!!!! :P",4 star rating

1019,2/13/2014,"Tip of the Day: I'm not very popular (see friends list), so I don't just automatically know magicians or cooler people than me that could invite me to this place. So instead I asked my one true friend, Google. And he directed me over to Magician Mike Wong (Magic Mike!!!) who on his website can help with invitations. Because I'm also a procrastinator, probably why I'm not popular... i see a trend here... I really needed Magic Mike to save my *** to make reservations for a bday. Of course Mike came through, he's magic! I'm so grateful.The food here is ok, but WHO CARES, its not about the food, or this place would be called the Food Castle. Although the shrimp cocktail is really good, so that's a must get. The service is good and the food comes fast, cuz they try to keep you on time to see all the shows.The Magic Shows are awesome. If you come here thinking you're going to watch a David Copperfield performing in Las Vegas, just slap yourself, this isn't the place for that. The Shows are smaller in production value, but has more heart, authenticity, the setting is more intimate and realistic. As the magicians are performing whether grand illusions or close up card tricks, you are cheering for them to do well, vs in Vegas you are just hoping they can make cash money rain down from the sky.Bucket List place, take people you enjoy spending time with.",5 star rating
1020,3/18/2016,"this review is only for the dinner that they make you purchase if you attend. the magic and the experience and the building are all awesome, if you live in LA you definitely gotta find a friend who knows a magician and make it here at least once. Ive been three times, and by far the worst part of this experience is the dinner. It is overpriced cruise ship food, which i guess makes sense since a lot of the clientele are pushing 70. the cheesy bread is about the only safe bet, and even that feels more like something you should be getting at a mall food court. you've been warned, eat beforehand and just get the cheapest thing they have on the menu.",2 star rating

Take a date or go with the family for Sunday Brunch We've been 3 times.  Once just adults, once for brunch (kids allowed) and last night we went for ""young adult night"" where they make an exception to their nobody under 21 rule and let the teens check out the Castle at night. The service - Top Notch. From the second we got there a cocktail waitress was sure we always had a drink in hand. Our server at dinner helped us expedite things so we could squeeze in an extra show and Alex the bartender was so cool to us while we were at the bar between shows. The food- Much better than you would think for a place like this. It's actually really good! Bone-in Rib Eye was solid and my son's beef wellington was amazing!The Atmosphere - So cool. It's literally a Castle that was once someones home, like a hundred years ago. There are so may nooks and cranny's to explore and it's has such an old school vibe. The Magic - World Class. Every time we go we see different amazing magicians. These guys are not only talented magicians, but they know how to entertain a crowd. Our whole family couldn't get enough. Tip - call ahead of time so you understand how the schedule works and you can maximize your time there. We saw three shows plus dinner over the course of 4 hours. It was perfect!",5 star rating
1022,7/23/2017,What can I honestly say about the Magic Castle. It was the most awesome experience I've ever had. I don't get all dressed up a lot so we got to dress up look nice and sharp me and my wife who look gorgeous by the way. One of my buddies had brought me there as an invitation and we got to see three different magic shows fine dining and got to meet the coolest people in the history of American Magic. They even have dance floor the Marilyn Monroe dance Dawn in her High School career as bar tops and so much more history. The castle is a walking history machine every part of it has its own piece of History brought in from somewhere Weatherby from Italy to Greece two here at home all around the states. The Magicians were amazing and most of them are very comical and I think they had the right mixture of Comedy and Magic II really wow someone. They even have the second largest magic library in the world which I find very cool. We weren't allowed to take photos on the inside of the Castle for they wanted to be mysterious to people so they do get that wow factor. However I did take some photos on the outside that I will be attaching to this post. And thank you Justin Hughey for being the best bartender ever. He really knew how to make the night special for my wife and I and to give us that extra zing. Thank you to all the staff who is beyond accommodating.,5 star rating

1026,1/20/2014,"I came here for the very first time last night. It's an members-only club so if you're not a member you need to be invited by one. My guest and I were able to get in because my guest had been once before and bought a picture. When you buy a picture you get a pass to come back during the week and the pass is valid one year from the month you buy it. The dress code here is very upscale, suits for men and dresses for ladies with no jeans being allowed at all.The cover charge last night was $25 dollars a person. When you come with a guest pass you are required to make dinner reservations as well as paying the cover and valet for your car which is $10. Just because you get an invite doesn't mean it's going to be a cheap night! We walked into the main room and were greeted by one of the members. When we told him it was my first time there he offered to give us a tour. Let me say, they have a lot of things to see there. Many things that I might have missed or overlooked had I not taken a tour.After our tour was over it was time for our dinner reservation. They offer three different reservation times on the weekend and we chose the earliest one so we could see more magic shows while the later dinner seating was happening. The dining area we were seated in was themed to Dante, a European magician. The service here was very prompt and the whole dinner only took 45 minutes.For dinner we started with cheesy garlic bread that was recommended by the waiter. For our main course I chose filet of beef and the person I went with got beef wellington. We also got macaroni and cheese as well as creamed spinach as sides. For desert we shared tiramisu. We also had two martinis with dinner. The total for all this was $150 but you also got a ticket with reserved seating to a show. The shows we saw last night were all really good.The one we got tickets for was a husband/wife duo. He did a lot of card tricks while his wife played a drum. The second show was a man with an animatronic monkey. We paid a visit to Invisible Irma and she played A Day in the Life by The Beatles for me on the piano. The drinks averaged about $10 a drink. They were okay but then again, I never tried some of their signature drinks. Maybe those are a little better. After the last show I went to the main bar to get some water. I ended up sitting next to an older gentleman. We got to talking and it turns out he is a member there. He showed me some tricks and then showed me around to some other places we missed on the earlier tour because they were closed off. When we said goodbye to him at the end of the night he gave me another guest pass to go back. He said he liked the look of amazement on my face when he was performing the tricks for me at the bar.",5 star rating
1027,7/1/2018,"I finally made it to The Magic Castle and what an evening it was. Eight of us went on Saturday evening and I would say we all had a great time. The service, food, entertainment and staff did not disappoint and it was exactly how I imagined it would be. The meal was very good but don't expect to come here and dine for hours. They have you on a limit to keep things moving but hey you came here to experience the whole Castle not just dinner. Thank you James and staff for great service. There was one performance that was just okay but the rest were very entertaining and definitely kept you wondering how it was done. If you have an opportunity to visit this place do not turn it down.

Dinner at 6 was lovely - although I had the mushroom risotto which (and believe me, I appreciate the redundancy here) doubled down a little too hard on the mushrooms. We then went to close up magic shows, classic ensemble illusions and comedyslashmagic. I couldn't help wandering off on my own to explore, and found some great little bars and theatres hiding around the place. The magic got better as the night wore on, which may or may not have to do with the number of beverages we were cranking. All in all a great night at a very cool venue. Guys...magic is real.",4 star rating
1033,3/3/2014,"I loved my visit to The Magic Castle. It was my first time here and I was in awe. The place was huge and the inside decor is like an old fashioned saloon or something like that. It was really interesting and cool. I wish I had more time to see performances. I arrived around 8:30 and was only able to see two performances. One of which of the wonderfully talented Tam Vo. It gave me goosebumps as to how amazing his act was. I was also able to see another guy who did shows in Vegas as well and I thought that was really cool. He even selected me to come up and help him with some of his trick. Magic has always been something that fascinates me and I just love watching people do the tricks. Just a heads up though.. this place is super strict on rules... Their dress code is FORMAL.. do not come under dressed, they WILL turn you away. I also overheard the girl working there tell one of the guests that jackets with zippers are not allowed. They want to keep it formal.. and zippers would make it look too ""biker-ish"". I thought that was a bit much.. but idk their castle.. their rules.. ALSO! ABSOLUTELY no pictures behind the main check-in room. We wanted to take a quick picture as a group in a corner while waiting for a show to start.. and apparently some ""Member"" of the castle... called us out on it.. and sited.. ""no pictures in the castle"" and said there was a sign on the outside.. Umm.. thank's captain obvious we know.. didn't think just a quick picture would hurt.. but whatever.. sooo we didn't take the picture.. Not to mention we kept getting dirty looks from the guy and his buddy.. Almost to the point where I felt uncomfortable.. UGH! some people just need to take a chill pill. Anyway, overall had a good time. Glad I was able to try it out. Word of advice.. arrive early to try to get more shows in! The rooms do have limited space so if the rooms fill up you won't be able to go in and would have to wait for the next show time. Each show depending on the act.. could be 20-45 mins so plan your time accordingly! Have fun Yelpers!",4 star rating
1034,6/2/2015,"So I got to go here from a co-worker who knows magicians. I've met them and they're all really nice guys. So it's my first time going. And take this with you if you ever get a chance to go to the Magic Castle you better go. You don't have to order drinks or eat. I didn't eat but I did have a few beers. Valet is quick and easy. Not sure how much it was since my nice coworkers spotted it for me driving. Well right when you walk in you're transformed into a different era it seems. It's very opulent within the Castle. It' seems though it could use a refurbishing in some areas of it but still very nice. So throughout every floor and area of the Castle there is a bar. I lost count as to how many there are. So you're never far from something. Within every area there are also tables where a small group of people can be with a magician if they like. Magicians area scattered throughout the castle kindly performing some tricks or just there to chat it up.  They were all really nice. Also throughout the Castle are a number of stages. Each ranging in size. The first one is a small theater with a more personal close quarters. You get to see the magic up close. This is called the ""Close Up Gallery"" There I saw Andost ( who was very good) and Jay Scott Berry. In the middle sized stage ""Parlour of Prestidigitation"" I saw Thommy Ten and Amelia. And the in larger stage the Palace of Mystery I saw Kalin and Jinger. All acts were very good. And all card magicians throughout the tables outside of the stages were very friendly and very good. I couldnt spot a single way how they did it. One I was quite sure I figured out how they did it but it's okay. There are no pictures allowed to be taken within the Castle but they do have a person who takes pictures that can send you one for $20. I do really really recommend you get this ;) PS Remember to pay Irma a visit and request a song or two like i did.",5 star rating

My husband and I had the two lobster tail special ($40) and we loved it... the lobster was nice and plump and delish!!! and for $40 I guess it was not that bad (although I would normally never spend that much on food)We only got to catch one show because one person in our party forgot his ID so we were waiting for that to arrive...SO DONT FORGET YOUR ID!!! The magic show was awesome. We all enjoyed it very much! Loved how the show was small and intimate and you will get the chance to participate if you want.... so participate!!! Overall my husband and I spent $200 together... which is quite pricy for a few hours....

1038,12/12/2013,"I was very excited to be invited to the prestigious and exclusive club that I've heard so much about. This review is for the tasteless food. The magic itself was pretty amazing, I would come back for the experience but not the food.We pulled up to valet and walked the red carpet, feeling super glam due to the formal dress code. The doorman was a sweet elderly gentleman that nicely said my attire was not according to the dress code but he'll let me in anyways cuz I look so pretty in it. Awwww shucks, he made me blush! I was in a short cocktail dress, cardigan, stockings, 6.5 inch stilettos and a pearl necklace. What's wrong with that? Was it my stripperish patent leather sky high heels?! My guy friend didn't get the memo, he was in jeans n a tee. They promptly sent him down Hollywood Blvd to get slacks, dress shirt, tie and jacket. They do lend out ties and blazers to those who need it.Say the magic word and walk into the main lounge area. We were ushered to our table for some not so yummy food. Our group ordered the crab cakes that were too mayonnaise-y, the truffle fries were nice n crisp with good flavor, cheese bread was meh and the fried calamari's dipping sauce was good. For entrees, I got the seabass that was buttery n flaky but flavorless so I dipped it in the calamari sauce to make it palatable. My friend got the salmon which was also not good. Others at the table got seared ahi tuna, prime rib with lobster, beef wellington and lamb chops. Even though the plates themselves were burning hot, the food was lukewarm. The waiter admitted that everything is pre-made and sat under heat lamps. So is this frozen food that has been re-heated? Yuck!! I guess I'm paying for the show, not the food, there is no need for tasty food if people are required to buy an entree. But seriously for $$$ an entree and the entrance fee, at least make the food good! I was sorely disappointed. 1/5 stars cuz the price does not justify taste. 1 star for the truffle fries and calamari sauce, entrees sucked.The abundance of bars and waitresses to take your order made it easy to get drunk. The drinks were good and strong. My favorite was called Open Sesame: vodka, St Germaine's liqueur and pineapple juice. Oh my, every sip was like taking a shot. I got tipsy real fast.The main magic show with Ed Alonzo did not impress me as much as I would like, I could see some of how the tricks worked. Tho my mind was blown at a couple of acts he did. The card shows were impressive, I could never figure out how some of the card tricks worked.I was very entertained. Go find Irma the ghost, request a song and she'll play it for you on the piano.Also, find the roaming photographer and buy a picture for $20 so that you can get a guest pass to return with seven friends.",2 star rating

I knew a few tricks  myself but these magicians are top! We had the 9:45pm dinner so we roamed around the different rooms before dinner which was a good thing cause the rooms were not yet full.

1041,10/9/2011,"""Open Sesame!""   Commanded at the bookcase, that was our entry through the secret door into this truly magical place.  The Magic Castle is a private club that you can come visit if you get a guest pass from a member of the Castle.  After we paid the $8 valet parking fee, we were waiting outside for our friends to arrive.  Looking at the building from the outside, you truly can't conceive how large the Victorian house you are about to enter is.  To my great dismay, this is the only place where you can take pictures.  They have a very strict policy once inside of no pictures allowed instituted by former board member, Cary Grant.  For a camera crazy Yelper, it is very hard to deal with when you see all the cool stuff inside!  Policy and protocol at the Castle is strictly enforced.  They have a dress code policy which must be adhered to.  This truly lends to the very cool sophisticated vibe of this place.  Great to see all guests and members dressed to their finest!  Evening attendance is strictly ages 21 and over. It is a good idea when you first get there to explore this very large house, with many floors.   It is truly deceptive about how big the entire place is with its many rooms, floors and showroom areas!It is also a goood idea to peruse the show schedule to see what is on tap as far as the day's performances.  Some of the showrooms are very small, like 20 people small, and you have to get in line well in advance if you want to check out that particular show.  We were lucky to start talking to a Magic Castle ""Knight,"" an official member of the club, who was very kind to direct us to a particular showroom and tell us we should get in line for a performance that was an hour away since the room was so small.  He was a wealth of information about the club and magicians and performers on hand that evening.  We had a 6:00 p.m. dinner seating.  Our table chose to order the Magic Wedge salads, NY strip, Beef Wellington and Salmon entrees. After reading some of the Yelp reviews here I was kind of expecting not so great food, but we all enjoyed our meals very much.  Yes, it is expensive, but portions were generous and we all agreed that the dinner was very good.  But really, the meal is not what you are here for. We received tickets that guaranteed entry to one show with our dinner reservation.  That show featured puppeteer, Scott Land and ventriloquist, Ronn Lucas.  Both were incredibly gifted and very entertaining.  I remember seeing Ronn Lucas perform on a program I watched on TV.  My friend, Robyn was a really good sport because little did she know that our front row center seats were getting her involved in an ongoing conversation with the ventriloquist's dragon throughout the show :)We also sat in shows to see close up magicians with my favorite show of the evening being with the featured presenter, Joe Monti, who performed slight of hand, close-up magic that was truly astounding.  We were sitting in the front row and could not believe what was happening before our eyes.  He was incredible and such a great entertainer!  Our last show of the evening was in the largest showroom, the Palace of Mystery, where we saw both Jonathan Pendragon, a grand illusionist and Linsday Benner, an enchanting juggler/performer.  Both were truly amazing at what they did and very entertaining. Truly a must-do LA experience.  I would love to come back and visit again.  An expensive evening but truly worth it!  Entrance fee to the club is $25 a person.  Also read on the Magic Castle Hotel website that you can score guest passes to Magic Castle through booking a stay at the Magic Castle Hotel, which is an idea we are considering for the future so after a late evening, we don't have a long drive back home.",5 star rating

FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO IT AND DO IT NOW BECAUSE THIS IS IN ALL CAPS AND I MEAN IT.The Magic Castle experience is so spectacular that when you go from mind-blowing magic to dinner time--- it's really an incredible buzz kill. I don't mind spending money, and especially don't if the quality is worth my money. But when I order chicken and it's RARE (yes, really) on the inside I will return it. Slowly, each friend would silently mumbled how terrible their food was, too. Then I ordered a salad and they had to upcharge me to make up for the price (each person must purchase an entree) and added guess what...chicken! Look, I rarely give bad reviews nor am I a prissy Hollywood beeyatch but I gotta separate the Magic Castle from the restaurant. After I had such a poor experience I just needed to warn you. This is more of a message to management that I think the experience could be improved SO much by hiring a talented chef and staff to take care of the food.",2 star rating

1047,10/11/2014,"I never knew about this place until my friend invited me. Since my birthday is within a week, thought I might as well treat myself and although it was quite costly, I had a blast.COST: (this is per Saturday brunch, their dinner prices are different)$13 - valet$20/pp - entrance$50/pp (tax/tip) - for buffet style brunch**ALOT right?! ****NOTE: there is a photographer that goes around to take a group picture (of course for another charge of $20) By paying $20 for the photo, also gives you (non-members) a ticket/invitation to go back to visit the castle again with another 8 max guest. Reminder this is only as a pass to go back. Does not include entrance fees etc.FOOD:Many yelpers here have warned that the food was not good at all. I eat ALOT and thought it wan't bad at all. For the price you pay, I may expect more selections and a little better food and quality but generally, its not that bad. (would give it generally 3.5-4 stars if not thinking of the cost). Secondly, my friend had tried this place during dinner in the past and said the dinner was not good and that this brunch buffet was better. So Im guessing that majority are rating per dinner time. I like how there are unlimited mimosas with my meal. It was yummy!  Some of the items they had: omelette bar, eggs, sausage, bacon, smoked salmon, king crab legs (pretty fresh), beef brisket, mac n cheese, cocktail shrimp, chicken enchilada etc. desserts and fruits to name a few. Bad side of the buffet style is the area is SO SMALL. I would guess on average of max 12-15 ppl can be in that little room. Need more space!SHOWS/AMBIANCE:This is really the main reason people come here for. Most important if you love more antique/Victorian style hang out, this would be one of them. It really give a feel back to the past! If you love and enjoy magic that this place will be a definite must go. One show (historic one) wasn't all that great and I pretty much can figure out or have an idea how the trick was done. This one was more for kids. The other 2 shows, the main one and the close-up one was good! The guys tell jokes along his magic and that is a definite plus and talent! This part really completed my day!TIPS:If you don't care too much for the fanciness (they are not as strict with dress code during day brunches as I saw a few in sneakers but shouldn't be in), enjoy eating a lot and don't mind the kids everywhere and just want to come for the experience, then coming during the weekend brunches would be the way to go.If you cant stand kids running around, don't mind paying more for a more elegant/adult type hangout, don't care much for the food as they have set dinners at night rather than a buffet and as others have said, doesn't taste as great, love to dress up, more shows, etc....then the dinner setting is a better bet for you.PARKING:There really isn't anywhere close by you can park unless you want a few mile walk. Not too happy having to pay for valet either but its probably a better bet then to risk a ticket or tow.",4 star rating

1049,12/6/2013,"While it is what you want and expect it to be in the magic arena (hence the three stars), not enough has been said about how truly terrible the food is.  As a non-club-member, you will be required to buy dinner.  I paid $34 for - and I am absolutely not exaggerating here - the worst plate of fish and au gratin potatoes I have ever eaten in my life.  Ever.  I forced my way through two bites of the smelly fishy fish before giving up, and just ate a bunch of bread.It's a good thing my husband ordered the chili to share as an app, because this 7-month preggo lady going hungry the rest of the (long) evening would not have been fun for ANYONE involved.I thought perhaps I had just happened to order the worst thing on the menu, but surveyed the rest of our 7-person group and found not one person satisfied with their meal (though no one else left it practically untouched like I did).The lesson here is not to get adventurous with your dinner order.  Get whatever looks the most difficult to mess up - my guess would be the pasta - and take them up on the refill of rolls.",3 star rating
1050,8/7/2015,"Had an amazing, magical night with good friends and delicious food. The filet mignon was delicious, which in my opinion trumped the 21day aged steak. The magic was everything I'd hoped for from mind control, to white doves, and complete with a giant, fluffy bunny. We even had a celebrity spotting! I can't wait for our next invite to the castle.",5 star rating

Bonus stars to that. :)Everything you see and hear about this place is so dreamy and magical.. makes you wanna go here even more. Then, pulling up into the magic castle is absolutely amazing... very elegant and conservative.. Professional valet service.. Attire is strict etc. Let's begin with food. Not so good.. I love and know my steaks... their meat seems old and was poorly put together with whatever they had going on to complete the plate. -1 star..... JK more like -2. I didn't expect the magic show room to be set the way it's set.. Individual chairs lined together. Look kind of last minute put together layout. The show was great, my husband and I enjoyed it.

The main magic show was AMAZING. No joke, my mind was freaking blown and I'm still trying to figure out how the heck they pulled it off cause there's just no way.....Oh, and for all you Neil Patrick Harris fans...

1053,12/28/2011,"Absolutely amazing birthday experience for me from the moment we walked through the doors until the time we left, an elegant mansion with a hint of mystery in the air which created a magical evening for all. Not sure why so many people are so critical of this place, food was more than decent and there are so many different shows that I'm sure there's something for everyone. The night that my friends and I had come, there was a recent fire in one of the rooms so they had a dinner buffet which was $30 and included the admittance fee. Dinner was good other than the gripe that it was sorely lacking places to sit and enjoy the food so people mostly stood against the wall to eat, but let's be honest we don't really come here for the food. There are several show rooms and with different show times and performers it wouldn't be hard to see all the performances if you come early. All the shows have a little something different to offer from small scale sleight of hand to larger scale conjuring and levitation. There is a decent amount of audience participation and magicians were friendly and tried to get a chuckle out of everyone.Grabbing some drinks in-between the performances helps lighten the mood up a bit too, fairly priced drinks but can be a bit of a wait due to only one bartender at each of the stations. In conclusion though the magic castle can be a bit hard to describe and one of those things you have to experience for yourself be it good or bad. Personally I think the admission is absolutely worth the price just to support the Magic Castle and its up and coming performers.Quick things to note:-21+ only-Valet only, $8-No photos inside-Very formal dress code-$20 cover for non-members-Come earlier to get the most out of everything",5 star rating
1054,1/14/2016,"Chef Marc Murphy was dining at a table right next to us! I didn't want to be THAT person to ask for a picture, so instead, I have it planted in my memory :DBrunch is the way to go. It cost $39.99 which does not include tax and gratuity, but unlimited mimosas/champagne! The wait can get kind of long, but if you've been before and aren't planning to see all the shows, opt to spend the majority of your time getting your grub on. There are two areas to pick food up. The main room has an assortment of the staple breakfast items- made to order omelets, bacon, sausage, eggs, breakfast potatoes.... Then there were crab legs, ceviche, mixed grilled veggies, a chicken dish in some kind of sauce, An array of desserts (mini cakes, eclair, Tierra Misu- which btw, they ran out of before the end of service and fruits- The ""kiddie"" buffet has chicken tenders, fries, ice cream Sunday bar, grilled cheese.... Waffles. I was the cool girl who paired waffles with chicken tenders and chocolate sauce ;) HEY, I was preggo at the time! My family got the chance to watch the main show and 2 smaller shows. The main stage was more elaborate and they had multiple volunteers come up on stage. The host was fun! The gentleman performing the second act did not talk at all. Trick after trick. Pretty impressive. The smaller rooms housed maybe a dozen people at most. Some audience members had to stand. They always let the kids sit in front. I felt the magic and commentary were appropriate for adults as well as kids. Most magicians were able to handle impatient children",5 star rating

Exciting~ :DThere are plenty of bars all over and you can either walk upstairs or downstairs to any hidden rooms where magicians are waiting for their audience or victims? ;) They get you so drawn in, its amazing! I even got to assist a magician on taking a nail out that was jammed up his nose! Gross but what an experience lol!After, comes the dinner. Make sure to purchase the pictures. You get a complimentary ticket. :DThen comes the finale!Wow, I mean wow! The show is just everything in one. Humorous, exciting, on the edge of your seat kind of feeling! Encore!! :DUnfortunately, I have lost my complimentary ticket and now desperately wanting the membership!

1056,4/3/2015,"First off, I just want to say that you should come to this place for the experience.If I could, I would give it a 3.5 stars.The food was very mediocre. I had the salmon, which come with asparagus and some other stuff that I don't recall. Let's just say the asparagus was my favorite part. The texture of the salmon was fine, but it didn't have much flavor to it. I found myself repeatedly putting pepper on it to make it taste better.With a table of 7, we shared garlic bread and fried calamari. I didn't have the garlic bread, but others said it was good. The calamari was great, especially the sauce.I also ordered a cosmopolitan which was good.Total order for my salmon, drink, split appetizers and gratuity came out to be somewhere around $60. Definitely would spend that money elsewhere on much better quality food.However, the magic show was very interesting and fun! I went to the main show, another big show and then to the basement for a more personal show. It was a bit hard to see the magician, but I guess that's my fault for sitting behind tall people. I guess you can think of the $20 at the door pay for these shows, which is pretty good in my opinion.Parking is another $13.So, to sum it up, it was a great experience, but I would not be willing to spend another $100 on a mediocre dinner and several magic shows.I feel like I could find better things to do with that time and money.",3 star rating
1057,5/24/2014,"I went to the magic castle a few weeks ago with my husband on a last-minute invitation from a friend and it was, to be cliche and honest, magical to say the least.The magicians easily earn this place 5/5 stars right off the bat. The magic was amazing, and the best part was the not only the scheduled magicians do magic. Our first bartender did some of the most impressive slight-of-hand magic I saw all night, and he made me a great drink based off of only ""I like ginger and fruity things?"" to boot. Also throughout the castle are other magicians, and we quickly learned that any dressed up male sitting alone at a table was probably a magician waiting for strangers to sit down that he could impress. We encountered two of these magicians, and they added to the experience tenfold. i'm a big believer in ambiance, and this place's ambiance overrides any shortcomings they had ten times over.The food was good, but on it's own I would not give it 5/5 stars for the price. That being said, our service was prompt and attentive in all facets of dinner service which was great.All of the other features just add to that magical ambiance -- the ghost who plays any piano song you ask her to, the door that only opens with the ""magic words,"" and the step & repeat they had out front for photos before you had to stash your camera away inside. I also appreciated the dress code that they truly expected people to adhere to. It is hard to find places where people really dress up for a classy, fancy experience, and one person in jeans can always throw that off -- but not here!",5 star rating
1058,4/2/2015,"It was my first time at the castle. I got a guest pass from a member friend of mine. First of all id like to say that the magic shows were all great. We got to see three different shows. The close up, the parlor, and the big show. The magicians were all talent and very funny. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is the fact that the dinner was so pricey. We paid high class steak house prices for food that was not really worth the price. The food was great, but not at those prices. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Everybody was in a great mood and made the night a great experience.",4 star rating

1060,10/8/2013,"Well for starters this place is formal. Valet parking is $10 and it's $25 to get in. On top of that everyone needs to order one entree minimum and of course everything is overpriced. The rumor is true though that if you find a photographer and purchase a 8 x 10 photo $20 you'll get passes to come back for 8 people.  We had dinner first...entrees start at $26. DO NOT get the Ravioli...we had two people in our party order it and no one finished because it tasted that horrible. I recommend the Sea Bass $34 which is served with potato au gratin. Alcohol is $8.26 (riesling & newcastle)DO try the dessert tho $10 each. We had the Creme Brulee & Banana Creme Pie which was delicious!! I highly recommend the Banana Creme Pie, it's so creamy and delicious. Now I'm not sure why but we were charged for ""fire"" $0. and of course grat is 18% ok...on to the magic! There are several rooms where there are shows going on...actually shows are going on simultaneously throughout the night (just don't miss the main ones which fill up fast). The magicians are good but the tricks are not original and for the price we paid I was expecting vegas status magic. I agree with Michael S. that it's a great trick they pull to lure people into coming here. Even I was lured by the exclusivity. It also gets quite crowded to the point that people run into you and don't apologize...not to worry though since there are plenty of bars throughout the castle to drown out the anger you feel from being ripped off. Set aside the exclusivity and the once in a lifetime nonsense and this place has nothing to offer. Trust me when I say save your money.",2 star rating
1061,1/20/2014,"Ladies, bring a coat or shawl. It gets cold in there!!Parking is valet only at $10.  Entrance fee is $30.  Food is around $30 to $50-something I think, so expect to spend about $100/person.Schedule the earliest dinner, like at 6pm, so you have more time to wander around the mansion.  We didn't leave there until past 12:30am.  The last show was around 12:15am I think (in a smaller room).  We didn't get to see everything.Our dinner was scheduled with tickets for a smaller stage, but we were able to get into the larger show as well on standby at 11pm, so don't be discouraged if you can't book for the larger show.  I actually enjoyed the show in the smaller stage that we had tickets for more than the larger stage show.  In the smaller stage show, the guy we had was the substitute from the original one (so I am no sure how the original one performs).  If you see a guy with scissors cutting paper, that's the one I enjoyed the most.  He's hilarious.Food here is good, but don't get the salmon.  It tastes real fishy.  Hope that after this review they change the taste of it. No photography or video is permitted inside, except in the lobby.  There is one photographer that goes around taking pics, but you have to really catch him to get a pic.  The printed 8x10 is $20 (it's $21 if you pay by credit card) and it comes with an extra ticket to get into the Magic Castle next time (for up to 8 people).  There is also a little red carpet outside the castle for you to take cutesy pics.Now for the magic...........I was blown away a few times, but I kinda expected to see more amazing things.  Still, it was good overall.  Make sure you stop by the Hat & Hare Pub....there's a bar there on the side. Ask the bartender for the time traveling trick.  It is neato, but my friend saw the quick slight of hand. Still, I was impressed.There's no way to see every show, so you have to time yourself and set a schedule.Dress code is strictly enforced.  Guys must wear a suit with tie.  Gals can just wear a cocktail dress. Not much souvenirs to buy......not that I want any......but they should sell key chains and pens. Tiny little section of black t-shirts, mugs and magic tricks.The minus 1 star was for the magic tricks.  We noticed repeat tricks.  It would be great if the magicians coordinate which tricks they would perform, so we won't see duplicates.  I know some people don't go into certain stages/rooms, so they may not have have seen it, but still....there are people like us who did see it and it's like, ""Um, we've seen this already in the last room.""Overall though, I would come again just for fun. :)  Spent 6 hrs there and still didn't finish wandering all the rooms!!",4 star rating
1062,5/31/2017,"We love this place.  We come here a couple of times a year to see some great magic - both stage shows (smaller, but just as good as the big ones in Vegas), and lots of close-up magic.Professional magicians from all over the world come here to perform - and here they are performing in front of their peers, so they need to be on their game.The intimate close-up theaters are my favorites, where you are only a couple of feet away from a magician doing trick after trick, leaving you wondering ""how did he/she do that?"".Evening shows all week are adult-only, just so they don't have to worry about carding guests at the several bars throughout the Castle.  Saturday and Sunday brunches allow under-21 guests, and feature younger performers, including some 14-16 year old performers who have already been on national TV magic shows.NOTE - attire is at least business or evening dress.  Jackets/ties for men, no jeans/shorts/tennis shoes, etc.You either have to be a member ($$$) or a guest of a member to get in.  Well - except for one alternative.  If you book at least one night at the adjacent Magic Castle Hotel, you are allowed entry (you + up to 6 guests).  We love the hotel as well - great staff, and it is an interesting place - 1950's apartment building turned into a hotel, with the rooms still apartment-style (living rooms, dining rooms, kitchen, etc.).BTW - there is a waiting list to become an associate member (a member who is not a professional magician).If you are staying at a different hotel, check with the Concierge - they may be able to get you passes to visit the Castle.Plan on an entire evening - get there early (opens at 5pm) and plan on staying until at least 11 or midnight.  Shows run from 5:30pm until almost midnight, and you still won't be able to catch every one - too much to see.Once in the Castle, all shows are free, and there are magicians all through the Castle doing one-on-one impromptu shows at tables.If you book for dinner at the Castle, you get guaranteed seating tickets for the main show, which is a large stage show.  Otherwise, all shows are first-come, first-seated, and no saving seats.",5 star rating

I was really excited to go but was soooo disappointed when I left.This place is ridiculously strict. Like worse than school. Every time any of the staff came to up to us, it was to tell us we weren't allowed to do something, i.e. we're waiting in line for a show and the lady told us we had to go to the bathroom one at a time and we couldn't ever leave the line, you have to wear a tie, no zipper jackets allowed, no pictures allowed. It seriously got to a point where I felt so oppressed and suffocated, I just wanted to get the hell out of there. They really took the fun out of the experience with all their rules.Thank god they serve alcohol there. It made the rules bearable. I only went to one magic show which was good but the room was freezing. We ordered the portobello fries, chili and ahi tuna tartare which were all pretty mediocre. Each one was like 13 bucks and not worth it to me. I'd rather save that money and get better food!All in all, it would've been a great experience had they not had a stick up their ass.",2 star rating

And Bonnie. You have to love Bonnie. I'm just gonna get the not-so-fun stuff out of the way right now. I suppose a downer would be that have upped prices on guests of members to accommodate enhancements and to encourage becoming members. But to be realistic, they're changing into a business, and no longer a clubhouse, so I don't mind. And let's be honest, the food prices are kinda steep. And seriously, if the staff is being ""rude"" to you, there is a high probability that 1) you are not in dress code--it's black tie attire, people! 2) because you're too drunk and are being a jerk. Or (and this is on rare occasion) 3) it's one of the chosen few staff that have poor customer service. I've spent too much time here to be convinced otherwise. If you're nice, they're nice. Phew, glad that's over!They have really kicked this place into business high gear. A lot of improvements have been made. Rooms are getting upgrades; food has gotten better (their chili is even better now, which I didn't know was possible!); staff is nice if you mention any allergies or dietary restrictions; they have vegan and vegetarian options which change weekly, so you have to ask as they aren't on the menu; and they treat their magicians wonderfully! Always a plus! We all love happy performers.I've seen some phenomenal acts here where otherwise I couldn't. The best magicians and performers converge in one spot to entertain your pants off. Paul Draper, Christian Cagigal, Woody Aragon, Mon Dre, Scott Land, Lindsey Benner, Tim Shoesmith, Doc Eason, David Deeble, Paul Green, and Jeff McBride to name a humble few.To conclude, love the place.

1068,1/6/2014,"Definitely a fun experience to try once, especially for kids.  They definitely kill you a bit on all the costs: valet parking is $15, $15 + tax per person ""door charge"", on top of paying nearly $40/pp for brunch.  Seems like if you buy a $40 brunch, you should get in for free.  Great history and ambience.  My husband had a fun birthday here.  I wish there had been a little more variation in the acts than card tricks.  those got a bit old after a while.  In a few cases, we were able to tell pretty easily how the trick was done or that the performer had an accomplice in the audience.  The Castle ought to expect that patrons aren't quite as dumb as they think.I'm sure it just depends on the date you can get and who is performing--your experience could vary widely.  I was really fixated on getting a specific date.  The food was abundant but pretty mediocre to this foodie snob.  No waffles or pancakes at the brunch, FYI.  level of cuisine is probably fine for the average Joe or little kid.Had I not been so tied to a specific date, I would have tried to get a seance in the seance room and would've gone at night, when I'm sure it's even more eerie/magical.",3 star rating

1071,7/20/2014,"So aptly named!!!! Tucked away in Hollywood, this little gem wows all ages.  We had the privilege of having Sunday brunch here today with our two young children.  It was amazing!!!  There are 3 seatings on Sundays - 10:30, Noon, and 1:30pm.  We had the Noon seating.  I recommend you arrive at least an hour prior to your seating so you can explore. The Castle is two-stories - there are 3 showrooms that have stage shows.  And then there are the side shows that you pass on the way to these showrooms.  There is also a room for Irma, the resident ghost pianist (who has an incredible repertoire)!  We had a lovely Frozen sing-along.There are so many knick-knacks, and pictures on the walls - the Castle has such an interesting history.  It kinda reminds me of the sup'ed up version (x 100) of the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland.The food was pretty good - there was sushi, crab legs, salad, waffles, fries, fruit, bacon, ham, pasta, etc - pretty expansive selection for a buffet.  Mimosas and coffee also served with brunch.  Currently, brunch is $39.95 per person. (5 and under eat free).Admission to the club is impossible unless you have a guest pass, or a performing magician puts you on the list (thank you, Jersey Jim!).  If you are an invited guest, the admission charge ($20/per head) is waived, and you only pay the valet fee of $13 per car.There is a photographer that comes around to take your photo.  Buy the photo for a mere $20, and you will earn 2 more free passes to the Castle.  (yay!).After brunch, you receive tickets to the show at the Palace of Mystery with your bill.  The show is at 1:30pm, but make sure you line up early to secure a good seat (doors open at 1 pm)!  There was a 9 year old birthday party here - it was perfect!!! The magicians included the birthday girl for his show.  It was the perfect Sunday outing.  Completely impressed my not-so-easy-to-impress 5-year old and my 2-year-old.  This is an awesome awesome place for children.  I can't wait to go back just with my husband!",5 star rating

1073,3/21/2015,"This place reminds me of a mini, adult-orientated theme park. The large and small magic shows, the decor, and the dress code all work to transport you to another place and time. You shouldn't be surprised when this one night out costs you $$$. However, as with theme parks, you can get the most out of your money by careful planning. *As a disclaimer: I do not have any strong feelings for or against magic, which probably reflects in my review. I'm sure some of my more enthusiastic friends would give this place 5 stars.*I came here with friends on a Tuesday night. As non-members, we had to be invited to the castle, which was fun because it gave us automatic bragging rights to who would listen. Driving in the Hollywood area can be a pain, especially after a long day of work, but the cover charge is $20/person Mon-Thurs vs. $30 Fri-Sun. Parking is valet only ($13 for guests). They make it more convenient by charging you all at once indoors, so you can use card. From the lobby, you need to say the ""secret password"" to a book case that opens up a passageway leading you to the bar/foyer. We came in early enough to explore and catch a close-up show before dinner. I would highly recommend visiting at least an hour before your dinner reservation to do all these things and to listen to ""Invisible Irma"" play any requested tunes on the piano. Honestly, I was amazed by the first close-up show with John George. We were sitting in the first row, and my friend could barely keep herself from screaming ""OMG MAGIC"" with every trick he performed. Smaller shows also increase your chances of getting chosen as an assistant and taking home free souvenirs. Dinner was mandatory and expensive. I got the lamb (~$50), which was pretty good, but I was still hungry afterwards. No free bread. : ( After dinner, we caught another, larger, close-up show before the main Palace show. The Palace show is what you would expect a magic show to be - with chains and shackles and pretty assistants. By the time our show was over, it was already almost 11 and an hour past my bedtime. However, we stayed a little longer watching small informal acts by the bar. Overall, the magic shows were entertaining. At times, you could see how the trick worked, but most of the time the performances were very impressive. The experience is a lot more fun if you let yourself be swept up in the smoke and mirrors. I would definitely come back again if I had the money.",4 star rating

Formal wear for everyone. Strictly enforced. The magic (of course) is unprecedented. Slight of hand and close up. People are very nice, but with the overly expensive drinks and food, well I guess this is how they pay the bills. Parking is valet only ($10). The place opens at 5 and closes around 01:00 am. This is NOT for children.  Leave the rug-rats at home. We had a group of 7, and we all had an amazing time. If you are vegan (which I'm not) your food choices consist of salad and, well...salad. For everyone else, there's meat. Lotsa meat. A couple fishes too. Consider $40 your base price to eat, not drink. Go, sit down, have fun. :)",5 star rating
1077,8/11/2016,It's magic how fast your money disappears. $20 per head to get in plus around $50 per entrée so if you add drinks and dessert it was almost $600 for four people to see some magic shows. But the place was busy and the shows were entertaining on a weekday so I guess the formula works.,2 star rating
1078,5/27/2018,"The Magic Castle was an experience. The first impression always starts at the door. I was expecting a more welcoming experience. Unfortunately the door man left a sour taste to this experience. He asked if I had a rsvp. I replied yes and proceed to tell him the name on rsvp. He then began to question me on how I obtained rsvp. I said, I was invited by a member. He asked for my rsvp number. I replied I would have to look for it, and so I began to look for the e-mail all while he's holding up the line. He waited for what seemed like an eternity waiting for me to find it on my phone. I couldn't find it fast enough, because I had made this rsvp close to 3 months prior. I finally said, well let me talk with your rsvp person, I had just talked with them the day prior to change the number of guests. After what seemed like an eternity and embarrassing moment. Since I didn't see him question other parties that were being let in. He finally let us in and the rsvp clerk found my name immediately  and I was asked to pay for entrance fee and valet fee.  I don't understand why he made us go through all of that, when a simple check with the clerk would have made this a smooth check-in. Why would we get dressed up and take the time to get there, if I didn't have an invite. This just made me a bit upset. By the way, dress code is not upheld my most guest who were dressed very casual. The rest of the night was great. Dinner was good, nothing impressive. I think the best part was the chocolate salted caramel ice cream and the magicians of course. If you get an invite you must experience it at least once. Don't know that I would attend again.",3 star rating
1079,4/25/2015,"Went with my co-workers for a night out. Don't be fooled at first sight - the place is a lot bigger than it looks like from the outside! Food was decent, and presentation was well done. Definitely check out little nooks and crannies within the building for neat surprises - like a random button in the men's bathroom (not gonna tell what it does tho).Place has an exclusive feel to it as you can only get in if you know someone affiliated with the magician's club which operates this venue. Line up early if you want to get the best seats in the show rooms, specially for the small close up theater.There are intimate side shows all over - though my favorite would have to be El Ropo! You should check out this guy and his curious rope tricks (El Ropo, duh). His dry sense of humor and brand of magic makes up for good showmanship. He's usually by the bar downstairs.",5 star rating
1080,3/27/2015,I love the Castle. I've been here a couple times. Once for Halloween and again around Christmas. Both times were at night with an invitation so we got a table for dinner. The food was really good. I had the new New York Strip both times and it was great! Plus they do themes for the holidays. Everyone was in costume for Halloween.Then you get to explore the Castle which is kind of like a maze. There are about 4 show rooms you need to wait in line or get a ticket for. Otherwise there are nooks that has someone doing a show. Do one of the bar shows! Both times this was the best thing to watch.The last time I went there was someone from some TV show I didn't know but my girlfriend did. So if you are into seeing celebs this place might be good for that. On Halloween we got one of the more private rooms with a large round table. This is perfect for large parties.They do valet only. You pay when you pay for admission. The service was pretty quick. Otherwise parking is on the street.,5 star rating
1081,8/28/2013,"Every Los Angeleno needs to add the Magic Castle to their Bucket List.I've been fortunate enough to visit six times, and no initial pun intended (but now that I've come to think of it)... Every visit has been magical ;-) I'm going to do my best to write down all the useful tips and advice I've received over the years to make sure you have the best time possible.TIPS:- If you want to score an invite, visit the website and click on ""Now Appearing"" to view the schedule. This will list every magician that's scheduled for the next month. Google a couple of the performers names, and shoot them an email. Say you noticed that they would performing at the Castle soon and you'd love to be their guest one night. Flatter them. Offer to buy them drinks. There's no guarantee that it'll work, and it might take 5-15 emails before you find a magician that will bite. Every Upcoming Performing Magician has a guest list, it's usually just a matter of how many spots they have available. Weekdays are more likely accommodated than Weekends.- Almost every review mentions the dress code. The best advice I could give you is dress as if you were going to a classy wedding. Anything less is inappropriate. It really adds to the experience. Also, Jackets and Ties must be worn by men at ALL times.- Arrive as early as possible. Shows in the evening usually start as early at 7:00pm, and you usually need to be in line about 25-40 mins before the show starts, to guarantee a seat (some of the best rooms only have 22 seats). The Performers will switch halfway through the evening, and arriving early is the only way to see most of the shows.- Mixed Well Drinks are very reasonably priced ($8 well vodka), while beer prices can be a bit pricey ($9 draft beers)- The Staff is SUPER nice. Don't be afraid to ask for a tour. There's usually someone on hand that would be more than willing to show you around. The Magic Castle is much bigger than it appears.- Magician Members of the Magic Castle wear a gold pin on their left lapel. A lot of them will freely perform magic at the bar, and the common areas of the castle. If you see one sitting by themselves, say hi! Offer to buy them a drink and see if they'd be willing to show you some of their tricks.- Despite the fact that the Palace of Mystery is the biggest theater in the Castle, it doesn't always offer the best shows. I've had the best experiences in the Close Up Gallery and the Parlour of Prestidigitation. Just make sure you get in line very early.- If you run out of drinks while waiting in line for a show, send a friend to the bar, and continue to hold your spot. If you see one of the Castle Hosts in a tuxedo start counting people, make sure you inform them your friend is at the bar.- Want Another Guest Pass? Hail down the Castle Photographer in the Dining Room and they'll take a beautiful 8x10 photo for $20, which comes with a guest pass that allows up to 8 people to come back to the Castle at a later date. The Magic Castle forbids the selling of passes, so the pass is truly PRICELESS.Enjoy!",5 star rating
1082,9/7/2013,"INSIDER TIP:  99.9% of those attending the Magic Castle and reading these YELP reviews will never know about or experience one of the COOLEST things to see at the Magic Castle. The Castle is a throwback to an earlier time - a time where people dressed up for a sumptuous evening of gourmet food, generous libations and intimate live entertainment in the art of magic. Last night, however,  I finally kicked one of my Magic Castle ""bucket list"" dreams (and you can too if you simply plan ahead).  If you go to the Magic Castle you simply MUST inquire about...The Houdini Seance Room - hosted by Misty Lee. mistylee.com/magic/seanc…The Magic Castle has a very special place in my heart. I have been coming here for over 35+ years, a clubhouse for many of the world's top performers - a place where some of the best Magicians in the WORLD generously share their creativity and passion for making the seemingly impossible.... possible.  Yet high atop the Magic Castle, tucked away in a secret room that most evening guests will never see, is a breathtakingly historic place containing many of the late Harry Houdini's most cherished and priceless items.This is the Houdini Seance Room - a place dedicated to the memory of ""The Handcuff King."" Up to 12 guests experience an entertaining evening (the show itself runs about an hour) that recreates an actual seance, filled to the brimstone with the sights and eerie sounds and some unexpected surprises.My wife and I were invited as guests of famed illusionist/Magician Misty Lee, who dressed the part in a gorgeous Victorian costume and greeted us warmly as we entered the Houdini Room. Misty is the first female medium to perform at the Castle, and she fit the part perfectly. She begins by showing guests many of the priceless items within the room - historic photos and props that belonged to Harry Houdini and his wife Bess. Misty Lee was in control of the seance room at all times- she was elegantly classy and stylishly entertaining! Her dramatic delivery during the seance was spot on perfect - at the end everyone looked at each other and took a deep breath in followed by big smiles all around the table. Just superb and a deliciously fun ride!There are two options here - a 5 course dinner at a cost of approx $120 per person (depending on the day booked) or WITHOUT dinner for a very reasonable cost of only $35 PP (booked with a minimum of 5 and up to 12 guests). Don't miss it.Anyone even considering going to the Magic Castle should not overlook this special ""extra"" for your evening of magical entertainment. Even though I waited 35 years to attend my first seance at the Castle, this surely will not be my last as I fully intend to return for another seance again so friends and family can share in the mystery and fun. The Houdini Seance hosted by Misty Lee gets my HIGHEST recommendation.",5 star rating

1087,3/21/2012,"**NPH is the President? All his magic tricks in How I Met Your Mother totally makes sense now.**I had a great first impression of Magic Castle when I got invited this past Sunday by my friend's friend who was a member. The cover charge was waived and we didn't need to order a mandatory dinner so we ate at the bar and chilled.The bar food was actually decent too, my bf and I split the Magic Burger with Truffle Fries ($12)The whole ambiance is cool, like you're walking into a secret society from the whole password at the door, to the exploration of the house itself. Didn't realize the house was so big until you walk upstairs and just wander around! The decor was like Haunted Mansion meets Buca Di Beppo or something. Really interesting to just stare at everything.Piano Ghost Irma was able to perform our requested Alicia Keys ""Fallin"" and Bruno Mars ""It Will Rain."" She struggled a bit with Coolio ""Gangster's Paradise"" though so I'll let it slide ;)We were able to catch 2 shows for the night, one was a side show with Hannibal. He was awesome! The room itself was set up like a tiny theater and it was really intimate. He was personable, charming, and had a great speaking tone while performing the ""how'd-he-do-that?"" card tricks.The 2nd show was the main show at the Palace room with (I forgot the name already) We were non-ticketed, so we stood in line 1 hour prior to the show and we were the first. When the doors opened, the ticketed members got priority and by the time they finished rolling in, we were able to get in and was already at the last 2 rows of the theater! So yea, if you're waiting for a main show, get there EARLY.The main show itself felt like typical magic show business, where the magician and his assistants were in glitzy attire, lots of arm holding up, and cheesy music. I was unimpressed with the whole girl gets in box, magician spears stuff into box and poof she's ok. :P The later half of the show got better but overall I think I prefer the more intimate side shows if all the main shows are like that. But then again, if I had another chance to come again, I'd definitely try to catch more than 2 shows :D",4 star rating
1088,1/21/2015,"Really fun. Dinner is pricey so I understand why people are upset, but the food really isn't that bad. I think the appetizers were my favorite (I love burrata!) The waiter was a little disappointing as he split up our checks rather oddly and not how we specified, which made paying really hard since we ordered and split drinks/appetizers in groups. Also, he forgot to give us our tickets to the show and we almost missed our show!  However, this isn't his review... it's for the Magic Castle. We had a 6pm reservation and were too tired to watch the close-ups after dinner and the main show. My advice would be to get there early, drink and watch close-ups, with a later dinner reservation.  Time it so you watch the magic show right after and then you can watch more close-ups if you are in the mood or go home.  Oh, and I definitely recommend a Friday or Saturday night. We went on a Monday night and it got late.  Also, smaller groups tend to work better to get into close-up shows.  Apparently, as the night progresses, the lines for the close-ups get much longer(45minwaitforus). Hence, the recommendation to watch a close-up before dinner.  I hope I can get to go again so that we can finally see a close-up!!!

1089,4/25/2014,"Last night I visited the magical castle, and I want to say that this place is so awesome!  To put on my suit and tie on, and see so many Freakishly amazing magicians was so impressive. The castle itself is enchanting, filled with mystery, intrigue and beauty.  I enjoyed every moment of my evening.  The staff is excellent with superb service.  Two Slight Complaints;1. Food is way over priced for what you get, the taste is fine, but the money I spent for the food was simply ridiculous.  However, my experience was so special that I somehow didn't mind that I spent so much on mediocre food. Get A GOOD CHEF! 2. My other compliant was the place was so packed that I couldn't even valet park as the lot was sold out.  I had to catch a shuttle over to the venue.  The shuttle took forever to pick me up, I could have walked faster.  I think they need to figure out this parking situation there for busy times.  It is the tiny little irritations that could put a bad taste in someones mouth.  Yet again, because once I got inside and the place was so fabulous, I forgot how irritated I was when entering.The Science and Magic act was very entertaining.  However, I didn't see much magic in it...  It was FUN THOUGH.My favorites is the smaller room with shows.  I was sitting right on the magician basically and baffled how he did these tricks.  WOW!!!!!!  All I can say....There are many other moments of delight, but you have to go and visit to see all the FUN in person.  Great night of magic.",4 star rating

Love the place, and don't mind having to get dressed up to get in.  The food was  good. And I am glad they had vegan options, though I do wish the desert menu had vegan options. However our waiter was more than accommodating by getting me a bowl of fresh fruit and chocolate sauce. The Absinthe bar at the, is actually fake, which was a small disappointment. But to my excitement they did have one stray bottle of Chartreuse left (goes for about $11.00 a glass). The layout of the place is quite fun with the old Victorian feel to it, & all of the hidden rooms and bars. Just when you thought you have seen everything there is something new that you missed. And the stories/history behind some of the decorations are quite charming.  I can't really comment on drink/food prices, since I am not from the LA area.

These veterans were really amazing and were able to weave their unique stories into each of their acts. I was impressed! We had dinner before and the food was mediocre.  Better than I had expected but a little pricey for what it was worth.  But that's the price to pay to come to an exclusive magic show!Oh yea, I had my leather jacket taken away because it had a zipper on it.  I read the dress code while getting dressed but didn't realize/forgot about the ""no zippered jacket"" part...3 stars because the overall experience was ehh, ok.  I would only be forced to return again for another special occasion of some sort",3 star rating

1095,11/5/2013,"If you look at the majority of the reviews here, no one really talks about the food.  Why's that?  Because the food here just stinks!! I mean seriously there is no other place in this world that would dare to charge the prices that Magic Castle does for the quality of food you receive.  Garlic Bread - a specialty of the restaurant I can tell you the secret of this dish.  Take bread put garlic, butter and cheese on it.  Was it good?  Sure it wasn't bad, I ate it.  But who the hell has garlic bread as a specialty item?  Magic Castle does and that should say something. Beef Wellington - Anyone can tell you I'm a sucker for a wellington but this one really was a 1/3 beef to pastry ratio.  All I really tasted was the pastry and I was pretty much disappointed.  The mashed potatoes that come with it however were good. Filet Mignon - This by far was the best dish of the night as it was actually tender and juicy although it lacked any real flavor.  So if I'm complaining so much and everyone else here is complaining, why the high rating?  Because it's just so freaking fun!  The place has a great vibe and the magicians really are top notch.  Luckily we ate dinner before watching the shows so we were able to end things on a high note.  Everything about the place is just so entertaining that it really is what draws you in.",4 star rating
1096,12/24/2013,"I have been to the Magic Castle 3 or 4 times in the past two years.  I heart the menu.  I recommend the prime rib. My stomach salivates just thinking of the cheese bread.   My favorite cocktail is the Prestige.Be sure to get in line early for the stage shows, especially on a Friday or Saturday night.  A small number of the Magicians can be a little corny during the show, but don't let it get in the way of having a great time.  I have no clue how they do some of their tricks.  I would pay to find out and use them on some of my coworkers.Don't miss having a drink at the Owl bar when you go to the Magic Castle and asking the Owl a ""Yes"" or ""No"" question.  With the speaking owl and the complimenting charm of the bartender there, his name was Will, the Owl Bar is the spot in the Magic Castle for great service and to start up an intriguing conversation with the guests and members of the club. I saw the President of the club Neil Patrick Harris when I was last there.  Everyone calls him Neil.The bartender Will there was very welcoming(and HOT-he looks like Bradley Cooper) when we approached the bar.  It was amazing how he knew how to orchestrate all the patrons at the bar, make drinks for the dining room, and deliver our food and drinks with such attention to detail. Will greeted us with a smile and we left with an impression of the Magic Castle that will last a lifetime.My trips to the Magic Castle are the most unique experience I have when I visit LA.  The Magic Castle was on my bucket list for years, before I was finally able to go there.

1102,10/29/2017,If I could give zero stars I would. We were there last night for the Halloween Event. Terrible food. It was a mix of Dennys and TGI Fridays. I felt so sick afterwards too.  The waitress was passive aggressive. The 'show' felt like a high school talent show where the awkward teacher performs. It was torture for 45 mins. We were in 4th row and I couldn't see one thing happening on the stage. It was literally just a hot mess and I still can't believe it.

1106,11/11/2013,"Giving 5 stars for the magic. Food still a 1-star. Since my review and the letter I wrote, I have been contacted by the General Manager (there is no Food and Beverage manager) and my magician host. I am appreciative at the quick response and personal attention given to my feedback, but apparently mine was one of a few complaints out of hundreds if not thousands of satisfied diners. I did want a refund, but my review is not based on blackmail, coercion or lies, it was true and unbiased. If I get a refund or not, the experience - agreed with or not - is what we had and remains the same. I have been to other exclusive clubs, I'm not unfamiliar with premiere parties, and while I may still have a few problems with what knife to use (start from the outside in), I am familiar with formal dining.Whether or not you have a lot of money or a little money, when you spend it you have expectations. The food did not meet my expectations. If it comes up during a visit to the Magic Castle, I would urge anyone with an issue to try and address it at the site and contact your host if possible - as hard as it may be when in the midst of your guests and all the magic, but it could provide for quicker clarification and resolution if necessary. Management seems to be sincere about taking care of things, and has said to have taken steps to address some of the issues I brought up.Also, it was pointed out to me that there is ADA accommodation and ""secret passages"" (my embellishment) to assist the mobility impaired, I have updated my original review accordingly. It was *my error* that I did not see that on the website. We did not ask for assistance and we knew about my mother's knee prior to our visit so that was not a Magic Castle issue (other than the cold).Yelp exists as a public forum, a forum which I used to express my opinion, and it is in my opinion that if you're unhappy with something then you should state it. My ""call to action"" was not a call for everyone to ask for a refund - I did, and I do ask for refunds when I feel they are warranted - but my intent was to call to the management of this and other establishments to listen to their clients. They can't hear you if you don't say anything, and in that respect, both positive and negative feedback should be given. I don't write negative reviews and then try and force an establishment to pay me off, just as in I don't write good reviews to get free items.I'm not holding on to some kind of grudge or purposely trying to slander or embarrass the Magic Castle. I've had bad food before and I've written negative reviews before. Refunds aren't mandatory, if they were, there would be no shops or restaurants still open based on Yelp reviews. I spent a lot of money (to me, obviously, it's not a lot to some), I was unhappy, I made my case, life goes on regardless of who agrees with me or what you think my motives were. This probably won't be my last negative review about anyplace, but there can always be hope that it is. Reviews can be used to see what you're doing right and what you're doing wrong - that's the point of an honest review.",5 star rating

I ordered the rigatoni which was too spicy and blah and my husband ordered the ridiculously dry chicken. Our waiter was extremely creepy and made me feel uncomfortable the whole time. Never got my ketchup for my truffle fries and had to ask twice for Parmesan cheese to cover up the bad pasta. My friend ordered the garlic soup which was nassssty ! 3 other people tried it and agreed. Only thing that was good was the banana cream pie. Also when the waiter brought he desert menu we noticed there were ""bar bites"" for half the price of the regular menu (sliders, burgers) what the heck ?!  Why did they show that after we ordered 100+ for gross food ? Over all very disappointed , I gave it one star for the magic show. The food sucks , you've been warned ;)",1 star rating
1110,12/6/2018,"Awful, overpriced, lack of 'magic'... The rudest staff in Hollywood, which is saying a lot! Nerds from high school getting their revenge is a way to put it.. but nerds are awesome, and these woman (men were actually nice) acted like they were above / too good for you. (sweetey you're pretty much just a human coat rack in a mildew filled basement, humble yourself). The dress code is subject to the hostess/cashier, and it is more of a personal judgement rather than a set dress code. I wore a designer fashion blazer, and it wasn't the specific type (old and smelling of moth balls clearly), therefore had to wear a house blazer. Honestly would have been fine if the dude behind me wasn't wearing a metallic snake skin blazer... mind you mine was dark navy and matched my suit. Then the ridiculous costs...You have to pay 25$ cover, then you HAVE to get an entree per person which are all $40+ for mediocre food... oh and 20% gratuity is required as well... But, dinner was the best part by far. The magic show was painful, it was mostly a performance piece done behind a skrim / projection panel. Not magic! Oh and I guess they have a piano that automatically plays music.. groundbreaking. Bottom line, so bummed that the staff were acting so snotty, it's not fun to be treated like your less than, walk out 200$ in the hole... and leave a 'castle' without seeing any magic.. Venice beach has 100x more talent / smells way better. Go there folks!",1 star rating
1111,1/25/2018,"This place was not what I expected everybody make a big deal out of it and it's really not, We were there for brunch On a Sunday by the time you pay the entrance ticket and the lunch with two beers for two people we ended up spending $200 and we only got to see two teenagers doing some cheap card tricks!!!!!",2 star rating
1112,9/1/2014,"This place is pretty neat, it was built in 1908 and looks small from the outside. The place seemed crowded that night and the hallways were pretty narrow. The magicians were funny which didn't make their magic tricks seem ordinary. The dining was pricey and the food was not that great. The cover charge for both my husband and I including valet was $70 plus dining which was $100 for both including an 18% gratuity because we arrived in a group of 6 or more. They have a very small gift shop which is the size of a coat closet. Waiting to be seated was a mess, there were people waking through and trying to get to the magic shows by walking through the dining area and waiters and waitresses trying to get through the crowd as everyone waited to be checked in and get seated. The main show was pretty neat and had more seating. It was about 45 min long but didn't feel like it. No photography was allowed and it was a 21 and over event. My overall experience was great except for the space, not recommended for closterphobics.",4 star rating
1113,11/4/2011,"What would make this place super amazing is if the magic shows were amazing.The 2 times I've gone here I was disappointed in the magic shows. Not funny, not creative, so obvious that it's not real. Do they even do a screening for these magicians?My company came here for dinner...which has gotten better since 4 years ago (before the prime rib was SO BLAND and everything was gross). However, all the appetizers, the prime rib, mashed potatoes, etc etc were amazing! I was pleasantly surprised at how much better the food is (however not comparable to of course restaurants that specialize in steak). The main stage needs to be renovated as the people in the back can't see what's going on. I think my favorite part of the magic castle are the small shows. That night we went we actually saw ""freak show"" and it was pretty cool. Should definitely come here if you get a chance (just once even if the magic is corny and obvious). They now sell membership for a month...or if you want to take your friend you can take a picture in the main dining room, buy it for $20, and then it serves as an invitation for next time....or you can meet a magician.",4 star rating
1114,11/29/2013,I must first admit I am biased about this place.  I used to be a member here when i was performing magic in high school and college.  So take this review with that in mind.  The reason I give this place 5 stars is because of its importance to the magic community.  Its a historic sight that has housed some of the best magicians of our modern time.  Its an excellent resource for the young magic community to learn and be taught magic.  I first became a member at 16 when i was accepted into the JR. magicians program.  I learned so much from the staff and members of this great establishment.  Should i want to become a professional magician this is the place to learn.I recently came back after 10 years with a group of 8 friends who had never been before.  We went on memorial weekend and they were having a special event showcasing veterans performing magic.  While it wasn't the best representation of magic ability there were a few old timers who really did some great magic.  All in all everyone had fun and it was worth the trip.The food was excellent.  I had a filet and it was cooked perfectly.  The dinner is pricey but its to offset the costs of the show etc that are free.  If you get a VIP ticket you can even skip the door charge.  Come here and enjoy being wowed by some of best magic around.  If you have ever seen a Vegas magic show this is a nice change of pace as most of the magic is done a few feet infront of you rather than 100 yards on a stage.,5 star rating
1115,9/27/2011,"Magical!Go with a group of friends for a really great evening!I've been several times, from a small group of 4 to a big group of 70, and I have loved each and every visit!It's the best reason I can think of to get dressed up.Food was exquisite, and to drink I ordered a cosmo ""with magic and fire!"". Did it come with magic and/or fire? No. But when we got the got the bill, it said that they included FIRE in the cosmo free of charge. Ha! We all thought it was funny at the table. Maybe you just had to have been there. Anywho...The other night we were at Hat and Hare Lounge where Tony ""the cardfather"" Picasso performed.  He's a bit creepy but his card tricks are insane.Our host, Roddy was the best ever.  He wrangled the stragglers of my group in time for dinner and shows and he ensured everyone got the most of the evening. Thank you Roddy!During your visit, go exploring! There are multiple levels and surprise talent and bars around every corner.You're dressed up,  you're visiting a Victorian mansion, you're being entertained for 6-7 hours, you're celebrating-- Expect to pay for it.  It is not a cheap evening BUT is TOTALLY worth it!",4 star rating

1117,12/27/2013,"This is always a night to remember. Fun shows, good drinks, good food. Here I would say order the steak. Every time I've been here I want to order on the cheap side, but it's only a small amount more for the beef and it's always delicious. Explore! There are lots of rooms and lots of shows. The more you dress up, the more fun. But you are walking around and occasionally standing in line, so prepare wisely. Valet parking is ideal, unless you want to walk up the hill. I've done it. In heels. So it's possible. Although, at one point, I actually thought I might not make it. Great place for a special event for a small group. Birthday celebration, anniversary, or holiday!",5 star rating
1118,6/29/2013,I had the privilege of visiting Magic Castle for the first time thanks to Nelson F. We were fortunate enough to have him show us around and give us advice on which shows to see and a little bit of a background about them. He even showed us some amazing card tricks.The Magic Castle is an member only club with many different magic shows going on each night. You can attend without being a member if you are lucky enough to get a pass from someone who is a member. You are required to attend dinner and pay $25 for admission. Valet parking for the castle is $10.The dress code is very strict. Gentlemen have to suit up and ladies must be in evening or cocktail attire. Pick up a program for the evening at front desk and pay for valet before you go in to avoid waiting later. Go up to the owl and say the magic word and the door will open for you.Make sure you go early to wait for the show you want. There are many awesome shows. The tricks were very impressive and the magicians were all very entertaining. They really use the audience to participate.Be prepared to be there for 5-6 hours to get the most of your experience. Don't forget to visit the many amazing rooms and go see Irma. She's the ghost that plays the piano. You can ask her to play whatever song you'd like.,5 star rating
1119,4/27/2014,"A completely unique and entertaining experience! It's a inner child's dream come true when you combine magic inside a castle. My friend got an invitation from her coworker & it was such a great night. They recommend getting there as early as you can to get in the most performances. It is stunning when you enter the lobby and see the sliding bookcase entrance. Lighting is dim and the place is so elegant and classy! Everyone's dressed up cocktail attire and some ladies in flapper dresses. Loved exploring the castle as it seems there seems to be a close-up magician in random rooms and alcoves. This weekend was a special Magic vs. Science theme that was neat, but lacked magic. Our group felt like it was a bit lackluster since we expected the main performance to be filled with classic tricks and to upstage everything we had seen earlier... My favorite magician was actually doing close-up magic at one of the bars! But each member of our group of 7 got to interact in multiple tricks, and it's nice feeling like a participant rather than just spectating! Lines for some of the rooms seemed to be full every time we passed so I recommend getting to a room about an hour before.Cocktails were delicious and priced reasonably considering the venue. Everyone we met were extremely nice and friendly as we were all just taking in the atmosphere! If you know a member, I'd definitely recommend going!",5 star rating
1120,7/6/2014,"I've been wanting to come here just to see what the hype was all about since you can only get in through invites.... aaand my wonderful boyfriend made that happen for our anniversary.1. Must dress formally2. If you buy a picture from the photographer, you get a pass emailed to you to bring back up to 8 more people in the future from Sun to Thurs, I believe3. Pre-drink if you can because the drinks are on the expensive side.Food was fairly on the mediocre side with expensive prices attached to it. I feel like with the amount of people who complained about the food... that they would do something to make it tastier. My filet was tender, but it was kind of lacking some flavor. I had to eat it with some horseradish to give it a good kick. Even the dungeness crab meat on top of it didn't do much for me. When you are paying similar prices at Ruth's Chris for their steaks, you expect the same. My family are obsessed with Outback and even Outback's steaks are cooked better. My boyfriend got the herb crushed prime rib which I liked more than mine and he thought it was okay too. We got the cheesy bread as an appetizer and it was nothing to rave about. The dessert, on the other hand, was so good! My boyfriend (I don't know how he manages to always order better food than me) ordered the chocolate mousse with the vanilla bean ice cream on the side ... that was sooooooooooooooo good! The server told us that the kitchen was trying something different with the chocolate mousse and I've never had their old creation ... but I loved this one! Maybe they should fix up their steak menu a little, huh? I got the banana cream pie with vanilla bean ice cream which was good too! I think I would have liked my dessert a little more colder/chilled ... some parts of it was a little thick, but I thought it was good anything.Service was fairly good. We ordered drinks that I thought were okay.Show: Entertaining! I'm always trying to watch them closely to see how the magic unfolds but most of them are so good. The main show was fairly good, I like the last act the most with the character who played the Thing in the Addam's Family. We went to two smaller shows later and I think we both enjoyed those more. Get in line early for the shows because seats get taken up fast.Overall, I gave a good rating mostly due to the magic and not because of the food. I think it's a fun one or two time experiences that everyone should try to do if they get the chance. I think the exclusivity of it draws people in and I think that's smart.",4 star rating
1121,11/1/2012,"This place is the best for a couples date or impressing some out-of-towners looking for some Hollywood Magic! Some people have told me the food wasn't that amazing and overpriced for the quality, but I thought the fare was decent. It's included to watch the show anyways so I say fair deal. I've been to Cirque shows that costs as much and less entertaining than the Magic Castle, and they don't include dinner. I got the prime rib, and it was cooked exactly how I specified. It was juicy and even the rolls that came with the dinner was special, it had a hint of rosemary in it. Our service was impeccable, helpful in answering our questions (tobacco onions) and great timing with refills on drinks. I've never seen waitstaff dressed to the nines, he was wearing full formal attire with a swallow-tail coat! Having a formal dress code just added another layer of magic to the evening, is not often you get to play dress up! :DThe main show was fantastic, the host was on point with the wit and charm. I was blown away by the tricks and was like ""WOoooooooooooow, How did they do that?"" with every trick. The smaller side shows were just as entertaining but could use some more polishing. The mentalist, Carl Christman, had wonderful tricks that were flawlessly pulled off, but his jokes could have used some improvement, they were face-palm cheese worthy. I was once taught a simple ""vanishing"" business card trick using slight of hand. Since I couldn't master it I called it ""stupid"" in my frustration but my friend corrected me to matter what, tricks aren't stupid just the person who failed at it. :pA memorable night, long after the shows were done my group continued the fun in guessing how the magicians pulled off their tricks.",5 star rating

The first time was almost 6 years ago (had dinner, watched a magician friend perform). My 2nd time, I didn't have dinner at this establishment, but did get some drinks.The Magic Castle is very fun and entertaining. I got to go with a group of 6 and everyone had a great time. We went on a weeknight (much less crowded) and 4/6 of us got to assist during the shows! I especially loved the smaller, more intimate rooms (Close-Up Gallery and Palace of Prestidigitation). Take advantage of the lounge areas where magicians can perform for small groups. Even more intimate!Definitely dress appropriately. Ladies-please avoid the body-cons and platform heels. This isn't that kind of place, lol. Guys- you're required to wear dress shoes and a jacket/blazer. If you don't wear a jacket, they'll make you loan one and it will most likely cramp your style.Have fun!",5 star rating

1125,7/25/2014,"I came here for my cousin's birthday. I've never been to any actual magic shows, so this was a pretty good experience for me. The magicians were all funny and entertaining. Each of them had their own special show and it's mostly different, so I liked that. Some of the magicians would pick a volunteer to go on stage, but I'm glad I didn't get picked lol For their dress code, you do need to dress in formal wear. You can check their website on the details for that if you ever decide to go there :)They don't alllow any photo-taking, even selfies, but if you want to have your pictures taken, there's a photographer there who will explain all the details about that.The food was really good, my cousin shared half of her kale salad that came with very thin, sliced peaches and some nuts. I got the California chicken which came with some veggies, a somewhat half sliced avocado, and pasta. Although, the chicken was a bit dry, but it was still good.

This a one of the places I have always wanted to experience, but never got around to yet. There were 3 important parts of this experience. The ambiance, the food, and the magic!  The ambiance was incredible from the moment you pulled up!  I was fascinated with the venue, and could have spent hours just wandering around and taking the historic and ""haunted"" feelings in. The food was as good as any higher end restaurant. All of our main proteins were amazing, however the garnishmenta were horrid.  The cocktails were spot on!The magic. . .

We enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar as we waited for our dinner reservations. The complementary bread was warm and delicious. I ordered the Macadamia Nut Crusted Sea Bass with yam puree and mango soy salsa. The fish portion was generous, but a bit on the dry side. The yam puree was good and the mango salsa was sweet. Next time I think I'll pass on dinner and go straight for the magic! We missed the first showing of the big show, so we had to wait 30-40 minutes for the next one. The show was astonishing and left me confused as to how the magician pulled off his trick!!! Only complaint I have is that we had to wait at least 30 minutes for the shows. The view from the Magic Castle is beautiful, but still not as gorgeous as the view from Yamashiro just up the hill.I hope I'll get invited again, so I can take advantage of more of the magic shows!",4 star rating
1128,4/5/2010,"From the second I set foot through the secret bookcase door I knew I was in for an epic evening. A night full of fun and questions. Where the hell did all those cards come from? The magician must have pulled 10 decks worth out of nowhere. And excuse me, how did the other guy get the $5 bill that my girlfriend actually signed inside of a lemon? I don't get it, it's crazy. The bill still smells like lemon even today.I personally feel the lower reviews complaining about the style of magic are skewed. If you're expecting Harry Potter to fly down on a broom and cast ""real magic"" in front of you then you should see a therapist. Also this isn't Vegas, there isn't a multi million dollar production with a 40 person crew to assist. This is first hand, close up magic.Appreciate the Castle for what it is. People working magic directly in front of you, sometimes merely a few feet away. I'd much rather be blown away by a master of sleight of hand in front of my eyes versus seeing a white tiger from 100 yards back in a sea of people.The magicians here are amazing, very very skilled at what they do. There is no place I've ever seen like the Magic Castle, 'unique' doesn't do it justice. We sat in a small room with less than 20 people, sitting on the edge of our seats watching a performer from Germany. Previous we were front row for a unique performance from a female magician from Tokyo, and before that an epic performer from France. Magicians come from around the globe to show their skills off here and show off is what they do.I found it quite fun to dress up, suits and ties only for the gents. Catch a few shows, eat an amazing dinner, then go back to the magic. We spent 6 hours here and it wasn't enough for me, all under the roof of one beautiful building up on a hillside.I have a feeling I'll be thinking of this night for a very long time to come. I'll think of it often, until I get another chance to visit.",5 star rating

1131,11/12/2015,"We went for a friend's birthday expecting to have a good night. Sadly it was anything but...It started as we entered the door. After reading the dress code thoroughly I showed up in very expensive slacks thinking I was just fine. But evidentially they do not allow back pockets to be sewn on the outside (even if fully covered by the coat!). They were dark pants with dark sticking so you pretty much had to have your head up my rear to even see them, but they held out group of eight people up because of this!! You might have thought the president of the USA was inside the building they were so over the top with my pants...When inside they hassled one of our group members for checking his phone. (Silently)We tried to order an initial drink round and the bartender was just plain rude. Dinner was better than expected but horribly expensive for what it was. And to wrap up the evening- we were told specifically to see a show downstairs. When we got there the guy was counting his money and not available for a performance! Yet, as though this isn't enough to be a miserable evening.... When we went upstairs to catch a 1030 or 11pm show (I forget right now) but after waiting 20-30minutes at the door.... The performer said the show was canceled and he wasn't gonna perform and we should go find another show...  And it was too late!!! They had all been started or otherwise full!Waste of money.

1132,9/21/2013,"Was able to visit last night (Friday) for the first time through a friend of a friend that is a member that gave her guest passes. Even with guest passes, its $25 per person. Reservations are required- I hear Saturdays book months in advance. Valet parking $10. This is a super exclusive members only, VIP type of place. Magicians (I mean weird or nerds-jk) only, lol. I had NEVER heard of this place before. This is such an underground world to me. Who knew magic was so ""cool??"" The place was packed with people of all ages and colors (friends and I in our late 20s but definitely saw some 30 somethings, 40 somethings and even 50 and 60 somethings). I saw Asians, African Americans, Caucasians, etc.  Anyway, this year, the castle is celebrating its 50th anniversary. Strict dress code enforced for men and women (see website). Men are to wear suit and tie/blazers and women in cocktail dresses or skirts. NO JEANS, NO SHORTS/SWEATS, etc.The castle's interior: paint, furnishings are dated and just might be the originals. The castle is hard to navigate-finding the shows/rooms was confusing. They are also super strict on photography. No photos allowed. I guess I understand that since its magic but I found it annoying we were told no photos in the dining area. We were no where near a show or magician and the photo was of US...we saw other people taking pics in the dining area. Since we had dinner reservations at 9:45pm, we got tickets to the main show. The main show was totally worth it.  The weekly schedule rotates so magicians far and wide perform there, I don't follow magicians/ magic world so they all seemed really good and entertaining to me. The shows we watched were totally scripted (which is fine) but i def appreciated the comedy side to the show as well as the magic. To sip: had the Lovely Assistant ($14) but tasty also the Magic Castle bubbly (yummm).Dinner: Had reservations at 945, appetizer (calamari- liked the sauce and calamari was good too) came out quick but entrees came an hour later. I had the salmon- enjoyed every bite of it. Did not care for the veggies on my plate :(. The rice, however was delicious. The bread was awesome! I could def taste some cinnamon in those rolls! Dinner for 4: appetizer (calamari, 4 entrees (2 salmon, 1 lamb, 1 chicken) and bottle of bubbly= $200). My friend complained his chicken was dry but enjoyed the lentils. My friend with the lamb asked for medium cook on the lamb but lamb was totally rare and very bloody :/). We saw one show at the Prestidigititation at 930 and the main show at 1130pm and an up close magician around 12:15 or 12:30. Get there early to get the most bang for your buck to watch more shows. The shows can only seat so many so the shows fill quickly. No standing room allowed. The place is huge! I'm sure we did not see the entire thing. Seems like it would be an awesome place for a haunted house or halloween party. I would love to return if I ever got the opportunity- not likely. Go if you have the opportunity!

1135,9/26/2014,"One of those places you could try once for the experience, but I think it's a little overpriced. It's super exclusive, as you can only come if you're a member, a guest of a member, or a guest of a magician that shows at Magic Castle.PARKING: It's Hollywood. Valet only. FOOD: Mediocre at best. Had the SPICY AHI TUNA - rice was not cooked well. Pretty sure it wasn't sushi rice. Tried the BEEF WELLINGTON and it was okay, nothing special. MAGIC: Get there early to catch the shows! Ask the front desk because they'll give you recommendations on when to line up for shows and the timing of it all. My favorite was the close-up gallery because it was a more intimate show and the magician that night was really good! There was a female magician and she was NOT funny. She kept laughing with someone in the audience about inside jokes and it was awkward. No one watching thought she was funny so she even made jokes about her not being funny... and still no one laughed. I guess there really is a reason why there's very few female magicians in the game. We got to watch another show after that show finally ended and he was funny but I figured out the magic and it wasn't as magical after that. The last show of the night which we got tickets for was pretty good too - there were two magicians and they did separate shows but played off each other and split their time evenly. However, it was easy to figure out the magic there as well! MISC: Irma the piano will play whatever you want, just ask her. Enter into the door of the Magic Castle by saying ""open sesame"". I hear the bartenders downstairs will do magic tricks as well, but they weren't open the night I came.OVERALL: It was a beautiful night to spend with friends for the experience, dressing up and getting to take pictures at the ""red carpet"".

But anyway...I've come here a few times and I've had a blast every time. You end up making new friends. When you go around a big holiday, their shows will be holiday themed. The best shows for me were during Halloween season in Oct. I was almost on the floor laughing. These magicians are PROS, so good... they can mess up a trick but still pull it off at the end. They rotate and have different magicians from all over the world every week.Wear your best jacket and tie. Start at the bar before the first show starts.

1137,8/6/2017,"I was completely disappointed from the time we arrived until I felt happy and relieved to get the heck out of the place. We went on an very busy night however that does not excuse the lack of any courtesy for the guests. We booked this two weeks in advance for my wife's birthday and was given one of the worst tables. When my daughter questioned the hostess we received a very uppity remark of not being part of the regulars and knowing. The food and service were excellent. A far cry from the last time we attended years ago. Going to the various attraction as I am temporarily handicapped was a nightmare.The chairs in the rooms are on top of each other and if you need to stretch you leg..it's not happening. The whole place is stairs and their is no seating whatsoever around the bar unless you happen to get a break to sit in a space. People just lounged forever not making it at all possible to get near the bar. Forget the smaller rooms..they were a tiny joke. Even trying to find a place to sit just to wait for our group to leave at the valet service was not possible. Not one chair anywhere. Don't bother to call. I did and spoke with the managers assistant and then the manager. Once speaking to the manager it became quite obvious that his attitude was well represented by the staff.  They probably heard this before, or quite frankly could not care less. The place is busy and they don't need my business to stay open. Just not to friendly if you have any special needs. I realize this is a very old and historic building and is a treasure, however some minimal accommodations such as a couple of reserved handicap places to sit or seats in the shows might make a huge difference for those in need. The ADA should visit this place one day.",1 star rating
1138,8/22/2013,"I had a... dare I say it? MAGICAL experience at Magic Castle. (Please, hold your groans until the end of the review.)My friend and her boyfriend were visiting me recently and said SO is a huge fan of magic (the skill, not the card game). When they arrived in LA, they told me that he had obtained a temporary membership to Magic Castle and had reservations on a weekday. We were warned that we needed to be dressed appropriately--men in jackets and ties, ladies in appropriate evening wear. I was over the moon; I couldn't believe I'd have the opportunity to visit this mansion after I'd heard so much about its exclusivity!I don't want to give away too much so as to not spoil the experience if/when you get the chance to go. I will say a few things, however:- DO NOT take pictures. I know, this is a really stupid thing to say because they'll have it posted everywhere. But I was that one person that took pictures at dinner and made a dining magician angry at me. So no pictures inside of the castle, if you don't want to be yelled at like a naughty child. - It is totally worth waiting for the Close-Up Gallery. Check the times on the pamphlet you receive at the door and plan your time accordingly. As soon as we finished the headlining show at the Palace of Mystery, we made a beeline upstairs to the Close-Up Gallery line and got great seats. If I remember correctly, the theatre seats less than if not around 20. Out of the three shows I saw that night, this one impressed us all the most!- The food is tasty, but not anything remarkable. Standard steakhouse fare such as prime rib, salmon, frites, garlic bread, etc. All of it is richly flavored (read: butter-laden) but delicious. Yes, the price is high--but when you think about the magicians and the experience of being at the Magic Castle itself, the price is negligible compared to the experience.- If you sit in the front, you are volunteering yourself as a participant in the show. Out of my group of 6, 3 of us were either called on stage or used as a talking point. Honestly, if you don't mind the attention, it makes the shows that much more engaging and enjoyable! - Ties are absolutely mandatory for gents, and they actually have a few at the front concierge in case people forget to bring their own. - Make sure you enunciate your song requests to Irma the Piano Ghost clearly. Her catalog is quite impressive!  The staff here is incredibly professional and nice, and they all have a very wry sense of humor. The decor is fascinating--you'll never get tired of looking around, whether you're waiting in line or enjoying a drink. If you have the connections and resources to visit The Magic Castle, I would say this is a MUST VISIT attraction for Los Angeles--whether you live here or you're visiting! Keep an open mind and get ready for one of the most entertaining ways to spend your night in the city.",5 star rating
1139,7/2/2013,"Privilege Privilege Privilege... that's what going to the Magic Castle is!My goodness I could truly use all 5000 characters telling you about this cool place that makes one feel like a kid again... but professionally and tactfully.Yes you do need to be either a MC member or a guest of a MC member to dine here.The first thing you need to know if you are going here is that you're going to want to check out their website! They have a pretty strict dress code that you must adhere to in order to gain entrance. Also... if you're driving then it is all valet. These aren't bad things... just a heads up... after all.... it's only one magical night!They have various dining times which are available to check out on their website. This is because when you go to this magical place if you'd like then you are treated to various types of magic shows from close up magic to well who knows (you really do because if you look at the website you can see who the performers are and do a little research on them.)Birthdays (especially with multiple people) prove especially fun, so you can share in the joy.In the main bar hangs out their ""resident ghost"" Irma with whom you can ask to play any song you'd like and she'll start playing it on her piano. It's very cool. I asked her to play ""Paint it Black"" by the Rolling Stones and she totally did and right away. It was amazing. I don't know if she knows uber-current songs or not... guess you'll have to find out. Irma does love tipping and that definitely helps getting your song played. A little tip... Ask Irma ""what the saddest song ever written is"" The response is rather humorous. There are other little tricks in the bar, but I don't want to spoil everything for you.While the food proves to be very good trust me when I tell you that this is not a destination for Foodies. I don't say that in a bad way. I say that because when you look at the price at the end of the night you can't look at it as how much you paid for your meal so much as how much you've paid for your whole experience.There are many many bars here so if you want to get your drank on then you are definitely in good hands... heck even the shows have Cocktail Servers!Normally the MC is 21+ with the exception being on Saturdays and Sundays for Brunch.In addition to the price of your food (which I believe has a minimum) there is also a show fee per person that can be waived if a member is present with you.To help keep things secretive and mysterious the MC does not allow cameras inside...yes that means even the one on your phone. You're more than welcome to snap shots outside... just not inside.If I could afford it then I'd probably be here every week as it is so fun!",5 star rating
1140,1/18/2011,"One of my best friends got a one month Open Sesame membership to the Magic Castle for her birthday.  I went with her twice, and based on those two experiences can firmly say the place is hit or miss.The venue is worth checking out if you have the opportunity.  I like the set-up - once you go in, you say ""Open Sesame"" to an owl statuette, and a mock bookcase swings open.  The castle is split into several rooms, with a couple bars and plenty of places to lounge and sit.  A ghost pianist entertains in a downstairs room, taking requests ranging from Christmas songs to Bohemian Rhapsody.  The decor is a mix of classic and goofy - dark wood and old carpeting, with hundreds of photographs of hammy magicians on the walls.  I like that the formal dress code keeps the place feeling fancy.Even so, my first visit left me feeling like I had taken $28 and lit them on fire.  I paid the guest cover of $20 and guest valet of $8.  It was a Monday night, and we arrived some time after ten o'clock.  I was expecting to catch at least one show in the main room, and my friends and I waited patiently for it to start.  When the time came, no one came to tell us that it was canceled.  We had to sniff it out for ourselves.  We then caught a show in one of the side rooms that was positively lame.  I felt like I was at an eight-year-old's birthday party.  The magician was introduced as someone who ""combines magic and performance art.""  I wanted to shout, ""OH.  You mean he's a magician and not a wizard?""I was so annoyed with my experience that I actually complained to the manager.  He didn't offer a refund, which I think should be the policy when guests are allowed in late to find canceled shows.  Instead he looked for a VIP pass.  He'd run out, though, so he told me vaguely that if I came in again, and if he were working that day, my cover would be waived.  He was nice about it, but unhelpful.  To cap it all off, the girl working the front was pretty bitchy.My second visit was worlds better than the first.  I went with a bigger group of people, and this time my friend used her one free pass on me.  Member valet was a saner $3.  This time we went a little before eight and stayed until near closing and took in a lot of magic.  We watched one show in the same side room as my first time, and while it was still kind of cheesy at times, it was much better.  The magician picked a bunch of volunteers - all Asian, interestingly enough - and had them draw on pieces of paper.  He then guessed who had drawn what and even reproduced one drawing, which was cool and eerie.  We also enjoyed the magic going on throughout the castle.  The card tricks and other table magic were really remarkable, and definitely more impressive than what I saw on stage the first night.I almost wrote the Magic Castle off forever when we were turned away from a showing of the main show, then almost turned away from the last one of the night.  Turns out, all diners at the Castle get tickets to these shows included in their meals, and in order to make it in without spending a ton on mediocre food is to be one of the first people in line.  We just made the cut-off, but many people were turned away while diners strolled in.I'm glad we made it.  The show was a riot, with three talented acts performing back to back.  One of them was that Pendragon guy who went to jail for assaulting his wife.  We saw him saw his assistant in half in clear boxes.  I'd never seen that trick done live, and it was actually mind-boggling.  After that show, I was happy I'd given the place another chance.As it turned out, the manager from the last time was there, and I tracked him down late in the evening.  He had VIP passes on him this time and gave me one, which I may or may not use.  It gives me and guests free entry into the Castle provided that I make a dinner reservation.  I don't think I want to pay for dinner here.  I haven't tried the food, but the wine they have at the bar is actively bad.I think I may have reached my peak enjoyment of the Magic Castle anyway.  While entertaining, the magic does seem to be a bit repetitive.  In two visits, I've seen the newspaper ripping trick at least three times, and the string cutting trick at least four or five.  Still, I had a great time on my second visit, and if you're interested in a fun night of magic, I suggest you seek out a member and check this place out.",3 star rating
1141,5/27/2014,"I went to the Magic Castle this past weekend. I really didn't know what to expect. In fact, I never even heard about it until two weeks ago. When I asked friends if they'd ever been, most of them who said yes said it had been a long time since they'd been and hadn't much memory about the place. All I knew going into this place was that the dress code was super strict and the group I went with made sure to insist on not going outside of the recommended dress code or they wouldn't let me in. I thought, wow, really? Well, my experience of the Magic Castle was great! It's not a place for kids, but a great place to let your thoughts wonder and be impressed on people's years of repetitive focus on one skill, astonish their audience. It was neat that there were ""ghost"" stories of the different rooms and how if you stood in a certain place at a certain time you could hear and maybe see things... that was trippy! I didn't see anything but was in awh about the stories that were being told and the magic tricks that were being performed. Seriously would recommend this place for a ""different"" type of evening. Very fun, unexpected adventure and very much appreciated talent all around the castle.",5 star rating
1142,5/31/2013,"It's amazing how one experience can turn a whole entertaining night sour. Don't get me wrong, 90% of the magicians here are AMAZING and fun to watch. Bravo magicians/illusionists... Bravo Bravo. That being said, this review is solely directed to the bartender that is desperate for money. She shamelessly demanded more money like a 3rd world minimum wage hooker. I'm the type of guy that thinks people deserve what they earn. For instance, when a Las Vegas taxi driver goes the extra mile to entertain you with stories just to make sure you have a good time instead of just driving silently, they deserve more. When a maid gives you the extra care you didn't ask for to clean up your hotel room, they deserve more.... HOWEVER, when a bartender w/ no particular customer service demands more money because they think whiskey on ice drinks are financially hard to make, they deserve to be fired. Managers of this Magic Castle, please use your magic employment power and get rid of this old desperate bartender. You can hire one that is much younger, better-looking, and most importantly know how to have manners in such establishment. Thank you.",2 star rating

1144,7/8/2006,"Cool cool cool. And I don't even like magic! It's definitely an experience coming here and something that's not to be missed.Two thoughts...Plan on spending more money than you expected here. It's kinda like Disneyland, you know a coke shouldn't be $134 dollars, but screw it, it's Disneyland. The Magic Castle is similiar to that.Don't order the steak unless you don't mind spending waaay too much for an average meal. I think it was over $40 for what I considered a pretty sub par steak and for that kinda money you could go to JAR and really make your meat senses tingle.All in all, it's a great chance to get all gussied up and have fun with some friends or the person you're banging, so enjoy it, ya only live once!",4 star rating
1145,2/16/2014,"Make dinner reservations the food is tasty! The filet oscar special was cooked to perfection and the garlic mashed potatoes are comfort food at its best! Caesar salad was a bit over the top with anchovy, I think they put them on it then took them off. Just to salty, we it was good. Other guests at my table ordered prime rib and said it was perfect. Rack of lamb and was thrilled. Say away from the spell binder wine it's made with headache grapes. Go for the Pinot Noir! If you have a food allergy, they are really good and protective to be sure they understand what can and can't be cooked together. To my surprise it is accessible but only some of the floors which I am absolutely thrilled about. Since I know a few people that would love it! And they are easy going to go along and enjoy it! The shows: have dinner get the golden ticket to the main show! I've seen two main shows and both were fabulous! The parlor is fun too. However both times I have been here, I've found random up close magicians not on the program that stole the show! ( glad it wasn't my watch!, they are that good) Great for a date! Great time to talk between shows and wandering around the grounds. The security guard Joey was polite, friendly and so helpful!",5 star rating
1146,2/22/2014,"Had the pleasure of going to the Magic Castle the other night, and right off the bat we were denied entry because my bf was wearing his ""fakey dress shoes"" (Cole Haans with flywire). Let this serve as a warning...they are SERIOUS about the dress code!! The bouncer told him he'd have to wear loaners (didn't know they had any) and that they were really ugly brown numbers. He ended up changing into a spare pair he had in his trunk, and the bouncer winked at me conspiratorially that I'd much have preferred he rock the loaners. I opted to go more casual myself with a day dress and some flats and felt sorely underdressed when I saw ladies in full evening attire.Dress code aside, we were granted access and with an ""open sesame"" to the little owl we entered a sprawling room with a bar crowded by guests. Had the pleasure of watching a gentleman do some tricks randomly to the side of the bar. That's the beauty of the joint, it's crawling with magicians who love to show you their tricks. He had an arsenal of card tricks that oohed and ahhed us until it was time for dinner.A place like the Magic Castle doesn't particularly scream ""good eats"" to me, so I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of our meal. Shrimp cocktail, calamari, truffled fries, cheesy garlic bread were all great starters to the meal. I opted for the rack of lamb, which was a generous portion of chops cooked wonderfully and was very tender and juicy. The banana creme pie and coffee were nice finishers for the meal, only we were whisked off to catch the big show. Probably should go for an earlier dinner seating than 9 if you want to get a more full experience.The big show was a delight. The host magician came out and did a few bits, then he segued into the two other acts. We had the pleasure of witnessing the ball trick, the rope trick, and the rings from our host. The first guest magician was the balloon man, who did some very entertaining things with a very large balloon. Then the host came back out and had some fun with a sword and a very rambunctious audience member. He also pointed out a lady that had a ballerina pink dress and a feather muff for a purse. The final magician was a true delight, making doves appear out of blazing scarves, and turning them into a dog!! After the show we were able to get back down to business and watch close-up magic shows to our hearts' content. Pretty cool way to spend a Thursday night.",4 star rating

1150,1/14/2015,"I want to be clear that my experience at the Magic Castle was fantastic- the place was clean, amazing, great friendly, knowledgeable staff, really a magical experience. The only reason I'm writing a review (or giving it 3 stars), is because I heard that this was one of the top restaurants in LA. Yes, the food was good and the service was ok, but after hearing that this was top on LA's list, I had to interject:I was in last week and my server was Richard. He was friendly, knew about the menu and added the additional charisma and character that makes good experiences. That being said:We weren't drinking wine. Our wine glasses stayed on our table until about halfway through the meal, when a bus boy noticed and took them away for us (i had asked if they could remove mine earlier to make room, and they only took mine. The other 5 we had collected at the end of the table hoping someone would notice). They were in our way and cluttering the table. He should have removed them once he found out that we would not be using them. We had two people drinking soda at the table. Not only did we have to ask for refills ourselves (empty glasses for close to 10 minutes at a time before we finally asked for refills), but he forgot to bring them a total of three times. Two guests were without drinks for a total of almost half the meal in between asking and having to re-ask about refills. When we all had ordered, my friend's prime rib had been turned into salmon- he corrected himself, but when he brought our dishes, he had forgotten to switch out one of his sides like he had asked. So the service was just that- Ok at best. If I had been at a mediocre restaurant, I wouldn't have batted an eyelash, but hearing that this was one of the top restaurants made me laugh. I have been to many four star restaurants in the states, a few michelin star restaurants in Europe and had I been bringing out of town guests, I would have been embarassed. Such tiny mistakes but they make such a big difference.  Only in regards to the service. Everything else (including the food) was great.I will definitely go back again, I will just have to have lower service expectations.",3 star rating

Now, for the entertainment, I was able to see some very talented performers. The most memorable moment was from a gentleman, Micah the Magician.

1153,10/17/2010,"It's been over 20 years since I've been to the Magic Castle.  One of my friends won a pass for 4 from an auction.  So I was stoked when she had asked me to go with her and a couple of other friends.  The pass only included the admission and required that we had dinner at the Castle.  Otherwise you can only get into the MC with a member.  Surprisingly the restaurant is very good.   There are 3 seating times.  Our reservations was the last seating at 9:45.  But they did seat us early @ 9:30.We started off with the portabello fries and fried calamari to share.  The fries came with a soy dipping sauce, and the calamari came with a slightly spicy chipotle dipping sauce.  The calamari was good, had better had worse.  The portabello fries were great!I had the lobster bisque.  It was rich and creamy.  It came served with MC written in cream in the bisque.  Nice touch.3 of us ordered the prime rib, which came with garlic bree cheese mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables.  And my other friend ordered the salmon, substituting the risotto that came with it with the mashed potatoes, and it also came with mixed veggies.The prime rib was very good.  Not Lawry's quality, but very good.  It came with horseradish on the side and au jus.  The garlic bree mashed potatoes were heavenly.  The steamed veggies were cooked perfectly.  Not overcooked.  It was a mix of carrots, yellow squash and zucchini.We had a couple of bottles of house red.  It was decent and definitely drinkable.For dessert we shared the decadent dark chocolate cake, creme brulee, and bread pudding with chocolate chips.  All 3 were outstanding.  My favorite in order was the dark chocolate cake and the bread pudding.I told a joke to our waiter, which I can't repeat here.  But he appreciated it so much he brought me a Bailey's Irish cream on the house!As for the Magic Castle, there's 3 different show rooms, the Palace of Mystery, Parlour of Prestidigitation, and the Close-up Gallery.  Make sure you have time to visit all 3.  And there's also magicians working at the various bars throughout the Castle.  My favorite magicians the evening we went were Bill Joslin and Pop Haydn.  We were fortunate to see both these talented magicians up close...like right in front of them.  Bill was an older magician, who told funny interesting stories of Old Hollywood.  Pop Haydn performed at one of the bars.  He was so polished, funny and a great magician.  Both very entertaining magicians.Be sure to catch Irma.  The mysterious ghost piano player.  She'll play your requests. MC requires a formal dress attire so be sure to check out their website for the requirements.The Magic Castle still has it's ABRACADABRA after all these years.Bring cash for valet, which is $8.",5 star rating

1157,2/3/2014,"4 stars for the magic shows.  3 stars for the brunch buffet.So I took my in-laws and wife to the Magic Castle after booking months in advance.  There was a slight hiccup in our plans when I found out that my original Saturday night reservation for 6 had to be rescheduled for Saturday brunch, because I did not realize that minors under 21 were not allowed for night shows...only allowed for Saturday/Sunday brunch shows.  Since our visit was mainly to entertain the 9-year nephew, I was lucky to reschedule from Sat evening to brunch with the phone reservations desk.Upon arriving at the Castle, we watched the Close Up Gallery at noon, then the Parlour of Prestidigation at 12:15 pm, then had brunch at 12:30, and then the Palace of Mystery at 1:45.  This schedule worked perfectly.  Also, the magic shows progressed from amateur to professional, since a 14-year old magician performed at the 1st show, then a much older (retired?) magician performed at the Parlour, and finally the middle-aged professionals close out for us at the Palace, so it was a good sequence of shows starting with amateur, then old school, then ending with prime time.  The best performer was definitely Chris Hart who performed his signature glove hand trick.  I remember this guy from long time ago when I watched him on a made-for-TV magic show.  He looks like an older Taylor Hicks from American Idol.  Also, he played the hand ""The Thing"" in the Adams Family movies.For the brunch buffet, the $37/per person is way too high for the quality and selection of food offered, but I realize this is the price you pay for the total experience.  Without the meal requirement, how else would the establishment pay all its staff and magicians with only a $15 per person cover charge?  The brunch buffet menu:  scrambled eggs and sausage/bacon station, prime rib station, smoked salmon/bagels/cream cheese, tuna sashimi, cocktail shrimp cups, enchiladas, made-to-order omelettes, beef ribs, small salad bar, whitefish, vanilla ice cream, bread pudding, small cheesecake cups, fruit salad, cookies.  Free champagne or mimosas.  Nothing really stood out except the shrimp cocktails.  Also, the buffet stations area is really tiny.  Be prepared to bump shoulders and elbow with others.There wasn't a huge crowd mainly due to it being Super Bowl weekend, so we were'nt waiting in line which was a positive.  I can imagine this place being packed like sardines on a weekend night.  Also, the daytime shows are more family-oriented since only kids are allowed to sit at the front 2 rows of the shows.  I can assume the night time shows are much more risque and edgier!",4 star rating
1158,12/7/2009,"My visit to the Magic Castle was 20 years in the making! I still remember the day I drove by it for the first time as a child. I recall the adults in the car telling me I couldn't go because it was for Magicians and their guests only. I realized then that unless I was diagnosed with Leukemia, on my deathbed and making a request with the Make a Wish Foundation that I wouldn't get to see the inside of the Magic Castle anytime soon!Now, as an adult, I was waiting. Patiently hoping, that somehow I would get invited and finally an opportunity presented itself. I put on my black cocktail dress and 5 inch black patent leather closed toe stilettos, grabbed my shawl and I was ready for a night of magic! (Dress Code is strictly enforced and valet parking is $8) We arrived a half hour before our dinner reservations and had drinks in the bar until we were shown to our table. The Magician who had invited us had graciously brought two bottles of wine for us to enjoy from his private selection. If you have the option to not have dinner here I highly recommend you don't. Although the staff was raving about the ""new menu"" that was revealed a few days earlier my New York strip steak was pitiful. I understand fully that I'm paying for the experience, but I wish I had just stuck to soup and salad or tried the lobster mac and cheese with a side of creamed spinach instead. If you've got $30 and want steak go to real steakhouse or maybe even sizzler might be a better option. The food is definitely not magical. The headliner in the main room was the guy who was voted Magician of the year. The place was crowded because so many people had come to see this guy. Even Teller of Penn and Teller was there and I can attest to the fact that he is NOT mute! The highlight for me was seeing the Cardfather tucked away behind a bar and getting to see him perform.I was told the Magic Castle is 30,000 square feet. It sure didn't feel that way because a few of the bars we visited, the hallways we walked through and a few of the stairwells were so tiny I was getting a little claustrophobic.I enjoyed my visit and I look forward to returning to the magic castle and seeing more magic, but I'll stick to appetizers and sides and avoid the entrees.",4 star rating
1159,9/11/2008,"This review is only for the Weekend Brunch.The only time you're able to bring kids here is Saturday and Sunday for Brunch. All other times this place is geared more toward adults.It definitely makes you feel and act like a kid at a carnival. First you buy a ticket to get inside (the $15 entrance fee, with no members in your group). Then you walk around the place ... admiring everything before committing to a ride (deciding which magic show to see). Then you gorge yourself on expensive carnival food that you regret eating later (the $35 Brunch buffet). And trying to grab a spot on one last ride so you'll get your money's worth before they kick you out (the magic show after you eat). That was pretty much our experience at Magic Castle.The magic shows were hilarious and fascinating. The buffet was meh....  The price was definitely over the top, but also worth it. If you get a chance, stop by this place for a unique experience you definitely won't forget.P.S. Valet parking: $8 for nonmembers, $3 for members. Carpool people!!!",4 star rating

1163,10/7/2010,"A night not too long ago was a magical night, a night of mystery + wonder as I found myself as I found myself exploring dimly lit hallways + rooms yelp.com/biz_photos/qmyT… of a castle-like mansion over 100 years old. Around nearly every corner there seemed to be magic... a glowing button on a wall almost summoning a curious finger to push it, unsuspecting walls that shifted to reveal hidden doorways, aged portraits with eyes that seemed to wander more than they should, a mysterious dark phone booth, or a magician performing tricks to rouse awe + applause from his audiences.    BEHOLD! This *insert dramatic pause here* was the Magic Castle.I pulled up the hill to the valet + stepped out onto the stone ground in my little black cocktail dress as the sun was setting on a weekday evening for an exclusive USC alumni event. We paid our $8 then proceeded into the entryway yelp.com/biz_photos/qmyT… where, after checking in, we spoke to an owl on a bookshelf who granted us access to the castle. We followed along to our private event down in the Inner Circle chambers + W.C. Fields Bar downstairs. There, we munched on unmemorable morsels of bruchetta, shrimp skewers + grilled chicken breast skewers while treated to 2 private shows of oooh's + aaah's before being released to wander the Magic Castle for the remaining few hours.  More crowded than we'd expected, we were lucky to squeeze into 5 shows:  - Robin Wiley, who performed mostly card + rope tricks   - David Zirbel, whose magic included ""sawing"" a woman in 2   - J. Neal + Liane, who did tricks of allusion with newspapers, rings, ribbons + more to accompanying music  - Toto, from Japan who did vanishing + levitation acts with cards, coins + pens  - David Gabbay, an unscheduled magician specializing in table card tricksWhile we did not have nearly enough time to see all the ongoing shows in the castle, these 5 shows were diverse + talented enough in skill sets to leave us in awe every time. We saw right before our eyes a newspaper shredded to pieces + then revealed as whole, a solid metal coin grow to 10x its size then shrink, yards upon yards of ribbon spontaneous regurgitated, a woman enclosed in a box that was stabbed + split but survived, plus many marked cards shuffled + suddenly appear again at a flick of the wrist... It was the wee hours by the time we left, enchanted by the wonders of the Magic Castle From the words of J. Neal:""The Castle is like a museum; there's lots of relics and antiques,             each walking around with a deck of cards""But truly it's more than just card tricks! As noted, no photos as allowed in the castle... but being me, of course, I snuck a couple quick ones when I could be discreet anyways. In the bathrooms is the only place inside you can easily snap a photo. yelp.com/biz_photos/qmyT…   =PPerhaps another trip to this exclusive castle will be in my future so that I have the full experience including dinner in the richly decorated dining rooms yelp.com/biz_photos/qmyT… + more time to explore the hidden secrets + dim lit passageways... Until then, 4.5 stars rounded down.",4 star rating

1165,1/20/2014,"GETTING IN - You have to know someone, a member, who can get you a guest pass or you can become a member.  Usually the guest passes get you and up to 8 other people in for one night.  You can also make dinner reservations, but call at least a month in advance!! I called a month in advance and still had to choose a Sunday night seating instead of Saturday.  They have a 6 pm, 8:30pm and 9pm seating I think for both nights.  You have to pay a $30 cover per person to come in and valet is $10.  I didn't even bother looking for street parking, but valet is easiest and you can pay for it all at once when you go inside.You have to wear a jacket for guys and nice dresses or skirts.  Guys have to keep their jacket on all night.ATMOSPHERE: The outside looks like a big victorian type castle.  When you come and give the valet your car there's a red carpet and magic castle banner where you can take pictures, and I suggest you do because once you go inside there is NO photography so for girls who want to show off your outfits, take all the pics in the very front or in the lobby near the bookcase.As soon as you pay you go inside and see the bar.  If you go early you can get a tour but we got there right as our dinner reservation seating was starting so we went straight upstairs to the dining room.  There are at least three different dining rooms and the decor is very old-style.  It's not your trendy or fake disneyland castle, you actually feel like youre inside the Beast's castle or hogwarts.  I think because of the ""magic"" aspect I felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie.  People say the castle has a lot of magical things and you should explore so I kept expecting to see moving portraits or ghosts floating or talking heads.  To be honest, there wasn't that much of that around.  Maybe I didn't have enough time to explore or maybe I was clueless.  It's easy to get lost around the castle and they don't give you a map but don't be afraid to ask people.  Members have little pins on their jackets (and they tend to be older men...) and they are very helpful.  The kind of grandpa's you see that love to tell stories about the castle or show you random magic and just love to talk.  Take advantage of that and get all the info you can!! But just remember, some of the magic shows are upstairs, past the dining hall and also downstairs past the dining hall.TIPS: Go inside of the photobooth, try to figure out what the two phrases at the bottom of the showtimes board mean (and they change), explore all the floors of the castle, go see Irma the piano (that plays whatever song you tell her to).  The hallways are kind of small and old and there's a lot of memorabilia and random stuff on the walls so just check it all out, push all buttons.DINNER: Not much to say about the food.  It's kind of expensive and mediocre.  Your typical beef, fish and sauteed veggies with some potato.  They give you complimentary bread, which was warm with butter but just your typical dinner roll.  Definitely not the highlight.  SHOWS: You get a ticket to the main show, which has a specific seating time that you have to go to but ALWAYS go early.  You think you have a ticket but for our 8:30pm showing it was almost full by the time 8:10 rolled around.  For some of the other shows like the parlour you have to get in line at least 30 minutes beforehand or you won't even get inside.  The close up gallery fills up REALLY quickly because there are only 20 or so seats so get in line when you can.  It's gonna be hard to fit every show in because of the timing but don't stress about it.  We spent a good 5 1/2 hours including dinner at the castle and still didnt see two of the shows.  One awesome thing was that we missed one show because it was at capacity and then we overheard someone saying there was a private show available in this other room.  We followed the group and found ourselves in a private magic show in a room and time that wasnt marked on the brochure! It was our favorite.  Very funny, contemporary and the magic was awesome. For a girl who doesn't like magic all that much (I came here as a birthday present for my boyfriend) I wasn't SUPER impressed with everything, and dont expect some glamorous las vegas david copperfield stuff but the close up magic was the best.  The stage stuff is kinda far removed but when the magic is being done right in front of you and you are involved, it's pretty cool.  There are random guys who do table magic around the castle so if you see them stop by or sit down and it'll be worth it.  Overall, this place was pretty cool and definitely an experience.  Yeah, it's expensive and I'm not sure if it's TOTALLY worth the money but it's a once in a lifetime thing to say you've gone.  If you or a friend like magic you will enjoy yourselves.  Just don't get caught up in the schedule and go with the flow, don't be afraid to ask questions and look for the out of place rooms and object",4 star rating
1166,8/13/2014,"Dress up ladies, suit up guys and be prepared to be entertained by Magic shows. Magic Castle is an exclusive-type event since admission to the event is by invitation only. Upon entering, grab a drink at the bar and leisurely walk around to explore the facility, making note of the magic show schedule and the rooms they are in. The 8 of us had a wonderful time walking in and out of different magic shows, some shows were held in front of larger audiences but others were in smaller rooms so you could experience the magic show up close. Dinner was delicious, no complaints. With the entrance fee, dinner, and valet parking it can be a bit expensive but it's certainly a fun, memorable night and an experience definitely worth trying.",4 star rating
1167,1/15/2013,"This was my second time visiting the Magic Castle. My first time was about 5 years ago, where I came with friends for dinner and a show. Skip the dinner and just go to the show, if you can. Luckily, I know a member and was able to get 10 friends in for free and without the mandatory dinner that most people need to have.  We came on a Sunday night to avoid the crowds one would expect on a Friday or Saturday. But for a Sunday, it was still pretty busy. Of the group, many had never visited the castle before and the general consensus was that it was a fun night and event. One person in our party had such an enjoyable experience that she even considered becoming a dues paying member and researched how to join.I like the close up performances. They are more entertaining and interactive than the larger stage shows. Close up performances are usually slight of hand tricks whereas the stage performances are usually things like cutting a woman in half and what not.Get there early to avoid the dinner crowd. The castle usually has 3 dinner times so after the 3rd dinner the place will be packed. The club is strict in terms of attire. Ladies, wear a cocktail dress. If you wear pants, make sure you bring a jacket. We saw a woman get denied for the incorrect attire. Gents dress in you favorite suit.Fun game to keep you busy: count the number of owls in the castle.",5 star rating

1169,8/17/2010,"A fabulous ""do it before you die"" experience that deserves all the stars in the world.  Open sesame...My dad was a wonderful magician in his youth, but let it fade a bit in order to focus on practicing medicine (which is certainly magical in its own right).  A few years ago, we visited LA together to check out grad schools for me, and one day just happened to drive by the Magic Castle.  It was like he was a kid again, dumbfounded that he was in the presence of the much lauded establishment for magicians, a place he had only dreamed about and read in his magic magazines.  We poked around outside, and discovered you could only enter if you were a member.......or a guest at the Magic Castle Hotel.CUT TO: 2010I'm now in school out here, living in LA full time, and my family decides to visit me for a long weekend.  Without missing a beat, my dad books a room at the Magic Castle Hotel and gets us reservations for a Saturday morning brunch, complete with three magic shows.  Three!Witnessing my dad realizing his childhood dream was beyond magical for me.  Yes, the brunch buffet was lovely, and the magic shows were brilliant and mind blowing, but watching my dad interact with Irma the piano playing ghost, and allowing him to give us all the grand tour even though he had never stepped foot in this place before, well...that was worth all the money in the world.If you have the chance to visit here, take it!!  Personally, I recommend brunch over dinner.  It's a little more casual in terms of dress code, and I think the food is better, judging by some other comments.",5 star rating

1171,4/29/2010,"21+ & by invite only. Make sure you read all the rules (esp the dress code part) off their website before attending. If you know someone, who knows someone, who knows someone, then you definitely should visit the Magic Castle so you can at least say you've experienced it. Downer: I think one of the rules of the castle is no pictures are allowed to be taken inside. Bleh.We had dinner reservations at 8pm on a Monday night. Valet was about $7 or so. Little did I know that we could've arrived earlier to check the spot out and maybe catch some extra shows. There was a $20 cover at the door for us. Sorry ladies, I don't think the cleavage spilling tops & short skirts will get you on the free guestlist. After you pay for your cover, say something like open sesame, abacadaba, peek-a-boo, abba-zabba for the hidden entrance door to slide open. Slick.There's one perk to having dinner here... You get a guaranteed ticket for the main magic show and you don't have to line up in the wait list line. That means, they will accomodate all ticket holders first then whatever seats are left, they will allow the wait list people in. If all seats are filled, you're a$$ed out.The food was decent but I wouldn't say it was ""magical."" They gave us our own room, no idea why because I saw other parties as big as ours or even bigger but it was fine, we got to be as loud as we wanted to be. Do try the portobello fries if you're looking for an app to share. It was perfectly battered and fried. Great ponzu sauce complimenting it.For my main course, I had the Shrimp Scampi. Although the shrimps were a nice size, this dish was a bit overwhelming. Quite creamy and heavy. It will definitely make you thirsty. Great for the first few bites then it quickly gets old.After dinner, we swiftly ran off to the main magic show in the Palace of Mystery. It was an entertaining 40 min program. Chairs were those foldable ones you see in the wrestling matches so they were somewhat uncomfortable and it was stuffy when the place was packed but the show was pretty good so it was worth it.Awaiting our next show, we were entertained by some magicians with card tricks. I took this window of opportunity to explore the place and just wander about. Lots to look at and many areas of the place to explore. They do provide you with a program that has times of shows, a map of the place, and useful information.Although the place closes early, I would suggest going as early as you can and map out what you're going to do. Not only did we all have work early the next morning, we just felt like we didn't have enough time. Unless you don't mind crawling into work the next morning, I may suggest trying a weekend night. It might be more packed though. For a Monday night, there were still a good amount of people in attendance. For you Alki Anonymous folks, there's about a billion bars in this place. Plus, everytime you enter a theatre, they have servers going around taking orders. You can't go dry here. BTW, check out that piano downstairs where you say the name of a track and it will play that song. I remember Lady Gaga was playing. Pretty sweet.I don't think I got to experience everything one just one visit so hopefully I will return again and try to grasp more of the Magic Castle and what it has to offer. Also, I saw Billy Dee Williams that night. For you new school kids who don't know who I'm referring to, that's Lando Calrissian from Star Wars you fool.",4 star rating

1174,1/3/2011,"My first review for 2011 is Magic Castle!  What an awesome experience!  Even though I was not a strong believer walking into the doors of Magic Castle - when I saw that the bookcase was opened by the magical words ""Open Sesame""... SO COOL! I knew that I was in for an adventure!  Usually, entertainment and dinner combinations are normally more focused on the entertainment value.  The dinner aspect of it is commonly overshadowed or food would suck.  This is not the case with Magic Castle, and I must recommend their New Zealand Lamb! Excellent!  Mine was medium rare and it was perfectly delicious!  I also highly recommend their Garlic Cheese Bread and Portobello Mushroom fries!  The Lobster Macaroni and Cheese was okay, but I don't think that it was worth $14 since it was a bit dry.  Also, I am not sure what it was - as the Calamari was standard, yet their sauce was yummier than usual.  The boyfriend had the extra large Prime Rib and was very pleased.  I am not an expert on Prime Rib, so I'm just going to take his word for it.  Tip#1: It is really important to remember to finish your dinner promptly as you need to get to the main show 15 minutes before it starts.  Because I didn't get my coffee or dessert after my meal, it was awesome to have a second opportunity to order it before the show!  The key to this adventure is timing!  Tip#2: Look at the schedule and plan to wait 30 minutes before each show. Tip#3: They are dress code Nazis here!  The bf left to use the restroom from the dining room and was stopped by an usher to injure about his ""coat's whereabouts.""  Before we left the dinner table, the waiter reminded my bf to put on his coat before he went into the showroom. They are serious!  Be sure to look over their dress code requirements on their main website!!  Tip#4: It is valet only.  Plan to spend $8 on parking plus tip afterwards.Tip#5: Parties of 8 or more, Gratuity of 18% will automatically be applied to your bill.  We had a party of 8, and since our waiter was so awesome - we added a bit more for his services!  Good service is so rare nowadays!We had a lot of fun today!  The magic was amazing, endearing, and so funny.  All the magicians that we saw today had a great sense of humor!  Although he didn't say a single thing, Dan Sperry was AMAZING!  Since it happened to be the Founder's Day, we were privileged to be in the presence of some famous people and even the Founders of Magic Castle.  Very cool.  Thumbs up!  If we are ever invited back here again, we would happily pay another visit!",5 star rating

1176,11/5/2015,"Unless you're a VIP, this place is EXPENSIVE.  $30 cover on the weekend + ~$40 for dinner (per person), to get in the big show + $20 for drinks = close to $100, per person (once tips are factored in).For $100, you get a fun experience.  You get a lot of different magic shows, and you can stay for 4-5-6 hours worth of magic, if you like.My problem is that i thought the magic was fun, but i just wanted it to be better.  I dont know - i feel like i've seen the tricks where magicians pull your card out of a deck, where a $5 is changed into a $50, where an assistant comes out of a small box (trap door, anyone?) - i just didnt see anything wildly creative/amazing.  All of the tricks, above, were just things i felt like i had seen before on TVAll that said, i like magic.  And if i could escape the cover charge, or just eat dinner before i got there, i'd definitely go again.  But just wanted it to be soooo much better.p.s. a side note - who charges $12 for a pint glass, like they did in their gift shop.  $12????????????  Does it magically print money for me?",3 star rating
1177,11/15/2008,"Holy magical smokes! If you get an invite, don't pass it up! There's a $20 entry fee and a mandatory dinner purchase, but the amazing prestidigitation you'll witness is well worth it. Food: Quite possibly the worst part of MC. Unfortunately, this food pornographer couldn't get any shots of this disaster (photos aren't allowed inside). I tried the seafood linguini which was infested with calamari rings and the nastiest red sauce ever. We also split a shrimp appetizer that was $9 and had a grand total of 6 microscopic crustaceans. Lame. Anyway, don't come here for the food. Get the cheapest thing on the menu, eat, and move on. Magic: Whoa. The show on the main stage blew me away. We came the day before Halloween so there was a spooky show where toys ""came alive."" People were dressed up in costumes and there were plenty of decorations around (yelp.com/biz_photos/qmyT…). There was an after show with a comedian and lots of dancing + alcohol. I got dragged on stage and suddenly had to hula hoop with three other girls for like 5 minutes (???). No idea what the point of that was, but it was fun. Quite possibly, the best part of the night was the show in the prestidigitation room. WEIRD CRAP went down. I am not joking. I'd pay the whole fee again just to see that one more time. Atmosphere: The dining room is like a meat locker, but the rest of the castle is full of fun. If you see a phone booth, go in it and close the door. There are a lot of hidden rooms and secret passages. Keep an eye out. Synopsis: Pretty freaking magical.

I must remember to order that dish if I ever see it on another menu. Onto the magic. I cannot express how much of a ""WOW"" factor my friend and I experienced that night. Perhaps we're just diehard Harry Pot-""heads"" and love the idea of living in a magical fantasy world, but each magician's performance just blew us away - and we'd be sitting within arms' length of him!

1179,11/20/2008,"""Open Sesame!!!""Yes, you do have to say that at this bookshelf which opens into the famous Magic Castle. Corny you think while reading this, but so amazingly fun when you are actually there!! You say it to this little owl heh.Once you are inside you are welcomed by a bar and a lounge type area. We went quickly to find one of the castle knights who gave us a tour of the castle, pointing out historical pieces and rooms, and for those of you who like entertaining, you can even rent out some of their bar rooms for private parties!! Pretty baller, right???? Granted we were here near Halloween so there were some extra corny pieces of artwork up here and there, but our knight told us that the magicians of the castle slowly just bring in their favorite magical decorations of choice, which is kinda cool.One of the highlights...IRMA!!! The ghost piano player! Yes, they have a piano that will play any song you tell it to on the spot!! My friends and I actually stumped her by giving her some modern day songs and she responded with a mean little cord!!! How rude, Irma!!! But she does play a mean Thriller, so I would suggest that one ha There are multiple theaters here so be sure when you come here to block off a good chunk of time. We got here around 5pm in order to get a tour of the castle, eat dinner (which was only so so and I kind of overpriced for what you get....BUT their sweet potato souffle thing is YUMMY so just get that if you go here ha And the Salmon isn't too bad either), and then we saw three separate main shows and one side show in the hallway since random magicians walk around here all the time!!!And now I have to give a shout out to David M. who made this review possible. He has to be one of the best magicians I have seen!!! Seeing him perform at the Magic Castle instantly made me want to go out and sign up for magic classes myself, so if any of you have a chance to him perform DO IT!! You will not regret it! His hour glass trick still has my mind boggled!! He literally turned a marble into an hour glass filled with sugar he poured into it back into a marble and the sugar packet was magically full again and resealed without him every touching it!!! I KNOW CRAZY!!!So find a hook up to come to the magic castle, because this place is invite only. You can either go to a brunch showing which is open for kids, or you can go to the adult shows at night, and they have quite a few bars spread throughout it so if you can cab it, definitely do that over driving!!! Although I don't know how I would have reacted to the amazing tricks I saw that night had I been a little tipsy!! I may have passed out!",4 star rating

They feature live performances, magic classes, a restaurant, and a few bars.Magic Castle is for members only and their guests (plus a few A-listers like me). Their Open Sesame membership package looks like a good deal. I can't tell you about the food, but they did have good beers on tap.What you come here for is the magic itself, and we caught a number of acts ranging from card and rope tricks to a mentalist duo.

They got the invitation for that day 3 months ago (i have no idea how, cause you need to know a magician who can send it to you),and had that HUGE surprise for me. It was my first time here. I wanted to come here for the last 6 years,but never did. I am so happy we finally went. It is nothing like you ever experience before. It is really big,huge, unique old castle, with many rooms, bars,magicians, and restaurant. Every one dressed so elegant, cause they have very restrict dress code, and i think that how it should be. We had dinner there, which was just PERFECT! Everything was so delicious ,so good, so tasty, that we really enjoyed our dinner. My daughter had the special steak they have,which costs $72 i think, but she said it was the best steak she ever had in her life!! And believe me, she is eating steaks everywhere.... After dinner,you get the tickets for the main show from the waiter. What can i tell you??? It was so AMAZING, so unbelievable, that you can not explain, and we sat at the first row in all the shows we went. There are many rooms, with magicians, and you are just walking from one room to another. AMAZING.... I have no doubt in my mind they are bringing the best magicians ever! Even though we sat sooo close to the magicians, we could not tell how they did ,what they did... It was just a unique entertaining magical evening. One of the best i have ever had in my life!",5 star rating
1188,9/17/2013,"So I'm looking up reviews on Yelp,  and at the bottom of the page I see various listing of reviews...  One of which  was the Magic Castle,  and I immediately smack myself in on my forehead...  Why have I NOT  written a review for the Magic Castle...?!?! I've only been going to the Castle since I  was 11 years old when my dad joined as a magical member...  (FYI minors under the age of 21 are only allowed in for Sunday Brunch).  I couldn't wait until I was 21 so that I could experience the MC as an adult! And was definitely worth the wait.  If you can find member to give you a guest pass,  or allow you to accompany them to the Castle,  you will truly be in for a  treat.  The beautiful Magic Castle showcases some of the best stage and  close up magicians,  illusionists,  mentalist,  and slight of hand performers around.  It is th e headquarters of Magic,  and Magic is EVERYWHERE  at this place. Not only are the performances amazing  (my favorite is the Close Up Gallery),  but the food is incredible! The beef wellington would bring even Gordon Ramsay to sing the chefs praises! I  took my cousin who was visiting from FL a year ago to the MC,  and she text me this week saying she still thinks about the Beef Wellington,  and can't wait to go back! Even if you don't get a chance to have dinner  (reservations fill up quickly),  you still can have a  satisfying meal with their delicious bar food.  The Magic Castle burger is out of this world.  And no trip to the Magic Castle is complete without heading over to visit Irma in her piano room.  She's a very talented pianist who delivers exceptional live music while you wait for your friends or reservations,  or just to have a drink...  And yes, she does take requests... LOL Also,  if you ever have the opportunity to do so,  try the Harry Houdini Séance... My dad did it for his birthday a few years ago,  and we all had an unforgettable time! I  truly hope that you all get to experience this amazing place! (but leave your camera at home...  There is a  strict no photos policy that is enforced.  But don't worry,  your memories at the Castle can still be documented,  as thier official photographer makes his way through the castle to take your picture...)",5 star rating
1189,5/18/2009,"My visit to the Magic Castle to celebrate a friend's birthday was enjoyable for the most part. It's a good excuse to get all glammed up in dresses and suits. The experience itself was different and glamorous for the first hour. The reason I say this place was enjoyable for the first hour was because it was pretty much the same stuff after a while. However, I was amazed by the feelings it gave me during our tour (old, historic, magical, mysterious, glamorous).The magic shows themselves were very entertaining. The magicians really did impress me. I forced myself to not have any expectations, so that really helped me enjoy the night. The magicians knew how to have a good time and even make us laugh with their cheesy jokes (I'm easily amused). The one thing that annoyed me the most was the long wait for each show. I don't mind if I have to wait for 30-45 minutes if the magic shows themselves were longer, but I swear 2 of the shows that we waited for lasted no longer than 15 minutes. Drinks were more on the expensive side, but I figure it's the same price you would pay at a nightclub. I paid about $32 for a pint of beer, a long island, and a jager redbull. I don't think I'd come here again, but it wasn't like this place was BAD. Just an experience you need to do only once.OH and another suggestion, don't come here in a big group. We had about 13 people with us and it's difficult to see shows all together (even though we managed). Walking around the halls with a big group is a pain to the other patrons who have to wait until our group passes through. And finally, don't forget to visit the ghost, Irma. She'll play you songs by request. But don't forget to tip the birdy!",3 star rating
1190,10/21/2016,Exceptional food and incredible magic. Would love to take photos but their no-pictures policy makes it more special. Love dressing up since there are not many places in LA that have a dress code. Early in the week is better and less crowded. If you are lucky enough to score an invite from a Magic Castle member go for it. The Magic Castle is a true Hollywood treasure.,5 star rating
1191,6/6/2013,"Had a fantastic night here last weekend, thanks to Soo H! ;D I came with my boyfriend and his family and we all left feeling wonderfully inspired and in awe. I even went home and googled some tricks, but quickly learned that I am much more suited to spectate instead!For dinner I had a filet mignon which was accompanied by some creamy mashed potatoes and colorful vegetables, that reminded me of wildflowers. They dyed cauliflowers purple and yellow and I just remember it being a nice little touch.The steak was cooked to my liking and the mash potatoes were tasty. Everyone enjoyed dinner and we left the table feeling satisfied. Service was prompt and our server was great. With dinner we received tickets to an 8:30 show.We explored the castle a bit before watching two shows, one was with Johnathan Pendragon and the second show was with an extremely witty young man who kept referring to himself as the caramel lad (his name escapes me at the moment), but he was awesome! Both shows were greatly entertaining and I left with my mind blown and my jaw slightly ajar. The castle's ambiance was dim and even a bit spooky, filled with tons of memorabilia in ornate frames. Certain portraits even made me feel a bit uneasy with the roaming eyes. Oh! And check out the phone booth :)I loved that they have a little photo area set up in the front with the red carpet and all- cause they don't allow photography once inside.I didn't really know what to expect, but my expectations were high from all the hype about this place, and the Magic Castle didn't disappoint! The staff are friendly and extremely accommodating as well. Only thing I would say is to line up early to see the shows cause it fills up fast- possibly cause it was a weekend? Don't forget to visit Irma the pianist, and put in a song request!Overall, I loved the experience and enjoyed the opportunity to dress up. And yes, it was worth the trouble of putting on some falsies!",5 star rating

1193,8/23/2016,"I love going to the Magic Castle, and I try to get there any time I'm in LA.  It helps to know a member to secure a reservation, especially on busy nights, but once you're in, there is no better way to spend an evening.  Valet parking is always appreciated, and it's no more expensive than anywhere else as far as that goes.  The dress code is strict, but that is a good thing, as it helps set the mood.  And what can I say about the entertainment that hasn't already been said a thousand times?  It's amazing.  I have come on quiet nights, as well as busy ones and the formal shows as well as the magic happening at the bars, and in corners around the house have always made for a great night.  I have never had a bad time here, and I welcome the chance to go back whenever I can.",5 star rating
1194,3/17/2014,"Thanks to a friend we got an invite to the magic castle. The experience was amazing one. We definitely got to see some up close magic going on! We were able to fit in 3 shows and a few side shows in our 5 hours we were there. There were many bars around and that you could drink at, as well as the restaurant. The food to myself was okay. If I was to rate only the food, I would give it 3 stars for the price we were paying. I had the 21 day aged bone in ribeye steak and it was not my favorite but cooked well and was tasty. We also had the banana creme pie and it was alright. Their customer service was amazing. We had a few things wrong and they fixed it right away and did not seem to have any qualms about us complaining. I know a lot of people talk about how expensive it is, but I think that for night out on the town, plus a show and drinks, it was what you would get anywhere.$30 entrance few$75 -rib eye, banana creme pie, Malibu on the rocks $10 valet Definitely would come again, but maybe think about eating off the bar menu.",4 star rating
1195,9/19/2008,"I had been dating a guy a few months when all of a sudden the most awkward day in a young relationship popped up-- Valentine's Day. I get a call from him inviting me to a romantic Valentine's dinner which I happily accepted with a ton of excitement. He wouldn't tell me where we were going but insisted that I needed to dress to the tee for an upscale, exclusive evening on the town. Being a girl who doesn't like to shop (yes we do exist) and owns very few dresses, I freaked and spent two weeks trying to find the perfect dress for this special evening. Needless to say it was stressful. Finally the big night arrived and he picked me up and brought me.. HERE. Yes, he brought me to the Magic Castle, perhaps the most unromantic place on the planet. I was horrified. It took a few glasses of wine for the shock to wear off. We ate some old school, non adventurous food in the restaurant which was expensive and boring. Then we moved on the magic tricks. OK, so they were mildly amusing as was the piano that played by itself but come on! Why do people come here? I realize I'm a disgruntled girl who was unhappy about purchasing a dress to come here but I've been back since and still.. Is it because its ""exclusive"" and hard to get into???

1196,8/9/2015,"Definitely a unique place. Magic, food, alcohol, music... it's an adult oddity, in a very good way!!! You either need to be a member or receive an invitation to enter. No photography allowed. There is a main magic show in the big room, which is hard to get in unless you're first in line or if you eat dinner via reservation in which you will receive a ticket. We saw 4 shows in 1 night, all were amazing. Guys must wear suits, women wear dresses or slacks. Definitely a unique experience and will definitely go back!!!!",5 star rating
1197,5/26/2014,"This is definitely a place you have to check out at least once. Lots of rules and a little expensive, but pretty entertaining. Even though my friend had a guest pass entrance is still $30 each, plus $13 for valet, then whatever you spend on a required dinner. It happened to be Japan Week when our party of 6 visited. Even though our dinner reservation was at 8pm, we decided to arrive early to see some of the smaller shows. Make sure you grab a schedule when you check in and plan accordingly. We were able to catch a close-up show at 6:15pm, but were unable to get into the 7:15pm, which was fine because it gave us some time to get drinks and explore the castle. After some dead end hallways, several trips up and down some stairs, and a celebrity sighting of Chris Colfer from Glee, we ended up next to Irma, the invisible piano player, and requested some songs. For dinner all the girls ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and all the guys ordered the bone-in ribeye. Based on previous reviews I was not expecting the food to be any good, but I thought my seabass was absolutely delicious! It was a good portion and I even asked for extra sauce because it was so yummy! It was served with a potato au gratin and some steamed green vegetables which were just okay. My husband thought his medium ribeye was a bit undercooked, but the flavor was amazing and it was very tender. For dessert we tried the banana cream pie with a side of vanilla bean ice cream, which was good, but not something I would recommend. Our 8pm show consisted of two Japanese performers, who were cute and had a couple good magic tricks, but after awhile it started to get a little cheesy for me. I don't know if it's because there was somewhat of a language barrier, but maybe Japanese humor is somewhat lost on me. My husband and my friend's boyfriend participated in the show, which made it much more entertaining. We caught another close-up show afterwards, which I thought had the best performer because she had some really good coin tricks. Overall, I'm glad we arrived early so that we could catch some of the other shows and make the most it. Make sure you read the dress code. If you are prepared, you'll have a much better time.",4 star rating
1198,3/27/2015,"I have never been here nor will I ever go due to the lack of sympathy this company had for a terminally ill child. My sister who is a pediatrics oncology nurse raised money to send her dying 16 year old patient to see a show here for her 16th birthday. Though she did not have a member to invite her my sister called and asked to speak to a manager to explain the situation and They proceeded to tell her that Sh would have to find a member to invite her and then it would cost her family $20 per person to just get in and then another $40 per person to have brunch.  At the end of the very disappointing conversation, the woman said, ""oh and there is a $13 parking fee.""  Long story short, Camille never made it to The Magic Castle.  She became very ill and then passed away on March 21.  I personally donated $100  to her cause to go to the magic castle and since they were so unaccommodating she then passed and that money is now going to help with burial costs. You should be ashamed of yourself  The Magic Castle for not being a more charitable institution in Los Angeles.  You could have been apart of something amazing in giving a dying child one last laugh!

1199,9/4/2011,"*250th Review*In celebration of this magical moment (har har), I decided to make my 250th review of the Magic Castle.Who doesn't like magic?  A classmate of mine got an invite so he invited 7 more of us to join him for an evening of fine dining and entertainment.The castle is tucked away on a backroad of Hollywood...I've probably driven by it a million times but never noticed.We waited for everyone to arrive and then went on in.  Sadly there is no photography allowed but I was able to snap a few in front and inside the first room.The whole experience felt very old Hollywood.  After wandering around and having our minds blown we finally got to eat...2 drinks in on an empty stomach...I was enjoying myself.We ordered a bunch of appetizers...portobello fries, sweet corn dumplings, cheesy garlic bread, and deviled eggs.  Everything was so yummyI went with the beef wellington and it was perfectly cooked and juicy.  The potatoes au gratin were delicious and melt in your mouth cheesy.We all passed on dessert and went down to the magic show.It was mind blowing.  Doves were popping out of nowhere (I guess that's the magic part).  Everyone was enjoying themselves and it was a great bonding experience for all of us.The plus was having my classmate Rachel participate in a card trick.Yay for good food and great company.

1210,5/14/2013,"I decided to save this place for my 300th review since it is so special to me and since I've also been here three times now :)This place is amazing. From the moment you see it while driving on Franklin you know it's someplace special and it just continues to amaze the more time you spend there. It's valet only, $8/car. They currently have a backdrop by the entrance that commemorates their 50th anniversay which you can take a picture with. Once you go inside the double doors, you'll check in with the hostess. Make sure you fit the dress code or they won't let you in! They do keep extra ties and suit jackets on hand, but you can't always count on them having some in stock. There is also a gift shop there where you can buy Magic Castle trinkets and games.In order to enter the actual castle, you must say the ""secret"" passcode to the owl in the bookcase. Doing that just adds an air of mystery and exclusiveness to this place ;) All the magic shows are great here and if you're lucky you will be picked to participate in one of them.They have five rooms in which there are magic shows:-- Close-Up Gallery: This room is quite intimate and fits a very limited number of people. It's awesome because you can literally sit right in front of the magician and watch his/her tricks. While the decor in the entire castle is amazing, I feel that this room really highlights their attention to detail because there are embossings of the castle throughout the walls and all these different pictures and caricatures. Magicians I've seen here so far: Paul Greene, Red Tsai, and George Tovar.-- Parlour of Prestidigitation (love that name!): I think this is the second smallest room. Not as intimate of course as the Close-Up Gallery but you still feel like you develop a rapport with the magicians here. Magicians I've seen here so far: Daniel Ketchedjian, Ron Saylor, Woody Pittman, and Tom Ogden.-- Palace of Mystery: Definitely the largest room. I think this is normally where you would get a ticket to if you dined at the Castle. There's an elevated stage here for the magicians to perform and usually there are two performers. Magicians I've seen here so far: Dana Daniels, Justin Willman, and Anson Lee.-- The Peller Theatre: They currently only do shows here on Fridays through Sundays. I think this is the second largest room here. I've only been here once, but it was to see the most magical magic show ever--An Evening with (Helder) Guimarães and (Derek) DelGaudio. It took our group three tries to see them the evening that we came because all the dinner guests got priority over us. But waiting for them was WORTH IT. These two are just so mindblowingly amazing! I saw them again when they did a show with the Geffen Theater and I cannot say enough good things about them.-- W.C. Fields Bar: They are currently doing shows here on Thursdays through Sundays. I haven't been in this room though so I can't say how big it is :/This is not to say that you can only see magic shows/tricks in these specific rooms. All Magic Castle members have this gold pin that they wear, so if you see someone with that pin, you can usually ask him/her if he/she would mind showing you a trick or two. I think it's really nice of them when they do so and you can see some cool stuff that way. There is also a ghost at the Castle named Irma who plays the piano and will take requests. She's pretty good at knowing current songs so that's always a fun thing to do between shows. Of course you can also get your drink on since they have multiple bars here and there's always someone to take your drink order while you're waiting in line for a show (or right before a show begins). For food, I think you can order sides at the bar (at least at the bar downstairs by the Peller Theatre) or you can have dinner here. I've only eaten here once, but it was actually pretty decent despite the negative Yelp reviews I had read beforehand. And it's nice that you're guaranteed seating for at least one show (since they give you a ticket with your meal).I have yet to see NPH here but that is definitely something on my bucket list! My friends and I were lucky enough to catch Justin Willman out in front of the Castle the night that we saw him in the Palace of Mystery so we were able to take a picture with him :) (Pictures are not allowed inside of the Castle) I absolutely love this place and can't wait until my next visit (*cough*NelsonF!*cough*)And I must give Nelson F. the BIGGEST THANK YOU for bringing me here and letting me witness two of the most amazing magicians do what they do best :D",5 star rating
1211,6/3/2013,"Had such a great experience at the brunch (this was my fourth visit to the Magic Castle, but I've never experienced the Kids Allowed brunch before).  First of all, let me get this out of the way.  Yes, it's expensive.  As in very.  expensive.  Not being members (but being a guest of a member) we had to pay a $30 per person cover charge, (kids included), plus $10 valet parking fee, so in a party of four, we paid $70 just to place the car and walk in.  After brunch was over, with tax and tip, that was another $150.  Tips for the ghostly piano player Irma and the bar staff plus additional drinks were a small addition to the total.But the brunch was fantastic.  You will see a lot of complaints about the food here, and I have never had a dinner here (my past visits I just visited and had drinks and appetizers).  Ahi on wontons, prime rib, an omelete bar, salads, fruits, desserts, crab legs, shrimp, were all top quality.  There is even a kids bar with waffles, ice cream, chicken tenders and other kids items.Walking around the castle in the daytime was a real treat, as the signed posters, memorabilia, alibi machine (in the men's restroom), wallpapers, and details everywhere are amazing to see.  Saw three shows, all of which were well done.  All were oriented towards kids, and it was a very nice touch to allow kids to sit in the front row so they could see the magic tricks clearly.  A few points on service that seemed noteable:  The valet guys are the most professional in Hollywood.  They take your name, explain they are going to inspect the car, take care of the car, and return it in a very professional manner.  A strange thing to note, but they really stood out.The food servers seemed rushed and a little confused, and were slow in service.  Requests and notifications that things were missing were taken care of... eventually.  The bartender was a little distracted and was cleaning things for about 5 minutes until he saw me and took our order.The manager who helped with the flow of people in and out of the shows was also very helpful in two additional ways - when we had a small girl that was scared to go through one passageway, she helped us find a different way through the passageways of the Magic Castle to see the show.  When we had a trouble finding another show, she got us to the front row and guided us through the castle's many levels.",5 star rating

1215,10/27/2016,"My husband and I stayed at the Magic Castle Hotel to gain entrance to the Magic Castle. Spoiler alert: after attending the magic shows, we met a number of magicians who said if people just contact them, they have no problem forwarding their info for the guest list. So if you find yourself unwilling to spend the night at the hotel (which was great and very reasonably priced), if you try and find contact info for a magician, they might be able to help you!Otherwise, this is a very unique attraction! One of the highlights of our trip! If you stay at the hotel, they have a van to bring you to and from the castle. They will ask you for a ticket at the front (you don't need one if you made your reservation by staying at the hotel). You check-in in the lobby and gain entrance to the castle through saying ""open sesame"" to an owl in a bookcase. You'll get a schedule of the nights shows and this can be the complicated part. Based on your dinner reservation, you need to create your own itinerary of what shows you want to see and when. I think it's impossible to see all acts in one night, but it's probably meant that way to break up the crowds. There are multiple bars located on two floors. There are also magicians that roam the areas and just start performing magic at a cocktail table - very cool! The magic acts range from ""I know how he did that"" to unbelievable!One tip: you will be told to attend the magic act that follows your dinner, however, this is not the only magic act going on at that time. Id say skip that one and focus on the other acts with shows during that time slot. The after-dinner show is more of a variety show and kind of dull. Also to note - there are magicians and rooms that people highly suggest - do yourself the favor and wait in line for those shows. The room often holds less than 20 people, and there is a bartender that comes around to the line to fill drink requests, so take a seat and wait 10-15 minutes before the show starts. It can be chilly in the castle, so maybe bring a wrap to keep warm. Dress code is enforced. Cell phones are prohibited but I did see people with their phones out so it isn't as highly enforced as other places. The food was very good, especially for a place that doesn't need to have good food. We enjoyed garlic bread, the prime rib and the pork chop. The prices also weren't terribly inflated like they could be.",5 star rating
1216,2/2/2012,"I've been here twice.  The first time I was here for Valentine's Day and we got the prix fixe meal that they offered for that day.  It was just alright from what I remember.  The mahi mahi I got was overcooked and dry.  But then again, you're not really here for the food.  You're here for the amazing ambiance.  The up close and personal magic shows and the opportunity to brag to your friends that you've been to the Magic Castle!  Screw the food, you're special and part of an exclusive club!As I was saying, the decor in this place is great.  Really does resemble an old castle.  It's almost like the Haunted Mansion ride at Disneyland minus the haunted ghost part AND there's alcohol!  There's really nothing more you can ask for.  And once again, you get bragging rights.",4 star rating
1217,8/27/2013,"So I payed $250 for a trial membership. It was my dads birthday and I was planning something special. Why not an exclusive club? I was excited as the date got close to our reservation. When we went, as soon as I walked through the door I payed $50 for the 2 door fees and valet fee. Expensive already and I haven't even sat down yet! when we went for our dinner reservation and ate, the food was ok. Nothing special. No seasoning on the veggies. My mothers chicken was overcooked and tough. desert wasn't good either. & The waitress was not too helpful. Since it was our first time and we had lots of questions, she seemed  annoyed. I think for the price paid it should have been better! This is why I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars. I was thinking 3 but I can't because we mostly went here for the magic! And I thank The Lord I wasn't disappointed by that! we Didn't have time to see all the shows but it was awesome! I cannot forget handsome jack! he hit on my mom;) hahaha!!! and the most delicious food there is the cheese bread! Wish I could of just ordered that but I had to purchase an entree to be there and see the shows. I just wish it wasn't so pricey! but overall, even after the bland meal, the magic overcame it all and we had an awesome time! I loved the close up gallery! Definitely go earlier than your meal time so you can see all the shows!",4 star rating
1218,8/23/2010,"I only managed to get to one show and it was OK, I'm sure some of the other shows are better.  I would recommend coming early so you can see 3 or maybe even 4 shows.  Speaking of dinner, please eat somewhere else before you come, the food here was terrible.  I had the most expensive meal on the menu, Beef Wellington for $38 and it was totally tasteless and bland.  You can get a tendor, flavorful ribeye from Ruth's Chris for $1 more.The atmosphere is very different, I felt like I was in a Harry Potter movie.  They have a strict dress code of jacket and tie for men.  It's actually the strictest I've ever seen, they got mad at me for taking my coat off!  I just laid it on the back of my barstool as I was eating my steak and someone came up to me and told me to please put my jacket back on!  They also don't allow photography inside because they say it bothers the frequent celebrities who come.  As I said before, I only managed to get to one show and was nothing to write home about.  One thing that sucks is they recommend you show up to each show about half an hour to 45 minutes before it starts to get a seat.",3 star rating
1219,10/21/2016,Its a great experience. I rate it a 4.5 stars. Its a beautiful venue and the decir is beautiful. Having to dress up to come here is a nice change. Overall the positive points:The ambiance and decor is beautiful.The shows are pretty good. Some more than others.Just getting to explore is fun enough.Drinks pretty good.Entrance price pretty good.The only negative is:The food is expensive but that was expected. Also the waiter takes tip without consent. We went in a group of 4 couples and each couples bill was like 120 then after we each paid the waiter comes back with our cards and says she already took a percent from each. A mean we were gonna leave tip anyways jeez i thought it was kinda annoying honestly but eh. If i ever have the chance to go again i would but  i could do without the food- it was average tastewise and too expensive. Overall it was a good experience though.,4 star rating
1220,8/23/2010,"This is a cool place to take a date or a group of peeps to, but then again you have to know somebody who is a magician. Luckily through the years I have known somebody to get us in this place. It has always been a pleasure to go in and see all the magic being performed. If you go for dinner I'll have to say the dinner aign't worth it. The food is mediocre so after one time I have opted out of dinner at the castle and gone straight into the good stuff.We had the best performers the night we went so it made it that much more special.

1222,6/14/2015,"The Famous Magic Castle.  The classic combo of dinner and a show.  Now let me tell you my experience from Magic Castle last night.First off if you visit here with dinner, be prepared to spend some $$.  I would say with dinner and drinks your night will run about $200/person.  As soon as you pay your $30/person entry fee and $13 valet parking fee.. say the magic words and the faux bookshelf opens up.  Dinner.  Our group had a bottle of wine, garlic bread appetizers and calamari appetizer.  They were good. calamari was a little cold but it could be from the freezing dining room.  I had the filet special that had Dungeness crab on top and my wife had the prime rib.  Let me make one thing clear.  YOU DO NOT GO HERE TO EAT.  you're here for magic, entertainment, and some LA history.  The food is simply not good.  Prime rib was almost cold and flavorless.  My filet was overlooked well past medium rare as requested and the meat was very grainy.  I did not finish the meat.  My friends beef Wellington was very good however.  total damage? $685 for 8 ppl.Main show was Rudy Coby and he was good.  Very comical routine.  I think the sword swallower was the most entertaining.  Atom did mostly novice tricks that wasn't very impressive.Around the castle it's mostly smaller magic shows.  Mostly card tricks, some coin tricks and a rope magician.  Siegfried was awesome and Sumet was pretty trippy.Once in a lifetime visit.. I don't really see myself going back though...",3 star rating
1223,9/20/2015,"Strict dress code.$13 for parking.$30 Cover per person.In order to get a ticket for the main show you must have dinner. The least expensive dish is the risotto, which is basically just rice, for $31. Plus mandatory 18% gratuity added to your check. Do the math. For two people that drove together you're at least spending about $140. Not including drinks! And you're probably going to have at least a couple of them to enjoy yourself here. I ended up getting the 6oz filet mignon ($39) with water. It was good but didn't fill me up. The main show, about 45 minutes long, was entertaining. Everything else I saw was just card tricks.I'm glad I went so I could see what all the fuss was about. In my opinion it's not worth the money. This is the type of thing I'd go to once but never again.",3 star rating
1224,2/8/2013,"I had the pleasure of attending the magic castle this past weekend and it was truly magical! I had been dreaming about attending the castle for quite some time now. The only thing holding me back was their strict admission policy. The rumors are in fact true people... You either have to be invited by a member or be a member to attend. So after reading sevral blogs I emailed a couple of my top magicians playing at the castle requesting some guest passes. I got a response back from the fabulous Mr. Regal who was beyond generous and sent me a total of 8 guest passes! I was ecstatic!! The magical day came and my friends and I all got spiffy and off we went. Just a FYI the dress code is very strict! Which I personally love. It just adds to the whole experience of being at the castle. I mean no one has ever heard of attending a castle in casual wear, now that would really be a abomination! So make sure to read their dress code on their website before you go. I had the pleasure of saying the magical words to open the doors leading to the castle. Upon arrival you are fooled to think that the castle is rather small, but do not fear! There are SO many twists and turns in that castle it really is BIG! So feel free to explore. Our dinner reservations were at 9:45 so we went early to catch a couple of shows. We saw a ventriloquist who was hilarious! I've never had a doll hit on me but I guess only at the castle that would happen. We also got to squeeze in two more magic shows before dinner. I was utterly amazed with how talanted these magicians are. Finally dinner came along and please do not go in thinking that dinner is horrible due to the reviews below. Dinner is FAR from horrible it was actually AMAZING! I read a review on here where they compared the food to airplane food. Seriously, those are all rumors and just people with weird taste buds to say the least. I am a vegetarian and to my surprise they had vegetarian options. I got the curry pasta with veggies. My boyfriend got the steak which he also fell in love with. Eveyone in our party was actually pleasantly surprised with the food. So please indulge. Just a FYI it is a bit pricey but again it is the magic castle. Now for the last show we saw!! OH MY WORD! I have never seen a man float in the sky! Or change a suite instantly at a blink of an eye! The show was an hour long and really just topped the night off. We all left with smiles on out faces. You must eat dinner to attend this show...or so I think. That is how we got tickets after paying the bill.To sum up my enormous review! Magic Castle is truly AMAZING! If you have the opportunity to attend do not pass it up! You will really have a MAGICAL NIGHT!!!",5 star rating
1225,12/18/2012,"What are all these people talking about.... The only way I would ever go back and be able to enjoy myself is if I was under heavy medication and drunk!Yes, the staff is friendly but this place is most definitely overrated. Our night started out with us showing up to this place and them not letting my boyfriend in because his pea-coat had a zipper on the inside that no one can see. It was a $300 coat and they would not let him in with it. Okay so the guy was polite and whatever and offers to bring him out a coat in his size. Well he ends up bringing him a size 40 coat which he was swimming in. We didn't leave only because we were invited there by my best friend.Then we proceed to the dining area. The whole place looks like you are at Disneyland minus the happiest place on earth crap. The food was mediocre, at best... I've had better pasta at Olive Garden and my boyfriend's steak was overcooked and chewy and it was overpriced, of course, but you already knew that.Then we went into the ""main show room"" and the show was... Geez I can't even find a word to describe the guy. There was no magic, only sarcastic and insulting comments made to the audience members so we walked out to wait for the rest of our party.If you want a good meal and a memorable experience remember this: YOU'RE IN LOS ANGELES. There are a million other places that you can go to that are better. There are celebrities that even refuse to come here. In my opinion this place is a cover up of some sort... lol Seriously!",1 star rating
1226,7/15/2014,"I was invited here as a guest of a member, so luckily I didn't have to pay to get in...so I can't speak to the membership fees or admission cost.Overall I was impressed with this place, it's a very old residence that has been kept up and the staff does well to keep the charm going. The food wasn't as bad as people made it out to be...it's a magic show, not a 5 star restaurant...go into it with that mindset and you'll be okay. Drinks were a little on the expensive side, but they were good.Staff here was great, no attitude or ultra-massive egos like you see everywhere else in Hollywood. Dress code is strict, suits and ties for the men, evening dresses for the ladies. From what I can tell, mandatory valet parking, but it's on the side of a steep hill, so it's actually better that way. The other guests were also pleasant to be around, and it helps that everyone is dressed nice.There's a few different showrooms, some small, one large, and I think 5 or 6 bars. In addition to the showrooms there's magicians in the common areas doing tricks as well. Everything is spread out pretty well on 3 different levels (I think). There's no natural light anywhere and it's like a Las Vegas Casino - it's hard to get your direction or figure out where you are relative to the outdoors. I think that kind of adds to the mystery. There were times when I had no idea where I was or what level I was on (think Haunted Mansion at Disneyland).Most of the magic here is card tricks and what not. There really wasn't any disappearing acts or sawing a woman in half like you see on TV. But we had a good time. We thought we had only been inside for 90 minutes and it turned out we had been there for almost 5 hours already.",4 star rating

1230,11/5/2009,"A magnetically enchanting and spellbinding experience! WOW! what'll I have to tell my grandkids... adopted ones, of course. First off, last night, 11/4/2009, marks the 100th anniversary of Magic Castle and it was an honor to be amongst such a talented array of magicians. Everywhere you turn, you see a magician that is standing/sitting/lying.. ever so aloof around you, only to dazzle you with their incredible tricks and powers that'll turn your head into mush. So what, go ahead, have one more glass of that absolut and you probably can stumble onto the stage floor. Please, just don't fall asleep, that's just rude.When first driving up a steep passage into Magic Castle, you're instantly enthralled by the castle, but terrified by the fact that you might not have changed your brakes recently, and that your car will roll down in an instant's notice. Next, when you're actually in the Magic Castle, you're instantly captured by the photos and all the little refined details on the walls, in the telephone booths, in the bar area.. EVERYWHERE! Ladies, if you do go, please wear walkable heels so you don't end up butchering your feet in your fervent pursuit of shows. Even though the shows were good, for me, the magicians chillin' near the bar were the ones that made the Wednesday evening, one of the most memorable and riveting nights of my life. I want to thank five particular magicians, especially, because they made the initially slow night, into an encapsulatingly fantastic and mesmerizing world that gave me a new direction in life. No, silly, I ain't gonna be a magician, cuz I ain't got the dough, but... it certainly lights up my understanding of the pursuit of happiness.  To tell ya the truth, I'm an exceptionally skeptical person when it comes to magic and reality, but Magic Castle, and their uncanny magicians, are slowly turning me into a true believer of life and miracles. Miracles do happen, just on a more frequent basis in Magic Castle. ;)",5 star rating
1231,2/1/2014,"The Magic Castle was an amazing evening of magic and dinner! It was so different than any other experience I've had at a dinner event. When you arrive at the castle, you drive up a winding driveway and see the castle lit up from the hill. You are not allowed to take any pictures in the castle, and are told this rule before entering. There is a small gift shop and coat check when we first walked in and we were given a schedule of the night's magic events. We went on a Thursday night so it was not that crowded when we arrived a little before 7 pm, but it did get more crowded as the night wore on. We went to our first magic show in the close up room which is small and intimate so you feel as if you are a part of the magic! After that we went to another show in the parlor of prestidigitation which was very entertaining. We had a delicious dinner at 8 pm with excellent service. Entrees were pricey at about $40 a person and that is the only thing that kept me from rating the magic castle five stars. The food was good, but I did not think it was so delicious that it warranted that high of a price. I would suggest the truffle fries and if you don't love garlic make sure to tell the server as the truffle fries have a bunch of garlic on them (a fact that is not mentioned on the menu). If you ever have a chance to go to the magic castle, take it! It's an experience like nothing else!",4 star rating

Thanks, random friend whose father is a Magician Member!I don't have much to say that 800 other people haven't already said, but I did want to mention that, while the menu looks impossible for vegetarians / vegans, they actually do make special vegetarian and vegan meals. As a vegan, when I am in this sort of establishment, I expect to be shoved a plate of steamed veggies and a plain baked potato. However, the night I was there, they made me a plate of Pumpkin and Black Bean Enchiladas, with a Tomatillo Sauce and even topped with Daiya cheese! Are you kidding me?!? It was very good... and, I may add, less expensive than all of the normal, meat entrees... so, if you want to eat as cheap as possible there, you can claim you are vegan. ;-)And THANK YOU for the dress code!!!!

Also, make sure to do your research and check their website before you go. You dress to impress, and get ready to have a night with good drinks, food, and performances. I suggest planning and timing your show visits as you need to show up 20 min ahead for most of them, probably 10 minutes ahead for smaller ones. One of the shows got cancelled due to unknown reason when I showed up, that was kinda sad: / otherwise its a great experience for a group of people, just make sure you don't get lost there:) its also helpful to uber or lyft there",5 star rating

1238,12/5/2012,"I suppose there's a reason why someone is always asking if anyone has the hook ups for the magic castle. It's really pretty fun and very entertaining. Though let's just lay it out, without the exclusivity of having to know someone who knows someone aspect, perhaps this wouldn't feel as special. Then again, that's part of the magic. So you need to know someone who knows someone who has an invitation and what not to get in, but once you appear inside, there's no illusion, this is all sorts of fun. With the alcohol libations and the pretty solid food, your hunger will be cut in half.. Okay, enough of the bad puns. It's not that hard to get in here if you put some effort and when you do, it's really a fairly neat little venture. It's one of the reasons as to what makes Los Angeles neat and any of the magicians performing, and there will be a lot of them, will make good times appear. Be prepared to pay a bit of cash as it can get costly, but there's no tricks here - that's what a whore does for money, Michael.

1239,2/26/2015,"The hype on this place was unbelievable and it truly was an unbelievably horrible experience for many reasons as outlined below. I would take away this star if it wasn't for the amazing magician who did a semi-private show for us at one of the bars.1) I had heard stories about the strict dress code so I put together an outfit that I thought would be in compliance - cocktail dress, heels and leather jacket as it's known to be very drafty inside. The second I got to the door, I was told I couldn't wear my jacket. That was a shocker since I didn't see anything written about jackets. Apparently they don't allow jackets with zippers which makes no sense. Thinking they were anti-zipper, I asked why pants with zippers were allowed. No response. So I was forced to check my jacket and accept an ugly oversized loaner blazer.2) Mandatory $30 cover charge plus they insist you have a dinner complete with entree, no splitting allowed. Food was waaaaay overpriced - entrees were upper $20's - high $30's and food was meh at best. I have no problem paying these prices if I actually enjoy the meal. I had the short rib was a bit tough and the accompanying veggies were one step above raw. 3) FRAUD! The worst of the offenses that was the caveat for this review. 2 days later I checked my bank account and saw multiple charges from the venue. The cover and the dinner charge were legit but there was a mystery $174 charge that was not. My bank advised me to shut down the account and accompanying credit card to avoid more fraud from the venue. This was a complete pain as I had a lot of auto-billing tied to.I emailed the details to the GM to alert him about the fraud. To his credit, he did respond shortly and said he would look into it. 2 days later he responded and told me it was not fraud but it was a standard practice for the restaurant to put holds on credit cards. He also commented they receive several inquiries a month from customers who thought they had experienced fraud there. Outside of hotels and car rentals, I've never experienced a hold on my card FOR FOOD,  I can not make sense of this absurd practice, did they think I was going to trash the restaurant like a hotel room? Also couldn't comprehend why they would hold more than double the amount of my dinner $68. And, more importantly, if this was a recurring problem why don't they either eliminate this practice or at the very least, inform the restaurant patrons?! I responded with the above questions and asked for some kind of credit as a testament to the customer service and did not receive a response or credit. 4) The magic - Saw two shows. First was in one of the smaller theaters and was pretty hokey, a bunch of basic card tricks performed by an overly chatty and non funny magician. Second was the headliner show in the big theater. The emcee was a hilarious and very talented Aussie female magician. Three follow up acts that were pretty sophisticated and intriguing.Takeaway - Caveat Emptor!",1 star rating
1240,11/11/2010,"WHADDUP MAGIC CASTLE!!! Like many, I've been waiting... and waiting... to get invited. Luckily my husband got us guest invites from a member. I think one member can invite 8 people or something. You do not have to get dinner to come here... and depending on what kind of invite you get.. you may or may not have to pay cover (we did not have to pay). Strict dress code. Only stuff that you'd wear to a wedding, seriously! The people in front of us were not allowed in cuz someone was wearing tennis shoes!Magic show in the main room was great! Funny, fast and overall very cool. I'm not talking about card tricks, I mean full on making large objects disappear and reappear. =) If you get dinner .. you're guaranteed seating (150 seats).The other side show we watched was a card show (parlour room)...was not bad but card tricks aren't my thing. You can watch as many shows as you like up until midnight!!  Oh! And they have bar service in the shows, so you can order drinks .. sis got a blue moon for $7.. it tasted really good... Meandering around the castle was fun...like the Invisible Playing Piano and the ""trap door"" (which you have to say ""open sesame"" to enter)  for ladies - bring a sweater!! They really turn up the AC! Dinner was slotted for 6pm... got seated and served promptly. The dishes were actually pretty good! I liked my pan seared salmon (seared to a light crisp on the edge and great risotto). hubby got prime rib medium rare - a little too much on the medium side but nothing terrible. sister got the chicken dish w/ side of spinach - pretty good too. Unlike what other people say, I would NOT recommend the portobello fries.. thought they were overly greasy .. overrated mushroom tempura. Valet parking - $8 ...getting there sucks... so much traffic, I'd advise taking the metro.  But yes... FUN NIGHT!! Great seeing everyone all dressed up! I can see why they keep such a dress code. =)",4 star rating
1241,11/5/2012,"I think the coolest part about the Magic Castle is that it is legitimately a meeting and social spot for local magicians to hang out and show each other their tricks. It's not just some theme park where the magicians clock in and out. So it's really cool to be able to be a part of that community, even if you're not magical!I got to go on a weeknight and thought it was a super fun, unique experience - one every Angeleno should try at some point. I saw a total of five shows, and two of them, both in the smaller room, really blew my mind. One was OK, and the two I saw on the larger stage left me very unimpressed. I guess I like the smaller scale sleight of hand guys better than the over-the-top guys with the girl assistant and the weird dance-like moves and plastic smiles. Not my favorite kind of magic. The place itself is super cool as well ... they encourage you to walk around and explore, and there's lots of interesting stuff on the walls and in every corner. My least favorite part of the night was the meal. First of all, it was REALLY pricey, and besides the cheesy bread I didn't think anything was very tasty. But, I am willing to sacrifice good food for one night of really awesome entertainment. If you get the chance to go, I definitely recommend it!",4 star rating
1242,4/24/2013,"I wish we could give 3.5 stars as I couldn't truly bring myself to give a 4. The grade ""Yay I'm a fan"" means I plan to go back and recommend others to go as well. I'm not sure we'll ever go back and my recommendation will likely be ""Well, you should go once to say you've gone before"". Magic Castle is definitely an experience that you should have once in your life. Whether you choose to go back is going to be personal preference. The magicians and their acts are charming. Some of the introductory illusions are predictable especially sleight of hand and some will blow you away. The lines aren't really long from act to act and there are several bar spots that will happily serve you drinks. We had dinner as a group and the food is so-so. The steak the wifey ordered was partially eaten and packed into a doggy bag; but then we decided to just leave it at the check in and didn't bother to pick it up again (a personal barometer of mine if we thought the food was good enough). You should definitely make sure you see the main act for the day/night as that will be the ""attraction"" for your attendance. Otherwise, it will feel as if you're just at a magic carnival passing from kiosk to kiosk. One of the acts onstage was a card/sleight of hand magician who was unfortunately betrayed by the lighting and seating angles in the audience. It was easy to see the black faced cards he was holding flat until the moment he flashed them, as if to appear from nowhere. If you stay until closing, expect to wait 10+ minutes for the valet to get your car as there is only one driveway to the entrance. So even though they might have several valets working, you are at the mercy of simple physics. Why didn't I feel like giving it 4 or 5 stars? Perhaps the novelty of the attraction was lost on me years ago when I first heard about Magic Castle (90s). When I first heard of it from a friend who was a member then, I should've made time to see it as it definitely sounded cooler at the time. Perhaps I needed to access my inner child a bit further so that I might have walked away more impressed.",3 star rating
1243,4/26/2014,Had such a great magical night here. It is a great place to go to when you want something different with some good friends and you are set. It's very elegant and vintage and has such a mysterious setting to it which I'm sure is the point but I loved that about it. The last big magic show (magic vs science) was great. I'll def go back here. Good place to take a friend for a bday or special occasion.,4 star rating

1245,8/29/2013,"This place is a classic Hollywood experience.  Its by invitation only but members are pretty generous about hooking up a friend of a friend of a friend.The castle is actually a big victorian manor with surprises around every corner.  In addition to the main show there are magicians tucked here and there doing card trick exhibitions.  Exploring here is the fun part.The food is spendy and average.  Whether you are in the Space Needle, The LAX concept restaurant Encounter or here its pretty much the same deal.  You're not here for the food.  The drinks, however, are reasonable and quite strong.",4 star rating
1246,9/29/2006,"Thought about this place a few months ago (during my dark pre-Yelp days), and reminisced about how cool it was to go here, even if it was my one and only time.  Was it expensive?  Absolutely.  The best way to go here is to resign yourself to following the MINO principle (Money Is No Object), and you'll be fine.  Maybe the food wasn't the best in the world, but how many times in your life are you going to be able to eat dinner under a Tiffany stained glass dome, inside a Victorian quasi-mansion?  For me, it was a pretty low number to begin with (okay, technically, the number was zero), and will continue to be a very low number, but at least I can say that I've been, thus bringing my grand total to ""1"". I was literally mesmerized by everything I saw there, from the decor to the memorabilia everywhere I looked.   Although I don't consider myself to be a magic fanatic, I can certainly appreciate the art and the mystery behind it.  As far as the Magic Castle and the concept itself, there's nothing in town that compares.  And THAT my friends, is why I gave this place 5 stars.",5 star rating
1247,6/10/2010,"Magic Castle ahhhh LOVED it!!! Been here twice and both times were excellent..first time went during Christmas Time and it was all nicely decorated with Christmas trees, decorations.  2nd time I came here for my birthday during October and it was all decked out in scary Halloween Decorations.Both times I have been I really enjoyed myself and my guests enjoyed themselves a lot too..There are a few downfalls to this place.NO PICTURES...whaaaat?? Yesss you heard me NOOOO PICTURESSSS..ahhhhh how the heck can you NOT have any pictures here..it was my birthday dangit and your not gonna let me take any pictures of me all dolled up? =( Booo..I totally forgot that you weren't allowed to take any pictures inside which really bummed me out.  Another thing the ENTRANCE fee to this place is prettty freaken expensive I think it's now $25 bucks..jeeeeez..unlesss you know someone? Which I don't. boo. =(The food here is quite good but definitely pricey there were a total of 8 of us and each couple ended up putting in $100..yikesss..but I really enjoyed the garlic green beans, garlic bread and the other appetizers we ordered..the roasted half chicken was delicious..The Piano is a lot of fun too..hanging out and asking it to play for you..sometimes she just doesn't play..forgot the piano's name..but real cute..just to lounge around on the sofa and hang out before the show starts.The card tricks, the parlour, and the magic shows are terrific..I can't wait to go again..If you pay $20 to get your picture taken you get another pass to come back to the Magic Castle..woo hoo..=)  Pros-great shows, great food.  Castle is great very mysterious.

1248,1/19/2014,"I've been here three times now. Twice in the past two months. Magicians rotate, so I've never seen the same show twice. You will have to stand in line for shows though (especially on a busy weekend night.) No taking pictures inside.Strict dress code. $9.00 well drinks. Specialty cocktails range around 12-15. You will have to valet. Some people invited will have to dine (which is delicious but expensive.) If you get in as a guest, and don't have to dine first, then you can get apps at any of the bars (fries, tacos, etc.) To date, my favorite show was one I saw last night. The magician: Rob Zebrecki. It's like Daniel Day Lewis and Jim Caviezel had a magical baby. His show is a hilarious mix of self-deprecation and creepy. Pro-tip: Try to go during the week when it's not very busy.",4 star rating
1249,6/29/2015,"Went here last night with a group of 6 people total to celebrate a belated Fathers Day for my boyfriends dad. If you do not know by now, the Magic Castle is an exclusive, members-only club. To gain admission you must either be a member or know a member. We knew someone and received a pass. However that's not all you have to do to get in. All guests must make a dinner reservation at the restaurant inside the castle to accompany their entry. When I say ""must"" it means mandatory (I've been twice now). To preface this, please note that a trip to the castle will cost a hefty price (entry cover, dinner, drinks, valet = $$$).The MC is located on a beautiful hill overlooking Hollywood. We drove up the driveway and valet the car. Got out to see some velvet ropes which was the line to get in. Waited in line for 10-15min while the bouncer/doorman checked in each group reviewing the rules (Dress code and absolutely NO photos or videos). Once we got in, we are inside a small room where the front desk checks your reservation and asks for the entry fee and any valet fees. That night cover was $30/person and $13 for valet. Pretty unreasonably pricey if you ask me considering we are already eating dinner there (not by choice) and buying drinks. That's one star off from me.We paid and received a helpful pamphlet with show times and info. Then we were prompted to say ""open sesame"" to one of the bookcases and it magically opens. Considering the exclusivity of this place, I will not go into detail about what it's like inside. It truly is a magical place filled with lots of history, ambience, and of course magic and entertainment! There are guides everywhere that are also very helpful. You'll also notice an array of characters mixed in the crowds and even some celebrities, too.I'll finish this with a review of the food. The restaurant is conveniently located inside the castle. The menu consists many options, even for vegetarians. We ordered the calamari for the table and some signature cocktails. Entrees that were selected: beef Wellington, filet mignon with blue crab, soy glazed sea bass, and prime rib. I got the prime rib, Cajun style (upon request). We also ordered two side dishes: Mac and cheese and mushrooms. My dish already came with vegetables and mashed potatoes. My prime rib was a 12oz (larger size available) and cooked medium rare. It was soooo good! Tender, fatty and flavorful. One of the best prime ribs I've had. And the best part was the Cajun seasoning which I don't see as an option at most places (comparable to Mortons Cajun ribeye which is one of my faves). Sides were not that amazing but the entrees made up for it. Survey of the group showed the same satisfaction for their dishes. My advice: entrees were great, don't order the sides unless you're really hungry. For dessert we ordered the chocolate molten cake with a side of vanilla ice cream. Also very good, not too super rich and enough to share after a large meal.Aside from the hefty cost, my experience was well worth the money in the end. I would recommend everyone to experience the Magic Castle at least once--it is a unique and special experience that can be enjoyed with your loved ones.",4 star rating
1250,7/20/2016,"The castle is invite only, we knew a member so we got a reservation. Overall the food was pricy but well worth the price, the magic was even more extraordinary!

1251,12/17/2015,"Finally went to The Magic Castle last night. It was such an experience, and definitely SO fun. First of all, stepping inside the building is like a time warp. Nothing has changed since it opened, and that adds to the allure. I enjoyed the fact that everyone must be dressed up (and they are serious about the dress code!). The staff was all truly delightful. Since it is the holiday season, there were carolers moving about the dinner area. They were great and took requests from tables. Kind of fun.  If you are lucky enough to score an invite, be prepared to drop some cash. I spent about $130 and could surely have dropped more if I stayed out longer. Totally worth it in my opinion. Here are some tips:1. Entrance Fee- $20 (during the week fee, higher on the weekend I think)2. Valet- $13 dollars + tip. I would try and plan your dinner around 8 and get there earlier for drinks. The valet fills up and then they are forced to make you remote park and take a shuttle. That kind of cheapens the experience in my opinion. 3. Dinner- Be prepared to spend around $60-70 just for standard entree and a drink or two. You MUST eat dinner to see the main show. We had an 8:00 seating time for dinner for the 10:00 show. The show lasts about 45 minutes.4. After/before dinner and/or main show, spend time walking around the castle. TONS of hidden acts/things to see. 5. NO PHOTOGRAPHY is allowed in the castle and they are pretty strict about it. There is a gentleman walking around who will take your picture. Costs $20, but you get an invite pass back to the castle if that interests you. A few of the ladies in my group did it. 6. READ THE DRESS CODE. Make sure you dress accordingly. 7. Plan Ahead---you may need to make reservations for your group months in advance for dinner. Make sure you plan in advance. 8. If you are a vegetarian, there are limited options on the menu (I think they had a garden risotto when I went), so just a heads up. Anyways, This experience was totally worth it and I will hopefully be coming back in the near future. Definitely a must-do for Angelenos new and old (as well as ""tourists."") Don't be afraid to make small talk with members and magicians that you bump into. Met some amazing folks and had great conversation. A 10/10 Evening for sure!",5 star rating
1252,5/23/2016,"I am a magic skeptic turned enthusiast. I recently planned a trip to the Magic Castle for my partner's 30th birthday. I was worried that the night would be cheesy or gimmicky, but I have never been so delighted in being proved wrong. The club is classy. The restaurant served us an incredible gnocchi and a top-rate filet mignon. The birthday cake and champagne were unexpected and delightful. The wine selection is good, and the cocktails are generous. The service everywhere was impeccable. But the real highlight of the Castle is, unsurprisingly, the magic. We both experienced childlike joy exploring the hallways and rooms of the Castle, finding talented magicians at every turn. The venues are intimate, and we loved running into magicians around the club that we had seen perform just minutes before. We are already looking forward to our next visit.",5 star rating
1253,11/7/2012,"Okay there's certain things in life that I believe make people instantly think very highly of it.  1) Hype - The service/product probably isn't the best out there w/ regards to being the best out there, but due to hype/marketing/etc. it will be gobbled up by people out there.  2) Cost - Just cause something is expensive, that means that it's gotta be good!  Just like going to a $100 / person sushi restaurant and saying it's delicious just because it's $100 / person.3) Exclusivity - If something is hard to obtain or something is not widely available to the public, these things are thought of as being better.  Just like a status symbol, ""I have this and you don't so it's cool!""I'm sorry to say but the Magic Castle is all three of these and not worth the time or the money.  Maybe it's because I've seen too darn many magic shows and almost all the tricks were easy to figure out.  Maybe it's because we were only there for 5 hours instead of the potential 8.  When asked, ""Didn't you love it?"" I without a doubt could reply, ""No"".Hype - This place has been touted as a great place to see great magic tricks.  I've been told by multiple people that the magic is great, the atmosphere is truly immersive and that I'd enjoy it a ton!  Yelp has it as 4 stars with 800+ reviews which adds to the hype but I just don't buy it!Cost - If you're not a member, you have to do a dinner and MUST order an entree.  I ordered the prime rib.  Why? I figured for $30 / entree it was the only thing that could potentially be worth it vs. the chicken and salads.  The wifey ordered the same and when they came out, hers was noticeably larger.  I'd say about 1/4"" thicker.  Same with everyone else's at the table.  The food also was pretty bad.  The beef was flavorless and the vegetables were half way between raw and cooked.  Stack the $31 + tax + tip on top of a $30 cover charge and that makes for one super expensive night.  Not worth it, I'm sorry.  The biggest thing that annoyed me, is when the waitress asked if we wanted sparkling or flat water.  I assumed flat water meant tap.  Nope, flat water is Evian.  If you go here, ASK FOR TAP!!!!  She opened 4 bottles before we could even say no.Exclusivity - This is probably the main reason anyone thinks this place is great.  The fact that you can't get in unless you're a ""member"" or you're invited by a member gives it a cool factor.  When we were here, there were TONS of people.  We also just emailed one of the magicians and he got us in with passes.  As we were waiting, one of the people in our group saw another massive group of people from Meetup.com.  They also got in with an invite.  So exclusivity is nil if you know who to ask and since it's so packed, it's not any rating adder.Okay so on to the ""magic""  WARNING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY DID TRICKS STOP READINGSince we went during October, they had a halloween/monster theme going on and it was fun/cool for a little while.  During the performance, it was packed in the theater and we were left to sit in the back.  Props to them for cramming people in there so no one was left without a seat.  They opened with a typical ""empty"" box that you could see through, but obviously had a deep bottom so the ""assistant"" could cram herself into there.  Decently executed but still predictable.Then they moved to another trick with an ""empty"" cage to make an ape appear.  An ""empty"" cage that was only half as deep when looking through compared to looking at it from the side. This was just poorly executed. since we could definitely tell the cage was twice the depth.  This ape was then ""tied"" to a couple of spears, one of which was obviously connected to the stage.  When they ""tied"" this ape to the spear, the magician spent about 4x as long on the left spear as the right.  Obviously fastening a harness that the ape was wearing under its ""pajamas""  The ape was then rotated to be 90' from the spear as if floating.  Yay!  It's obvious there's a harness!  Another poorly executed trick. Then they moved to another trick with panels that they would build a box with.  These are literal wood panels that they would construct the box with so there's obviously nothing on the stage that they would sneak on.  Until the magician walks towards to the side holding a panel blocking the view of the lady who ran from off stage to on stage behind this panel.  This was also poorly executed since she was fairly visible when they she came out.  The only truly cool tricks were the mind reading ones.  So again.... I don't' know if it's that I have seen too many magic shows or if these are all just too basic, but for $60.  I'd have expected to be wow'ed.  Not ""M'eh""'ed.  Would I go back?  No.  If it were free?  Maybe, to see different magicians.TL:DR - Overpriced, over hyped, exclusive club that I'd not suggest wasting your money on. Food isn't good and ask for tap water.",2 star rating

1256,6/11/2009,"A truly great experience. I can't tell you too much about this magical place (oooo, ahhhh) but I can tell you some of the things that I thought were special.If anyone has seen any specials on the Magic Castle it's just as cool if not COOLER than those. Not only is this a safe house for magicians but it's also  a restaurant with (from what I hear) outstanding cuisine, and if you eat here you get a ticket to the big show. And if you can get in as a guest I was told that the more alcohol you consume throughout the night, the better the magic got! And they way they help you with that is they have over 6 bars in the castle, fully stocked and all wonderfully decorated. If only there weren't so many secrets....They have 4 performance spaces and various other smaller ""show"" areas all of which are different and unique. They range from seating 5 to 75 with not a bad seat in the house. I was able to get a tour from a member of all of the subtle nuances of the castle, like architecture, stories, and secret areas. This was one of the best nights ever, the magicians were all great, huge headliners in the magic world, we had the opening for us Daryl, whose close up magic made me drop my jaw, there was Scandanavian Champion magician perform some very amazing slight of hand tricks that was narrated by a ""how to do magic"" soundtrack (Kristian Nivala). There was a magician who used doves and fire and special effects (Dan Birch) with a double bill with hilarious trickster Mark Kornhauser. I was also tickled silly with Derek Hughes as our closer.

1260,2/10/2013,"I came to Magic Castle with my boyfriend and four of my friends.  My favorite thing about this place was the bread at dinner.   Invitation:  I really wanted to come here but I didn't know anyone who is a member.  So, I sorted through the Yelp reviews and found someone who said they were a member of the club.  Then I message the person to see if they could invite me.  He obliged and sent me an invitation.  The invitation is good for a couple months for a maximum of eight people.  You are required to make reservations and go to dinner.  Honestly, I'm not sure how they know if you go to dinner or not.  I guess thats why they make you give a credit card number when you register...maybe they charge a fine if you don't do dinner?  Getting to the Magic Castle:  The castle is located in the heart of Hollywood, so expect traffic.  We pulled right up to valet and they took our car.  To our dismay, we then had to wait 20 minutes in a line outside so we could get inside.  This is a line to pay the entrance fee, by the way.  The Castle:  This place is cozy and filled with lots of rooms that you can wander through.  It's alright, nothing to write home about.The Magic Show: I was really disappointed with the magic shows.  I think I had my expectations too high.  It was good, but nothing mind-bending.  One of the shows went on way too long.  The tricks he did were cool until he tried to stretch each one out for several minutes.  Its like, man, I get it, move on.  Also, they really need to let you sign up for shows before you arrive.  Otherwise, you kinda just wander and TRY to make it into a show.  Maybe I would have enjoyed the shows more if I were drunk.  The Food:  This was sooooo disappointing for the amount of money you pay.  My boyfriend got a steak.  Yes, it was huge, but 50% of it was pure fat.  The bread was the best part here!Overall, I'm glad I came here.  Everyone should come here at least once.  But, I won't be back.",3 star rating
1261,4/27/2017,"One of the places that I always wanted to go turned out to one of the places I will never go and spend a penny or recommend to anyone. People need to remove this from their bucket list.  On a school night my wife and I, took 3 couples (friends out of country visiting Los Angeles) to ""The Magic Castle""  Sure enough it was Magic how they took our money and left us ashamed front of our friends from out of town.  We made a reservation for dinner, spent $900 on top of ~$200 entry fee and parking for 2 cars.  I am not complaining about the amount, but what I expect when I spend that kind of money is to have fun and enjoy the food and the drinks.  Food was typical food, nothing fancy, the drinks were not good at all.  Mixed drinks hardly had alcohol and the ""Guinness"" Beer was like a water, no taste to it.  The waiter was nice enough to change it to another beer, but charged at the end.  I did not complain, I didn't want to look embarrassed front of my guests and did not want to have any negativity to the night. Instead, I tipped extra on top of 18% on the bill . The main show which required a ticket was good, we enjoyed & laughed (John Armstrong, 5 Thumbs up. Great Show). After the main show, we had time to do one more show so we went downstairs for the closeup show.  It was 8 of us, 5 of us stayed in line and the other 3 went to the bar ad restroom since we had 45 minutes before the show.  An Asian employee came to me and asked how many people in my group, and I said 8.  5 in line and 3 are on their way.  he said that they can not stay in line when they come back, they have to stay at the end of the line.  While he is telling me this, 2 people from the group front of us left for drinks, came back with drinks and didn't have to go stay at the end.  While I am talking to this guy, the 3 people of my group came and he didn't let them come and stay with our group I was OK with it, I didn't want to make a big deal, so I said ok.  So, then when I said OK, this dude came to me and said 1 of you wont be able to go in because it is full.  I am telling you, this guy was doing anything to get other people in(maybe friends of his, or he took tip from them, I am not sure).  So I asked him politely, that it is 8 of us and I cant have 1 person stay out.  He said let me check with the magician and see if he is ok.  He didn't even go anywhere, went back to the end of the line talked to another person in my party and told him that the magician is not OK.  Reading the reviews on Yelp, I can tell yo that all shows accepted people more then the capacity if they agreed to stand.  Anyway, I started complaining and asked for his manager.  An African American lady came and said that she is the general manager.  She wouldn't even ask us what happened, she went checked with her employee and came back and said that we can go in.  She never listened to us, we have 5 witnesses of what happened, but she had no time to listen.  I woke at an entertainment industry, and I will be honest with you, you will not find a single manager in the company I work for having as bad attitude as this lady.  She needs customer service 101.  We are the costumer, she should have at least listened to us.  I even said that I spend a lot of money at dinner, at the main show (for drinks). She said it is not about that.  Of-course it is about that, it was obvious.  When  we exited, she didn't even apologize.  the African American men (very nice guy) who was at the front door when we entered, came outside and apologized to us.  Because he saw when we walked in how well we listened to him and his directions. Everything he told us, not taking pictures, etc. We listened and obeyed.  Anyway, I don't care how good your food or magic is, the best thing this place needs is great costumer service, specially from the Manager on duty.  This place does not care if you go back or not since they are well known and there is always a lot of people going.  But people like me who had guests from out of country, tried to impress them with Magic, were impressed by the magic of the employee and the manager.  How they magically took a lot of money from me and did not provide the service that was needed.  Great job Asian dude and Manager.  you guys were the best magicians.  Will never go back to this place and will always talk negative about this place, so people will know this is not a bucket list item.

1263,5/30/2014,"My friend invited my friends and I to attend the Magic Castle last night. I had a good time, but it was definitely very ""LA"" lol. The people, the somewhat overpriced food, the atmosphere...Entertainment: Most of the magicians were great and I like how you can go to different parts of the ""castle"" and see all types of shows. Just remember to stand in line early for certain ones because they can fill up quickly and you'll have to wait for the next one. Also it sucks to have to stand in the back of the room if you're wearing high heels for the night, and they don't take kindly to you sitting on the steps/floor. Food/ Drank: The drinks weren't too bad on pricing (averaging $12, typical LA pricing) but the food was okaaaaayyy. Maybe because I got an entree salad for $30 that consisted of two huge wedges of iceberg lettuce, bacon bits, alright chicken and some dressing. I should have opted to spend $6 more and gotten a real meal, but I was somewhat strapped for cash. But you have to get an entree salad or entree to receive tickets to the main magic show for the night. You must dress ""classy"" or they won't let you in! Also don't take any photos.

I was with a group of 7 people and I think I can honestly say we all had a spectacular time! With the place done up for Halloween, it made it all the more amazing. I'm going to have to give their dinner a 3 star rating, though. When you're forced to pay at least $30 for a meal that's really quite mediocre. Oh well. On with the show! My favorite shows were the main Palace and the Prestidigitation. Also, Michael Battle's performance in the ""bowels of the Castle"" was really entertaining! Where he got those giant flags from - who knows! And he was kind enough to give us a tour of the castle after the show, explaining where how when in one part the dining room, we we were standing ""in the air"", how the main theater was originally the garage, and how one of the walls is made up of doors from an old abandoned hotel. Michael is so personable and you can't help but feel that you're in the presence of a really interesting person. And what was really fun was we were technically there on Halloween, since we didn't leave until 1. It was also really fun - since costumes were optional, a lot of the guests were dressed up. We didn't know that optional really meant ""you really should wear your costume if you wanna look cool""! *sigh* We loved dressing up and it was still a great experience. An amazing night!

1268,3/28/2017,"Went there for a friends' bday with a group of 8.  Hadn't been there since I was a kid and apparently, they don't even let kids in there anymore now.  Where to begin?Valet is $13 and the only parking option.  Our entire group was not present, so they did not let us in until everyone was there together.  We were all dressed up, but they still had issues with our attire.  One guy in our group had no jacket on, so they made him put on one of theirs.  Another guy had on a jacket, they deemed not fancy enough, so they made him put on one of theirs.  One girl also had on a jacket they didn't like for some reason, so they made her take it off and check it in.  Another girl had on a dress they deemed too revealing, so they made her cover up with one of their skirts.  We all had to pay a $20 cover per person.  This was all before we had even walked inside the actual ""castle.""Once we got inside, we had dinner reservations at 6pm.  The service was consistently poor throughout our time dining there, and the tables and chairs were so crammed together that there was no space to move at all and barely enough space to eat.  Our waiter was not competent and he and the other ""servers"" and bus boys that waited on us made so many basic errors when it comes to serving that it was embarrassing.  They did not remove the huge wine glasses all over the table immediately after finding out only two of us were drinking wine.  I asked our waiter what beers they had and he listed two, paused, and said he wasn't a beer person and didn't know any others they had.  How do you not know what beers are offered at the restaurant you work at?  They forgot to bring one drink, and then when we pointed that out to our waiter, he counted 8 of us and the 6 drinks on the table (one girl was pregnant and not drinking,) he stubbornly said yeah those are all the drinks I wrote down, so you got what you ordered (even though he took down 7 drink orders.)  They waited forever to fill our water glasses and only filled them half way.  We had to ask them multiple times to please come and refill our waters.  One of my friends ordered a lobster, then changed it to a steak and the waiter said ok.  When the food was delivered, they brought both the steak and lobster and charged him for both.  When one of my friends and I tried to order just a salad and some appetizers and sides, the waiter informed us that each person must order an entree or would be charged $50 per person (all the entrees were between $35-50 anyway.)  I ordered a vegetable soup which was not that great, and came in a huge ""bowl"" that was so shallow, it was really disguised as a super deep plate (maybe about a half inch deep literally,) so there was barely any soup.  My entree I was forced to order was the risotto which was not great and definitely not worth $35, but since I'm a vegetarian, that was my only option.  The most I've ever paid for vegetarian risotto is like $20 and this was almost double that.  My friend's gf brought a birthday cake with her so we could all share it together, and they have a cake cutting fee of $10 per slice!  We ended up paying $80 for about half of the cake that they cut for us (8 slices, $10 per slice.)  By this time, it's about 7:30pm and the show we are going to see starts at 8pm.  We ask for our bill, and it takes forever for our waiter to bring it.  He finally does and gratuity is automatically included for parties of our size, which sucks because there's no way I would've given any tip with service that horrible, but just my and my friend's combined bill for two of us was over $130 with the generous mandatory included tip of over $20.  More than $130 for crappy service and blah food.  After we give the waiter our credit cards and are waiting for him to bring them back, other tables are closing out their bills after us and leaving to go to the show.  We were waiting forever again.  Finally he comes over and apologizes and says he somehow mixed up our bill with another table's bill or something and he would have to go back and fix it.  By the time he actually brought us our correct bills and we all paid and got our cards back, it was almost 8pm, so we got seated in the very back corner of the room where the show was going on.In the show room, the chairs were very small and uncomfortable, there wasn't enough room, you couldn't see the stage because it was not elevated enough to see from the floor and chairs where we were sitting, and that magic show itself was not that impressive, as it was just a bunch of pre-made trick boxes and contraptions and stuff.  So we got the worst seats for the show because our waiter messed up our bill and took forever to close us out.After the show, we saw some up close hand and card type of magic and that was very good.  I took my jacket off for a few minutes, and 1 of the security guards immediately ordered me to put it back on & informed me I must wear my jacket at all times, aside from the dining area or during a show.",1 star rating
1269,11/25/2012,"First off, you have to be 'invited' by a member - Which, let's face it, is pretty cool. Also, there's a dress code - also pretty cool. Finally, the 'no photography allowed' rule completes the trifecta of pretty cool and adds to the shroud of mystery that surrounds the castle.If you eat dinner here (and you often have too), expect to pay a grip. In fact, they magically empty your wallet! But the food is good and it's part of the experience, so suck it up.The Magic Castle is home to the best magicians in the World!The magic is everywhere!

1271,11/7/2012,"I NEED to brag about my awesome time at the Magic Castle!Okay, so if you don't know, the Magic Castle is a private club. Very exclusive. So you must be invited to go or be a member. Thankfully, my boyfriend knows someone in PR who knows someone and I got invited on a whim. Score!This is definitely a special occasion place. It's not a cheap evening. I paid a $20 entrance fee and was told that we had to have dinner too. Entrees start at $24. And of course, you're gonna want to drink. All in all, I think I paid about 70 bucks for food and wine plus the entrance fee. And I bought a souvenir photo ($20) which gets you another guest pass so you can visit again! Now I can plan my own little outing here. Yay!We were also guaranteed admission to the big stage show, which was nice. It was the best show hands down. Joel Ward I believe was my favorite act. Lots of disappearing doves and ladies. It brings you back to the times when going out and getting dressed up were half the fun of seeing live entertainment. And I like that.The food wasn't spectacular, but it was good. Think wedding food. I had an 8oz filet mignon for $32. Good, not great. A little dry but thankfully there was meat juice on the side.But everything else makes up for the food. I just love the old school feel of this place. And the shows are spectacular. Also, I got to meet the president of the Magic Castle, Mr. Niel Patrick Harris! I was so impressed that he was there and chatting it up with the attendees. I'm definitely a fan. Needless to say this night was Legen....wait for it....dary!!!!",5 star rating

1273,3/27/2013,"The Magic Castle is a Los Angeles Institution. If you have the ability to visit, take advantage of it. The shows are very entertaining (if not perfect, some of the ""Magic"" wasn't so magical and you could see what was going on). Whether the magicians are in the show rooms or at the side tables located throughout the venue, they're still pretty impressive. It has been over ten years since my last visit and from memory, I wasn't expecting to be thrilled about the dinner, but was pleasantly surprised that the food was good. One of my friends' pasta tasted ""tinny"", but the prime rib was great, as was the mac n cheese and truffle fries.It is NOT a cheap evening with entry, dinner and drinks (you get one salon show with dinner, the others you have to queue up and wait to get stand-by seating for), so make sure, regardless of what time your dinner reservations are, that you arrive in time to see more than one show and wander around and see the card tricks and other magicians on the other areas. The place has a very old school, kitschy feel to it, so despite the expense and dress code, don't expect modern decor. But I think the 60's vibe added to the atmosphere. I'm looking forward to going back soon.",4 star rating
1274,6/18/2011,"Unique place. I am glad to been invited by friends. The building is rich with history, and you definitely get a sense of it from the different generations of magicians that entertain there. From what I understand the brunches that allow children to attend is new -- our daughter loved it. From requesting songs from Irma the ghost at the piano bar to the breakfast buffet to the shows with lots of audience participation. Everyone who worked there was nice and friendly -- which honestly surprising to me. I've seen lots of magicians in Vegas and other cities and I've always thought of sleight of hand magicians, while talented, as mean-spirited and enjoy embarrassing people. The magicians here, not even close. They joke and kid for the show, but their love for what they do is unmistakable and comes through in each performance. It's clear they want you to see why they love magic.",5 star rating

Make sure to move around and check out all the close-up shows as those were our favorites. Valet is $10.Protip: if you want a photo, make sure to ask someone at the end of the night to take one of you in the lobby (it's too crowded to do it earlier).",5 star rating

It was a weekend evening and I received an invitation from a client, so I brought a friend who was dying to come along.Yes, it is a castle, and a lot of heart was put into the actual building by it's members. There is a lot of neat history here and we were welcomed and given a tour (even drinks) by one of the Castle board members. Such hospitality. The restaurant is traditional and on the expensive side, but it's about coming here for the experience so you won't mind it. There are magic show throughout the evening, both close up and stage.

1278,4/17/2015,"This place is amazing! I went here last night with a member. It was actually our first date (how cool to go to the magic castle on a first date?) There is a dress code that forces you to get fancy. Now on a first date, if someone takes you to the classiest place in Hollywood, it doesn't get much better than that. We arrived around 7 and ha dinner reservations for 8. They have a valet service and take good care of your car. We had a great time! saw 5 magicians, got tickets to the main show which was hilarious and magical at the same time. The dinner was delicious! I had the jumbo shrimp while my date had the salmon. We were both pleased with our choices and it left us full for the entire night. Be sure to visit a couple bars in there because they often have a magician and an amazing bartender. We also made a couple of friends with other people attending the castle on a Thursday night. I can't describe this place well because it is just amazing! going on a Thursday night was a great idea because although there were quite a few people there, I'm sure they get packed on Friday and Saturday nights. Long story short, if you ever get the chance to go, go to the Magic Castle and you will not regret it. Remember ladies, dress to the nines in a fancy cocktail or formal dress, but make sure you are comfortable too. And guys, make sure you are wearing your jackets with your suit, even through the entire castle inside. Classy classy place.",5 star rating

Food is pricy but pretty great - and they can definately make a good Lemon Drop martini.  Note that you don't have to get dinner - you can spend a minimum of $15 on appetizers and stuff and get by without burning too huge a hole in your wallet - then buy more drinks! The main show was kind of silly.  I wasn't impressed.  The smaller shows are more fun, but you have to get there early and get a good spot up front or actually at a table where the magician is working.  All the tricks seemed to involve cards though - where's the hat and rabbit tricks? lolBrought in a lot of people, spent a lot, and got a free pass to come back though!  And I will.  But, I'll get there early & watch some shows BEFORE dinner and before it gets too crowded.

1282,8/2/2012,"I've decided to put my 1000th review on a place I've been to many times and I could actually sketch my review... yes. I told some of the yelpers I'd quickly sketch my experience... so giving it a shot here.sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/h…FOOD:I've had food from here and it's not good... and it's overpriced. So if you are going to eat here... don't. Go someplace else first. The brunch isn't bad. Dinner... eh.SHOWS:I have not been disappointed in the shows I've seen here. They've made me laugh, they made me cry from laughing, they made me have migraines... yes... migraines... because IT BLOWS YOUR MIND. I am thinking SO hard... that my brain hurts. It's pleading with me to STOP THINKING and LET IT BE. But as a overthinker... I can't help it.Favorites: * One magician I saw... on my birthday. I forgot his name but he is generations of magicians... he had BUNNIES as part of his show. WTF. BUNNIES! Real, moving, cute, cuddly BUNNIES. I was acting like I was having an orgasm that time. BUNNIES. I f**king LOVE bunnies. That made the show great and my reaction to the bunnies made everyone KNOW I love bunnies. The tricks were great and it included bunnies. SO HAPPY that moment.* Another was  Guimarães and DelGaudio - two Magic Castle winners. They did a duo performance that was MIND BLOWING. I was impressed. They did stuff that seriously... movie magic. They need to work for Hollywood. It's no wonder they are winners. Even Neil Patrick Harris praised it... F**cking Barney Stinson / Doogie Houser praised them! That's a BIG deal. So seriously... awesome.* Another guy is a favorite of mine - he always wears a cowboy hat and he sings country songs he made up himself. He's SO funny. He's a comedian AND magician. Seriously... great show.IRMA THE PIANO: The ghost who plays the piano... she knows Gaga... but I dunno if she knows any other current song. Can someone request ""Call Me Maybe"" and let me know if she plays it?DRESS CODE:Very strict. They do have sports coats for you if you forgot it - MEN.Ladies... dress pants or dresses/skirtsMen: Look like a Boss, not a gangsterAMBIANCE:Very historic feel... kinda like the Golden Era of Hollywood - 1940s-60s. Then you go outside of the Magic Castle to the ghetto... helllooo... :P But the inside is beautiful.

1286,11/12/2012,"After all these years and hype, I was finally invited to the Magic Castle! It definitely lives up to its exclusive, mysterious image. Once you turn into the driveway, your roll up the hill to the Magic Castle and drop off your car with the valet.  You're then greeted into the lobby where you check in with the host and pay for your dinner/admission. Then she tells you to say ""Open sesame"" to this little figurine on the wall. It's kind of cheesy but fun at the same time. Suddenly the door slides open and you're transformed into this dark mansion bar and a number of other folks that are dressed up to enjoy the festivities. The decor of the mansion is fun and whimsical. No matter where you look, you'll find some sort of stereotypical items you'd think of when you think of a haunted house or something. For example, there was a portrait hanging from the wall with someones eye balls popping out as if they were following you. Open up your imagination and you'd have fun with it. My friends and I decided to enjoy a glass of wine at the bar while we wait to be seated for dinner. The prices are average but note that their alcohol section is relatively limited.After being seated for dinner, we're greeted with warm bread. It would have made my day if they had apple or maple butter. If someone is reading this, please put this in their suggestion box! For dinner, I got the Pan Seared Salmon with Tomato Confit and Dried cherry Saffron Rice ($29). It was well made, especially the tomato confit. The flavor was condensed and well packed with flavor. Others in my table got the Macadamia Crusted Sea Bass with the Yam Puree and Mango Salsa ( $31). It tasted better than my Salmon and even had a heartier portion size. I may have to pass on dinner in the future. While it was good, I felt like it was overpriced for what it came out to be.After dinner, we tried to catch one of the shows. However, it turns out you need to be there at least 30 minutes before one of the free shows to get a seat. Since seating is limited, you basically have to wait in line to ensure you get a spot. If you don't no worries. They have a number of shows throughout the night. However, just be prepared to wait for the next one. Our main show was fun. We had a surfer magician so he was extremely laid back. It turns out one of his assistants is his step-daughter. Lol. While some parts were relatively cheesy, it was fun to actually see it all live, especially in the intimate setting. It may be more fun to get a little trashed so you end up more amazed. I'd come back again if the invite was extended. I'll have to make sure I drink plenty of coffee since the shows go late into the night. Note: No cameras allowed.",4 star rating
1287,2/20/2013,"I love the Magic Castle.Why is it so great? You get to see magic shows by some of the top magicians in their field. They Magic Castle is constantly bringing in new shows so you often get to see something brand new. You have to dress up. To some, dressing up is a pain. To me, it's bliss. I like getting hussied up to go out. I like having a reason to wear pretty dresses and do my makeup. I like getting dressed up with my friends and going somewhere uber exclusive. It makes the evening all the more special.Drinks. Cocktails. Wine. Champagne. Bartenders that can make you whatever you like. Need I go on?The decor. It's a beautiful hotel. It's got a lot of interesting, older items used by past magicians. They've even got a corner dedicated to the Haunted Mansion ride from Disney. You could spend the evening exploring the castle and do nothing else and be perfectly content.Themed nights. Occasionally these happen and it's fun to do Christmas in July or some other silly thing.The piano that plays whatever song you want. From show tunes to Lady Gaga, you can listen in the parlor room all night long.Food at the bar. Actually amazingly delicious. Sometimes food at the bar is sub par, or satisfies you barely.

1292,9/3/2011,"The only way to gain access to the Magic Castle is through a member or by staying at the Magic Castle Hotel. We did the latter. We are huge magic fans so this was a must do. There might have been a secret wish involving a magician turning my husband into Brad Pitt, but I digress.Back to our visit. You arrive, pay your cover and go through the ubber secret hiding space. From there you go to dinner which was unremarkable.Although the menu descriptions were very appetizing, the final product was just blah.  It wasn't awful just not comparable to the prices that you pay. Service was just okay.After dinner is when the fun starts! All the shows & magicians were FANTASTIC. I absolutely loved the close up magic. I also appreciated the small intimate performances. Drink are pricey but good & not watered down.For the most part, our L.A. trips are usually pit stops on our way to Maui. For these trips we only need to pack bathing suits, flip flops & sundresses.  However, if we want to visit the Magic Castle we need to pack a dress & heels for me and a suit, tie & dress shoes for my husband. Although we LOVED the Magic Castle and all the shows, this may be the only time we get to visit. Baggage fees are mainly to blame. Definitely go! At least once.",4 star rating

There's all kinds of magic in this place starting from the front door.  You walk in and pass several bar and seating areas that have magicians. The tricks are amusing and a great crowd pleaser. The general decor and architecture make for an interesting stroll around the castle and for people watching. Its a really fun way to spend an evening, whether in crowds or finding a secluded seating area for two. One thing i will say... Come here with at least a (few) bills in your pocket because you will be dropping them on drinks and dinner (1 entree per person minimum...)

1297,2/11/2013,"Ladies, time to put on your Manolo Blahnik's! Guys, find your best James Bond suit! I have been wanting to come here for the longest time, but you need to get an invite if you're a regular peasant like I am. Fortunately, one of my girl friends asked me to join her and a friend to Magic Castle this past Saturday when they were in the midst of celebrating the castle's 50th Anniversary. I swear it seems so much older. Photos are not allowed past the initial coat room checkpoint and when you first walk in, you're greeted with a bar. My friend Calvin T. could not have been more pleased with that! It was like a bit of a maze in there and I was the only one in our group of 4 to be a first-timer, so everyone wanted to take me around and show me EVERYTHING. Tricks at the bar, to the wonderful piano music ranging from classical to contemporary pieces, winding staircases to intimate rooms with magicians and magic-loving guests alike... there was such a variety of people in the audience that all had one thing in common-- they were here to delight in the visual displays that the magicians presented to you eagerly and skillfully. Dinner... my friends had said not to expect much from it. It's just dinner and it's mandatory to eat there. I asked if my friend wanted to split an entree and he said that they charge a $15 splitting fee. Anyway, it already said on the menu that each person must have one entree. I had the filet of beef, and let's just say... I know why kids don't like brussel sprouts (especially when boiled) because I grew up eating Chinese vegetables and still do. Filet of beef was alright. Mac and cheese was pretty good, but definitely pales in comparison to other places. I actually liked the mashed potatoes, since they were flavored well and smooth. Bread tasted like they added a bit of cinnamon in it, and we all liked the butter. We also all shared a bottle of cabarnet sauvignon, which was nice and smooth, and truffle fries. You can't go wrong with truffle fries.After the last showing at midnight, there are magicians hanging out at the lobby, who are more than pleased to do meet-and-greets and show you a couple tricks up their sleeves (hah) till around 2 AM. I'll be back again at some point. I loved being wow'ed and completely speechless as I tried to think of how the tricks were done and just how simply amazing a sleight of hand could be, or having fun joking with the magician and my friends. A feast for the eyes and mind and you're left chatting non-stop on your way home with your friend. Simply love this place (for the shows, not the food). At the end of the night, we also got a magician's business card before he left with a sly crooked smile and disappeared somewhere in the castle...",4 star rating

1299,6/19/2017,"The staff are all great. Super nice people and they're the reason for the stars. But the castle did not meet expectations. For a $250 dinner for two, you're given two tickets to the main show. This is a problem for a few reasons. The food wasn't the best. When you pay for a $50 entree, you expect it to be good. It wasn't. The cocktails are great. The food is TGIF or Applebees good. Then we were seated in uncomfortable chairs near the back and missed some magic. The magic we did see was great, but not the best. Later on, after a very rude interaction with a member (I get it... we're just guests), we decided it was time to leave. Won't be going back.",3 star rating
1300,12/14/2014,"I was super excited to go to my husbands holiday party at this venue.  I had read about its exclusivity and secret rooms and passages so I was intrigued.  Cocktail hour and dinner was fun.  The food was just alright, nothing really amazing or unique.  The magic shows were subpar and comprised of magicians whose tricks were sometimes revealed by sloppy magic tricks.  I enjoyed the private impromptu magic tricks better than the actual shows in the theaters.  The mind reader was mind blowing & the magician that made more coins appear in your hand was amazing!!!! I think 1 hour of magic is more than enough.  How many card tricks can you possibly want to see? I was bored after the 2nd hour,  the long shows were buzz kills.  Oh and there is no picture taking which is horrible.  How am I supposed to chronicle my evening on FB or Yelp?  My respectful honest opinion, a bunch of rich old dudes that lure people in with their exclusivity and force them to watch old tired magic tricks! Survived the night by drinking at their 1 of 5 bars.  #oldnerdsideaoffun",3 star rating

A very close friend of mine had been emailing tons of magicians regarding passes to this place and she finally received some and my boyfriend and I had the pleasure of being invited.  It was couples night haha total of 6 of us. Very strict dress code; ladies must be wearing a cocktail dress or matching jacket & slacks, Men: slacks, jacket & dress shoes NO EXCEPTIONS.Upon entering Valet was $8 per person entrance was $25Once we were in we grabbed some drinks at the bar ($25 for two drinks)&& began exploring. It was crazy dope inside! very magically and totally looked like a castle, with secret passages and rooms. Magicians were everywhere ( see a gold pin?) there's one!!!We stumbled upon a few magic shows and a ventriloquist show!! All were amazing but of course some WAY better than others. My favorite magicians were the in the MAIN show at the end of the night in the big room!!! Luckily all of our friends and I received a free pass to that specific show after having a DELICIOUS dinner!! Meaning No wait in line unlike most people who were in a very LONG line. I ordered the stuff ravioli with lobster it was TO DIE FOR so so yummy and my boyfriend order a steak it was so juicy and tender!!! I really enjoyed dinner; dim lights, music, candles, it was super cute!!Visiting the Magic Castle really blew my expectations!!

But be warned, they do not carry Ginger beer so if you want something with that in it, order something else unless you like Gingerale. The food was good, I had the lamb with the risotto and it was delicious. They brought out a little ice cream for my birthday which was sweet of them. Not sure who told them it was my birthday but it's all good.The magicians were something else too. We saw 3 acts and they were all so different but very entertaining. Some cute magicians too. Hahaha.

1306,10/21/2012,"First let me specify that my rating here is only for the food. I absolutely LOVE the Magic Castle itself and think it is one of the most incredible places in the world. Apart from the magic the bars dotted around the castle all have their own ambiance and the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive.I have been to the castle about six times so have a good sample size to analyze the food which I have to say has been disappointing all six times. I have ordered all the main entrees from the fish to the chicken to the steak, and the pasta. None of them have been very well made and I always feel like my food was rushed since it never seems to have much flavor and is rarely cooked just right.They used to have absolutely amazing deviled eggs which would have brought my review up to three stars but they took those off the menu leaving only average appetizers. I think it really comes down to freshness of ingredients, nothing ever tastes fresh. The stuffed peppers are good, but the peppers taste like they are months old. I made the mistake of ordering the lobster tail last time I was there and can tell you (as I love lobster and have had it many times) that this was one of the oldest lobster tails I've ever been served.The one dish that you absolutely must avoid is the Penne Pasta with Chicken. This is one of the worst dishes I have ever had at a restaurant and I would have turned it back if it wasn't for the fact that you need to eat relatively quickly in order to make it to your assigned magic show.The Magic Castle is an absolutely wonderful and enchanting place and by far my favorite place in all of Hollywood. Come for the magic and the ambiance, not the food, as this has left me disappointed six out of six times.",2 star rating
1307,9/24/2017,Restaurant is awful.  Worst prime rib I ever had in my life.  Requested medium rare.  They  brought well done.  Too late to do anything about it since the main show was starting in 30 minutes.  25 minutes for waiter to come and take your order. See waiter only every 20 minutes thereafter. Food also came out cold.  This was Saturday night. I don't want to come back here because of the awful restaurant experience.  Restaurant purchase is required unfortunately for the castle.   The magicians were on the other really great.  Brian gillis is my favorite.,3 star rating

1309,9/12/2011,"This place is a magic lover's paradise and after hearing about this place not too long ago and accidentally stumbling(not literally) upon someone that happens to be a practicing magician at the Magic Castle, I finally got my invitation to this intriguing establishment.  So needless to say, it didn't take me long before I rounded a group of friends, got dressed up and stormed the place.When you first get to the Castle, you are carded at the front door then you check in with the hostess prior to entering the Castle.  To enter the Castle, you have to speak a secret password to the wooden owl nearby which will prompt the bookcase to open, very cool.Let's start with the food:Appetizer:Sweet Corn Ravioli - My friends loved this dish but I thought the vanilla flavor came over too strong.Beef Carpaccio - Good slices of beef that paired really well with the Lemon Aioli, I almost ordered another one just for myself.3 Cheese Garlic Bread - GOOD GOD THIS WAS GOOD!!!! No skimping on the cheese or garlic butter underneath the cheese.  Very gooey on top, soft and fluffy in the middle and a bit chewy on the bottom.Portobello Fries - LOVED this, thick slices of portobello mushrooms with a tempura batter that came out crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.Crispy Calamari - well seasoned and crispy, nothing extraordinaryDante's Deviled Egg - Deviled Egg with a bit of caviar on top, but not high quality caviar since I can barely taste it, ok dishMain EntreeBeef Wellington - Tender juicy beef cooked to medium rare perfection with a light flaky pastry cover.  The only complaint was the spinach paste that was used instead of a meat pate under the pastry cover.  The dish came with a Potato Gratin that melted in your mouthHer Seared Rack of Lamb - The lamb was tender but still a little over cooked for my taste when I ordered it medium rare.  It was still tender and juicy but I prefer my meat still trying to run off my plate.  The parmesan risotto however was a bit disappointing.  Lacks flavor and textureSide Dishes Truffle Scented Fries - Barely tasted the truffles, not worth orderingTower of Onion Rings - Too greasyLobster Mac n Cheese - Barely any lobster and not cheesy enoughSide dishes were the biggest disappointment of the nightDessertTiramisu - a bit dry for me but a plus for the strong rum flavor that was still lingering after each bite.Double Decadent Dark Chocolate Cake - If you love chocolate, this is the cake to get, very moist, very chocolatey but not overly sweet.The magic show was absolutely wonderful, my friend even got picked as a volunteer and got to go on stage to be part of the act.  As great as the stage shows were though, you definitely need to get in on the acts that happen by one of the many bar areas.  Those are the best one if you can sit up close to the magician because you will have a better chance at being a participant.  The one I enjoyed the most was where the magician gave my friend one foam bunny to hold and by the time she opened her hand, 5 popped out.I will definitely come here again with friends.  If anything else, everyone should experience the Magic Castle at least once just to see what it has to offer.",4 star rating

1313,5/28/2013,"I've been wanting to come here since forever and a day ago. It finally happened for me and we were placed on the guest list. Upon entering, it was dark and very old traditional european decor. i loved it already.. it was Japan week and the magicians came from Japan. We went to the upclose gallery which I thought was a little ""meh."" It was ""stadium seating"" room and the magician has a table where he does card tricks up close and personal. The magician was okay, not something i would go again to see. We then headed downstairs into the bar area where another magician was performing. It was so bad! He barely spoke english, he fumbled on a lot of his tricks and right when we're waiting for the ""magic"" to happen, he would say, THANK YOU SO MUCH! And then we're all clapping in confusion, looking at each other, wondering where the magic was?! But this particular magician was soo ridiculous it was funny. He messed up so much, his magic barely finished but to his credit, he was a pure comedian.. to our group anyway. We went back upstairs and saw a trio of performers and they were super good.. amazing even.All in all, i had so much fun! Some were a miss, some were amazing, but really how could you not like dressing up and watching magic? My favorite part was Irma the pianist, who is an ""invisible woman"" who plays the piano at any request. She played flo rida-low, and carly rae jepson songs. Haha, I'm still wondering how thats even possible.. but I'm going to have to google irma. Thanks magic castle for an amazing night of festivities.. i loved the experience.",5 star rating
1314,8/14/2013,"Short Verson:  I had a wonderful time here on my birthday (surprise gift from my boyfriend x-D).  I would go again some time in the future if another opportunity presented itself. Long Verson:One of the main things that lures you to the Magic Castle is its mystery, so I am not going to go into grand detail of what I saw, experienced, and whatnot.  You will just have to experience it for yourself! :)  But I will say that the inside directly matches the beauty of the outside.  It makes you feel like you went back in time when Hollywood still retained its own mystery.  Perhaps the Magic Castle is one of the last remaining treasures of such a time. Anyhoo, this place has wonderful shows, some requiring a room for the audience, some just right at a table inside the bar where you are played piano by a . . . well . . . perhaps you should find out for yourself.   The magicians are very entertaining, and the last one we saw right before midnight was by far my favorite.  His name is Danny Ray.  I could figure out the tricks of the other magicians (for the most part), but HIM . . . he had me totally stumped!  (Danny Ray, if you somehow read this, I was the girl at the front whose name you kept forgetting - Jennifer - that selected the torn 5 of Hearts at the end)Pros:  Magical, beautiful, elegant, amazing bar (i dont like to drink, so THAT says a lot!), entertaining, mysterious, fun. Cons:  Expensive, but hey!  You get what you paid for!  And i think, if you bring the right crowd, you can easily say you had every penny well spent.  FYI:  This is 21+ facility, so sorry, no kids or teens.  They will just have to wait like the rest of us :).  Should I become a member?:  Depends on you.  Go once as a guest, and make your decision from there.   Personally, I dont need to see magic shows (though they are entertaining) on a weekly/monthly basis.  The membership is much like a Disneyland pass.  Expensive, but worth it if you go often enough.  So, once again, depends on you.",5 star rating

It all adds up to quite the expensive evening of magic and like Cinderella the magic only last till midnight. Regardless an entertaining evening is to be had where you yourself can become part of the show. The magicians like to use the term ""mind blowing"" and that's exactly what they would like to do to you. They make you laugh as well.

First of all, this is a ""member's only"" club, or by invite only if you know members. They say that, but once you're there, you can easily get more member guest passes. There is a $20 cover charge on top of mandatory dinner. Dinner was alright, nothing to write home about. Expect to spend at least $100 per person for the cover and dinner/drinks. After dinner, you get a ticket to watch one of their main performances. After that, there are magicians doing their tricks all around the castle. Maybe my expectations were way too high going into this place, but the main magic show --though entertaining-- was very amateur to say the least.

The ghost playing piano player was fun.  I can see that someone who is more jaded or a sceptic may not be that impressed with the magic.  You won't see anything out of this world but most of the tricks are good.Overall, a great and memorable evening that we will not forget soon.",4 star rating

1322,4/13/2010,"So all this before the magic even started. By now, everyone was having a good buzz from the alcohol and the bill came out to about $600+, but whatever, haha... THe waiter gave use our main show tickets after our meal.THE MAGICThe food was great and even that was a great experience, especially with a large group of people, but it was time to enjoy what we really came for. We grabbed a few more drinks and stopped by a 79 year old magician doing closeup tricks along the way. After a few cool card and string tricks, we continued to walk to the floor where our main show was at. The vibe was great and everyone was happy to be there. I didn't experience any of the drunken stories read on other yelp reviews. We watched another magician do a rope trick and then decided to line up for our main attracion so that we'd be able to gaurantee our seats.THe Main ShowThe room was small, with 3 rows of seats, stadium style. In front were red curtains and there were several accent lights lighting up the front of the stage. There were two performances. One was a mind reading trick where he guessed who had the odd colored candy in their hand, which was one of our friends so we know it wasnt some kind of set up trick. THe other cool trick he did was the spoon bending trick. That one was amazing!!! The next guy did a trick where he got a signed playing card into a listerine bottle. We know this wasn't set up by a fake member of the audience again because it was our friend again. There were a few other mind boggling tricks but those were my favorites.THe Close-up RoomWe waited about an hour to watch this 20 minute show and I am glad we did because I would have to say it was the best show of the night. While in line, one of the cocktail ladies came by and I asked her if she would be able to get us some fries. The fries were amazingly good! It was finally time to enter the room and it was again an extremely intimate room with three rows of 7 people. The magacian was from Spain and had a funny accent and personality. He performed the most amazing slight of hand routine I have ever seen. From making cards disappear to making them reappear, every part of his act was fun.This show concluded our night and we took one last group photograph in the main lobby before we left.

My dinner was delicious, but my girlfriend got the lamb which, she informed me later, came out barely warm and was pretty rare. In hindsight she probably should have sent it back but I guess she didn't want to make a fuss in front of our company.

1327,7/13/2014,"Sooooo at the risk of having rotten tomatoes thrown at me by all the evident fans of this place here goes my review.  It is not often that I allow myself to be taken somewhere without knowing the first thing about it, (that's right, I am the fun-est, most spontaneous person ever!)  But I was invited to the Magic Castle on a date a while back and I figured I ought to hide the less desirable aspects of my personality for the sake of potential romance, go with the flow for once in my life and see what happens.  By the end of the night I really wish that I hadn't!  This is not a place to which I would voluntarily return.  Overall, it's an expensive outing, there is much waiting and long lines to get inside the showrooms, and the food is not outstanding for the price you pay.  Perhaps it's just not for me.  I don't enjoy dressing up unless I am off to a truly grand occasion and I was told the dress code here is strictly formal, so of course I put on an elaborate outfit that would not look out of place at a 500-guest Middle Eastern wedding, which made for a very uncomfortable evening.   This was especially the case during the various climbs up and down those narrow, dark and dingy staircases.  I think this was the aspect that I found most disappointing.  The interior of this place is nothing like what you might expect a castle to look like.  Or perhaps it is, who knows, but I basically hated everything about it!  Maybe, given all the hoopla about how exclusive the place is and how you have to dress to the nines and all that jazz, I was imagining an uber-glamorous mansion of some sort, but instead there were these tiny teeny rooms everywhere with very questionable decor, light-less, lifeless stairways that you had to blindly negotiate in high heels, and just this odd feeling that you are aimlessly wandering around some eccentric elderly collector's disjointed and claustrophobic home, rather than a place of luxury.  I actually love history but I just found the whole thing old and creepy - and not in a good way!  Granted, in some ways it is an experience unlike any other; some of the up-close and personal magic is beyond amazing.  The skill level required to suddenly pull live chickens out of your shirt while standing a foot away from the audience, for example, is mind-blowing!  On the other hand, some of the more traditional tricks involving cups and balls and such, for example, were not executed well enough so at times the slights of hand were clearly visible.    I guess I just had absolutely no idea what to expect and ultimately ended up feeling puzzled and confused by the entire evening; throughout the various routines and the constant walking and waiting to get to the next performer, there were moments where I was awed, then I was bored, then I felt ridiculously overdressed, and finally I felt annoyed that the reality of the place wasn't really living up to its name.Ultimately I just couldn't figure out what the big deal was.  The Magic Castle is a museum, a performance center and wannabe upscale restaurant all rolled into one, a little overrated and a little pretentious and I just didn't get it, sorry.",2 star rating
1328,2/14/2013,"This place is pretty legit. It's definitely an experience and I firmly believe every Angeleno should visit at least once. I've been here twice- once for a friends birthday and once for a bachelorette. Both times, I felt our groups were too large to really be on the same page about what we wanted to do and what shows to see. The lines are incredibly long on a weekend (both times were Saturday's) so we only got to see one show. The one show I did see was a main attraction, so it was pretty cool. The magicians that are randomly walking about, particularly at the bar downstairs were very approachable. Some negatives of this place is that it's very crowded, food isn't amazing and is quite expensive (drinks too). It's also got kind of a stuffy, ""exclusive vibe"", which is annoying as everyone and their moms knows someone who can get them in. There goes the neighborhood. I think I would like to try this place with just one or two other people and perhaps on a week night when it isn't so crowded. That's the only way this place is worth it.",3 star rating
1329,6/19/2014,"If you can score an invite, it's exclusivity, dapper dress code, and magic (of course) are worth going to more than once. If you have the chance why not go? It's like getting invited to the Red Carpet. Crazzyyy. Bonus points if it's a first date. =p Here are some TIPS when you finally connect with that Magic Castle member or magician performing the week of:If you get invited by a member or magician, there's two ways they can get your max party of 8 in. One is by guest list (each member or magician has a limited amount) where you only pay $30 door fee per person and a mandatory valet of $13. Cheap for the win. The other is by guest pass. You pay all of the above but are required to have dinner reservations at set times (ex: 7p , 9p) and each person must buy an entree ($30+). Based on reviews the entrees don't seem tasty or worth the money. The only pro about going by guest pass is that it gives you a ticket to see ONE of the two big room shows.If you are on guest list, you will not get this ticket, but worry not, you can still see the big shows if there are available room left. All you have to do is, depending on the day, stand in the nonticket line 30m-1h before the show starts. I say stand, because there aren't many seats available. LADIES, flats are your gift from God. Depending on luck, you might get in. I've been to the Magic Castle twice now. The first time was horrible, no matter which of the two big show lines I stood in, it always filled up. I only got to see 1 small show and 1 impromptu side show. The second time I got smarter. Right when we got in, we planned out what shows we wanted to see and what times we needed to stand in those lines. SCORE. We saw 9 shows, even the two big ones. To me the Magic Castle is like Disneyland but with magicians and a dress code; completely worth your time to stand in line. Note: We stayed there for close to 4 hours and our bellies needed more than just liquor, so we ended up getting bar food. Cheap ($10), filling, and good. I liked their Garlic Parmesan Fries.What's great about the Castle is that there are new performers all the time, so you can go back and always be awed. What's not so great is the people. Drunk, loud, and obnoxious. I remember it as clear as day. It was the first time we went, our first small show, the three in the row in front of us kept blabbering away, the magician didn't say a word and continued on with the show, and lo and behold one of the three threw up all over the chair and aisle. Don't eat anything off the floor people. I can only imagine.",5 star rating
1330,7/31/2012,"Last minute decisions!Seriously though. I did not expect to go to the Magic Castle until I was proposed the idea by my friend who got free tickets the day of. Props to Nelson, a magician there, who hooked it up! Probably one of THE MOST random, spontaneous days of my summer thus far (which included other random things as well). If you didn't know, getting free tickets to the Magic Castle is hard to come by. The Magic Castle is an exclusive club. Meaning, you just can't walk in. You have to be invited. This place is so exclusive and particular that you have to even dress up. (Guys have to wear jacket, tie, and dress shoes). Luckily I went to a bridal shower that day and dressed up decent (sheer top with shorts and heels). BUT you can't wear shorts, even nice/slack-like shorts! I felt super sad for my friend who brought me here since I thought I would get turned away. BUT lo and behold, Magic Castle loans skirts! Super random and so unexpected. I couldn't even grasp at how random and spontaneous my friend's and my day was progressively getting. And yes, the skirt actually went with my outfit (long black skirt with a slit). Mind you, that slit was torn (by someone else who wore it) to make the slit even higher. I didn't notice until my friend told me how much of my leg was showing. Also, this Magic Castle has some fine people in here. Haven't seen THAT many good looking guys in one building at once in a long while ;)Other than that, Magic Castle is located on a steep hill in the LA/Hollywood hills. No pictures can be taken inside, but I did get a picture of the outside: yelp.com/user_local_phot… . The inside is a maze of many rooms for dining and shows, some larger than others. There are several bars around to purchase drinks. For me, the castle reminded me of Disney's Haunted Mansion, minus the ghosts. What was very tricky was the bathroom in the lobby. I went in to change into the skirt, but when I exited I was in a totally different room. I went back into the bathroom to find the door where I first entered but could not find it for the life of me. SUPER WEIRD and SPOOKY. Fortunately I found my friend and I kept telling him how tripped out I was. Now to the magic. There are several magic shows to go to, all of which occur multiple times. People who actually paid for dinner get first dibs on the shows and the rest of us who didn't, have to wait  to see if a show room has enough space for us. My friend and I were lucky to get into every show we went to. Each or most rooms are like an auditorium of seats and a stage. In some rooms, people can stand if all of the seats are taken. The first show I watched was a collaboration of three people in the largest room, Palace of Mystery. Lindsay Benner was pretty funny and had balls coming out of her mouth, literally. What I liked most of the show was a song (one of my favorites) that played during her performance by Yann Tiersen. The other magician who we saw in that show was Jon Armstrong. He had all the card tricks. The last person to perform had crazy tricks, Dan Birch. He turned a dove into a poodle, had birds turn into flames and back into birds, and was just ridiculous. He was my fave of the night. The second show was in the the WC Fields Bar.  This wasn't in an auditorium but a billiards room. Chef Anton didn't technically do magic persay, but had several pool table tricks. The last show I watched had two performers. Phil Van Tee had ridiculous tricks with ropes. And PopHayden had ball tricks. Making balls move to and from different cups. He was also cool in my book since he's from the same city I use to live in in Tennessee (Clarksville).

Thank you Roddy!During your visit, go exploring! There are multiple levels and surprise talent and bars around every corner.You're dressed up.  You're visiting a Victorian mansion.  You're being entertained for 6-7 hours.  You're celebrating.  Expect to pay for it.  It is not a cheap evening.  It is TOTALLY worth it!",5 star rating
1335,9/4/2012,"A great spot to visit, because it's a Hollywood Landmark and everyone hypes it up a bunch. But... definitely a, ""That was cool, but I'll probably never go again,"" kinda place.The venue itself definitely gives off a very ""magical"" feel, and it's really fun getting lost in the building.My friends and I loved the improv sessions with the amateur/retired magicians, as well as with some of the not-so-flashy magicians. When it came to some of the Vegas-type magic shows, however, we were quite disappointed.The food is way overpriced compared to the actual quality. We were not impressed, and felt somewhat cheated. My friend found bones in her short-rib pasta, and our waiter told her, ""Well, since there's meat in there - that happens sometimes."" UHHH, it shouldn't happen when the meal costs 30 bucks!! I'd say come check it out to check it off your ""Things to do in LA"" list, and then you can decide for yourself if you'd come back. If you ask me, there are many more interesting things to do in LA!",3 star rating
1336,8/21/2013,"Going to the Magic Castle is a fun experience, definitely something you should do at least once. My friends and I went when I went back home. She contacted a few magicians and was able to get a guest pass. The dress code is pretty strict, so make sure to check their website before you go (basically, dress sharp!).The place is actually pretty big. There are three main rooms where they do the scheduled shows. NOTE: the later the night gets, the more crowded it gets, so plan accordingly on the shows. You might have to get in line more than 30 min before if you want to get a seat. However, there are a lot of rooms to explore if you do miss a show. There are magicians around every corner doing smaller shows, so don't fret if you miss one. Just make sure that you give yourself enough time to line up for the next one. All of the magicians were pretty crazy (although, for some reason, they threw in one non-magician act there, which I didn't care for haha), and their tricks really stumped me, especially ones where my friends and I were sitting right in front watching!The food is not bad, but not memorable either. Like all of the other reviews, you don't go here for the food. However, the food does play into you being broke by the end of the night haha. The food is overpriced for the quality. That, on top of the cover fee (varies depending on the night you go), the valet ($10) and whatever drinks you purchase, will pretty much make your wallet cry. They should announce when you enter that they're going to perform an astounding trick - that by the end of the night, they will make your money disappear **ba-dum tssss** lol.",4 star rating
1337,8/31/2012,"I was really freaked out to go to the Magic Castle for a few reasons. 1. Dress Code. I really don't like wearing high heels and dressing up much. I'll do it if I have to. 2. I really didn't want to overpay for not-so-good dinner. I get heart palpatations if I see a shitty appetizer for 30 bucks. 3. I was worried about crowds and how things worked once inside the building. Let's just say I'd rather stay home than fight everyone on a Saturday at the mall. I'll say that the dress code is not nearly as terrifying as people said on here in some reviews. I was wearing a $40 jersey black cute dress with sandals and fit in perfectly. I saw a lady with a target shirt on and black stretch jeans! The place is smaller inside than I anticipated (aren't most things? lol). You go thru a cute little area once you cough up your entrance fee $. Then you can spend more $ buying drinks when you wait for spending more $ on dinner. You do it just for the experience but I guess I didn't feel relaxed and like I was getting a full experience for the time and money spent on this trip overall. The dinner was OK, not bad, not great. I was expecting that from the reviews I read though. The magic show felt a little bit cheap. We were sitting in fold out poker table chairs and the first act was so-so. I've seen better magic on x-factor auditions. The host was funny tho. The final act was good and I was happy and impressed. I know the magicians travel a lot so you never know who you're going to get. I really didnt feel like i could hang around and drink and wait for more shows. There wasn't a big waiting area, there was a HUGE line for the bathroom that was nearby so I was trying not to focus on my need to use it, and there were not a lot of places to hang out and talk. We basically just stared at each other and said, ok, I guess let's leave. It's also a bit of a maze and you have to walk back thru dinner area (and the next service was eating so that was a bit weird). I'd say try it once, but it's not a place I'm dying to go back to.",3 star rating
1338,4/27/2013,"Wow!  I went last Saturday and had such an amazing time.  My favorite was the man that used to be Frank Sinatra's entertainer.  I'm crazy obsessed about the oldies and I got teary eyed jealous wishing I could have been there back then as he was telling us stories about the rat pack and lucille ball.. I learned a new drink too.. Jack and water.. It's not so bad when you're buzzed. ;)Anyhow, the castle is gorgeous.  You valet your car on this steep hill and wobble out of the car in your heels and walk on the carpet into the reception area.  Check in and then walk over to the bookshelf and look for the owl... Open Sesame! Door opens.. and it's like woah.. Everything is wood and plush red.. There is a beautiful staircase and lots of bars throughout the castles.. Everywhere you go, there's posters and fun things to look at on the wall..  You have to see it for yourself.  It just feels magnificent in there. Walked around and drank.. watched a few shows.. drank.. drank.. shows...  then it was dinner time; we went to the dining area and got seated.. I expected the worse by everyone's review on the food and ordered the safest dish on the menu (pasta with chicken, which i regret).  The food and price is comparable to Cheesecake Factory.  I tried my cousin's lobster ravioli and truffle fries.. they were good.. **if you come here ordering steak and expect it to taste like mastros at $35, you're an idiot.**After dinner, we went to the main show room and watched a show.. The host was the host of cupcake wars.. cute act. then we watched a magician from China.  After the show, there was another show available, so we went to watch that in the parlour room.. then found another show as we were heading out.. :)Spent a total of  $150 for 5 hours of fun.. My money was well spent and everyone had an awesome time.  Can't wait to go back again!",5 star rating
1339,8/1/2012,"Did you guys know that Barney Stinson (aka Neil Patrick Harris) from How I Met Your Mother is the President of this place?! OMG, as a huge fan of the show this was a wonderful surprise when I saw his picture in their brochure. Totally something Barney WOULD do.I just heard about Magic Castle, and when I did I knew I wanted to go. Question was... how? It's an exclusive magician's club and you need to know someone who is a member to be invited. Welp, the saying is true... when there's a will there's a way! Thanks to a little help from a Yelp friend, I got my invite. Magic Castle was on my Sunday night itinerary and I invited a few friends to join me. Our dinner reservations were at 8PM, but we arrived around 7PM to walk around and maybe catch a show or two. When we walked through the front door, we were greeted by the hostess and paid a $20 cover charge. The front lobby is very cool since there are secret doors hidden in the bookshelves. The hostess explained that I needed to say the magical words ""Open Sesame"" for the door to open and Wah-lah, it did! The castle is decorated like it would've been at the time of the turn of the 20th century. The whole experience sort of reminded of being at Club 33 at Disneyland since it had the same vibe of exclusivity and decor from past decades. My friends and I explored the castle and waited in line for a show. Sadly for us, there were way too many people and we weren't able to get in since the rooms only fit so many people. We ended up finding Irma, the resident ghost, who plays the piano. Irma is so intriguing... she responds to your requests with lightning speed and can play almost anything. Unfortunately she didn't like our requests for Kanye and Jay-Z since she didn't know any of their songs. It's crazy because she also knows when you're tipping her and she makes a tweeting bird type of sound. We made our way up to dinner and were seated about 10 minutes ahead of our reservation time. I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli ($31) and my boyfriend had the Macadamia Crusted Seabass ($32). Surprisingly, my ravioli was pretty good. I was expecting the worst since most people here say the food here isn't very good. The seabass seemed to lack flavor when I tried a bite of it. The whole table got a different entree, but I didn't try anything other than the ones I mentioned.After dinner, we received tickets to the main magic show and while we were waiting we found a magician in a fez hat to do some card tricks for us. Apparently, magicians are everywhere and if you ask them to perform for you, they probably will. The key: look for the oddly dressed people... there's a good chance they're a magician! When the main show started, the guy who opened was freakin' hilarious! All of the magicians were really good, but Derek Hughes stole the show. I wish his parts were longer because I would've paid to watch him crack jokes and do tricks all night. I wish I came on a less busier night because we only got to catch one show since it was getting late and I had a long drive ahead of me. I see why people say to come on Monday or Tuesday night instead because the shows get filled up fast. Guys must wear a coat and tie and you can't take it off unless you're at dinner. They're very strict about this. The drinks are pretty pricey and aren't very well made. All in all, Magic Castle is a cool experience since it's pretty unique for an evening out. The castle itself isn't as big as I hoped it would be, but I guess it was big at the time it was built. Make sure to bring some cash for Irma and for the valet!",4 star rating
1340,3/25/2013,"Ever watched The Prestige? This place was very similar to the theme of that movie - great movie by the way! Disclaimer: Guys wear a tie, coat/suit (no zippers!), dress shirt, slacks and dress shoes (business casual) and Girls wear a nice dress and heels - they are very strict in dress code and are not hesitant to kick anyone out who doesn't fulfill the dress attire! Go to their website for more info about the dress attire!I arrived with my party at around 7 pm and we had the opportunity to watch one magic show before having dinner. We watched Joel Bauer and he was alright - he spent most of the time talking about how great he was and how everyone needs him. He did a weird magic trick that involved a person on stage being able to be feel what he was doing through another person - I know, I was very confused myself too. Dinner time: My girlfriend ordered a lobster and shrimp ravioli and I ordered a 18 ounce prime rib medium rare. The portions were pretty big and it got us full pretty quickly. The prime rib was a little too rare and the meat wasn't that tender as compared to other restaurants. Most importantly, what through us off was that the prime rib was tasteless.  For prime ribs at the price of $39 I would still stick to The House of Prime Ribs in San Francisco. The ravioli was better than we've expected and it was slightly cheaper than the prime rib. The sauce wasn't too creamy and the ravioli skin was not dry at all. My gf enjoyed it but she said that they were skimpy on the shrimp.   They give you 8 pieces of ravioli and some shrimp to top it off. The dinner came out to around $94 dollars (18% tip gratuity included since we were also in a group of 9 people). Note: by eating dinner at the magic castle they give you tickets where you can just go straight into the magic shows without having to wait in line and also you have first priority to choose where to sit. You don't have to eat dinner to watch the shows - you just get seated last and you may have to stand if there are no seats.We then watched two more magic shows after that. We felt that the main show at 10 pm was the best and was entertaining. However, the next show after the main show was a little redundant. The magicians did magic tricks that were very similar to what the magicians did in the main show. Overall, I had a great time and definitely coming back. I may save 8 dollars and avoid valet parking though.tl;dr: Dress code strictly enforced, food is just okay and magic shows are great but sometimes redundant. Thus, 4/5 overall.",4 star rating

1347,6/17/2009,"The Castle:Victorian/Old Hollywood ambiance.  Furnishing and decor a bit dated but fits well with the theme.  Loved the method with which you get into the castle - very clever.  The performance rooms were simple, classic, and gives you a feeling that you're warped into another time and space.The food:Sauces were good, but everything is overcooked.  On the bright side, you don't have to worry about food poisoning and undercooked fod.  On the other hand, try to order something you don't mind being overcooked as much... such as salmon. The lobster risotto was mushy with great flavor, the souffle was mushy with great sauces, the porkchop was tough as brick although well seasoned with an amazing sauce.Magic:Definitely the draw of this place.  Some of the shows were better than others, but there were definitely two that left us in awe.  Really enjoyed how there are non-performing magicians walking around doing a few tricks here and there, really adds to the charm of this castleDress code:Come in your tux and gowns!  I'm usually mildly over-dressed for events, but ended up fitting right in for the castle. Service/valet:Friendly service, great people!Price:Food prices are a bit high given the quality, but I think it helps pay for the shows.  Given the upkeep this place must require, I think the prices are farely reasonable for the evening experience.Overall:Great company, amazing experience, loved it and would definitely come back!",5 star rating

1356,3/29/2013,"I LOVE THE MAGIC CASTLE. When I type in caps, it's because I want to make it clear that I am shouting.I was really lucky to be invited here by a friend/magician (friendgician??), and came on a Thursday night. According to my friend, it wasn't super crowded, but it sure seemed busy! Dress code is real: Guys, don't forget your tie, and girls, look good! It is a veritable fashion show in there, and everybody puts in a lot of effort to look fabulous. We weren't doing dinner, so we didn't get an automatic pass to one of the main shows. However, we did fine while getting in line for the various acts. There are three main stages, and we were really lucky to see multiple shows on two of them. I loved the fact that they showcase various types of magic, and that there are magicians literally just wandering around the castle! At one point, the SO and I were standing near a line, wondering if we'd make it into the show, when suddenly a man sitting on a couch asked if we wanted to see some magic. YES, PLZ. We had our own private show right then and there! Also, the SO and I were volunteers for multiple shows (magicians love audience members, and they love the crazy enthusiastic ones) since the audience is fairly compact. I like that the smaller setting feels very intimate, and you and the magician can see each other quite clearly. I don't want to give anything away, but this place is a fantastic place to visit if you get the opportunity. If you can stop wasting time trying to figure out how each act is performed, you'll be happily confounded. The staff are super friendly, and if you're lucky, you might meet Neil Patrick Harris! Valet is $8!",5 star rating
1357,9/16/2012,"Come here for the complete experience.  Drink, dine, enjoy a show, and mingle with the magicians.As previous yelpers have mentioned, you have to be invited.  We were lucky enough to receive VIP invites (no cover).  With a party of 16 - after drinks and appetizers ... our  bill came out to about $60/person.  Kinda pricey.  That's not including all the countless drinks we had at the random bars throughout the castle. Take my advice on the food though.. get the prime rib! I got the sea bass and totally regretted not getting the prime rib after I had a taste.  Also, stay away from the lobster ravioli.. dry and bland!I watched an elderly magician who was strictly doing card tricks at a table.  Loved his old vegas stories of dean martin and jazz singers from his days.  He even showed us how to pull off a few tricks.  There are multiple show rooms and I was able to watch another full show after my time with the card magician.Personally I thought the crowd was a bit snooty.  But who cares if you're with a good group?  You make the fun.  Definitely would recommend.",5 star rating
1358,12/11/2010,"The Magic Castle in Hollywood is the only one in the world, it is an exclusive venue so not just anyone could actually go here.i was very privilege to have celebrated my birthday here with my friends last night. Our group was close to 40 people so there were 5 of us that did the reservations. December is a very tight month. So as early as October, all saturdays were fully booked! Yes that's how busy they could really get. But at least me and my friends were able to get reservations for the last night's event last October.The customer service over the phone were so nice, they pretty much explained to us the policies and their requirements. Booking process was pretty straightforward and quick.It was also great that my guest can come to the venue anytime they want the moment the castle is open. There are no photography and video of any kind allowed inside the castle but you can freely take a few outside or at the reception area.Who can come to the Castle?if you happened to know a magician member from the castle, you can simply ask him to give you invitation card if you would like to have dinner in the castle. one invitation card is good for 8 people. If you don't want to do the dinner but just like to chill and see the shows, your magician friend could add you to his guest list for you to get in.You can also come to the castle if you want to be a magician yourself and become a student. being a student entitles you to get a few guest in the castle too when you go there.Parking:Valet ParkingDinner:I really love the food that me and my friends from my table ordered. From the portobello fries and calamari, to the main dish i had which was roasted half chicken, my stomach was really happy and so are my taste buds. Then we finished up with mouth watering banana cream pie for dessert... really yummy!Drinks:Bartenders are very nice and friendly. This is a really great venue to get drunk.Performances:Every week they have different performers. You'll definitely be entertained and always end up questioning yourself how they did it? or was it even possible? The performers are fun, have great sense of humor and delivers their magic without flaws.i definitely recommend this place when you get a chance to get invitations.",5 star rating
1359,7/9/2012,"Finallllllllly. Check this off the list. Got a pass from a local Magician and headed up to Hollywood to see what this exclusive castle was all about. My date almost got turned away at the door, we had to get special manager approval. (He was wearing a tan suit with tan canvas shoes, apparently they prefer dark shoes and a white sole is not allowed at all). We had a guest invitation which means we have to pay $25 at the door and then purchase dinner. The castle itself is decorated to feel old, walls covered in paintings of magicians past and newspaper clippings, lots of dark wood and stained glass are throughout. The décor coupled with everyone being dressed in fancy black/white attire makes you feel like you step into a world a few decades ago. This aspect makes for a fun and different evening. The food was less than impressive and way overpriced, which is to be expected. I paid $27 for penne with shrimp and a tomato cream sauce. Drinks are pricy as well, Kettle/Sodas are $12 and draft beers are $7. I would've skipped dinner but unfortunately we had get it with our passes.The magic was a bit disappointing, I mean don't get me wrong, it was entertaining and comical, but at times it just felt a bit dated. I was expecting to see newer acts outside of the doves and rings tricks. They space out the show times decently so it's fairly easy to be able to catch most of them if you plan accordingly. Also, if you have dinner reservations you automatically get a seat for the main show in the Mystery Room. After walking out of there $200 poorer, I'm glad I went to experience it and we did have fun, but I will most likely not be going back anytime soon.",3 star rating
1360,10/15/2012,"We were guests of my friends friend. Saturday night was busy we got there at 7:15 and had to wait in line for a bit. Things I noticed;  there was a couple, one of whom was in a wheel chair and left shortly after entering the main room. Is there no elevators in this place?Drinks were not strong. I started getting a buzz after my 3rd drink so yeah very weakly made. We did not have dinner reservations so did not dine in their dinning room however the place smelled good! We did manage to order appetizers at the bar a top of the stairs ( by the dinning room ) garlick fries were garlicky!! Mmmm....so good. A cobb salad was also ordered and well it tasted like a cobb salad.The place was packed and we were only able to make 1 show with Heder something or other it was a nice 15 minute show, very entertaining.Over all we had a nice time but it felt kinda weird, like we were in someone's house having a cocktail party. The $1200 + dues for a membership would be worth it if you really really like magic and can come 2 or 3 times a month to this place.",3 star rating
1361,3/26/2014,"My boyfriend and I attended Magic Castle for New Year's Eve as a guest of another Magician. Cover for the special evening was $25/each and we paid $10 for valet. We did not opt for dinner this evening as it was a special occasion and we wanted to capitalize on seeing as many shows as possible. We arrived early and we were one of the first to enter the castle. The dress code is very strict and given the special occasion, everyone was dressed to impress. The castle was lit up and decorated for the Alice in Wonderland theme and even had a giant mushroom outside the doors! We first caught a couple shows in the close-up room. It was a nice introductory set for the evening. We sang a few songs with Irma, and ordered truffle fries late into the evening from Jeff at the downstairs bar. I'm a VERY picky drinker. I often like drinks so sweet hummingbirds won't touch them. I gave Pilar at the main bar creative freedom to make me a drink ""full of vodka, that only a hummingbird would love"" the pink drink he made was to die for. I made a point to only order them from Pilar and every one was just as good as the last. The drinks were not expensive for mid-range vodka. I had 8 drinks that evening with the truffle fries (which were pretty good also) and my total bill was $60. I left Pilar a large tip for his attentive nature. We danced the evening away and saw a few more shows. Steve Valentine was amazing, his show was modern and fun, leaving even other magicians in awe. David & Leeman were younger contemporary jokesters who had as much fun as we were. Thankfully our audience was participating fully.. I was terrified of not getting in line in time to see Valentine's act. Thankfully, the host John allowed my boyfriend and I access allowing us to sit at the volunteer seats at front of house. We were stars of Valentine's show and like I said the night was TRULY magical. All of the staff I encountered were excited to be there, I met some wonderful people who are part of the society and overall I'd say it was a success. Do not plan on going if you want to take a bunch of pictures, they don't allow photography. Also, it's not a cheap night out so be prepared for that. If you enter the castle with the pretense of having a mystical fun evening you will.",5 star rating
1362,8/20/2012,"Overrated and not all the exclusive to be honest.Everyone I told that I was going here had the same response; ""oh, I've been there... you have to be invited.""   So much for exclusive when all your friends and co-workers have been there...Quick review:Men must be in a suit at all times regardless of how hot you get. You cannot remove your coat.It gets VERY crowded very fast. Get in line EARLY for any of the shows, especially if it's a Sat night.There were some very VERY drunk guests and a couple drunk hecklers during the one show that we were able to get in to.Went once and will not go again.  Too far to drive in LA traffic, too expensive, and too much of a fuss with the fancy dress attire for what it is.  I'm sure back in the 70's it was ""exclusive"" but not anymore.I did end up talking to one of the employee's ""Brian"" who was VERY pleasant.  It turns out he was the manager.  He was certainly trying his best with the big crowd and hot atmosphere.",2 star rating

1365,11/7/2009,"Very enjoyable evening, but surprised at how repetitive the magic acts were (all the main shows the evening we went were card trick based). The food was good but it took us an exceptionally long time to order, be served and pay. I appreciate not having a waiter hurry you along, but this was more like the waiter was just MIA. Heads up too that the interior feels more like a movie set than an actual vintage hotel.

I was lucky enough to watch four very different magic shows. Each one was unique and awesome in its own way. they ranged from small performances with 15-30 people in the the audience to a larger show with close to 150 people in the audience.

1368,11/12/2012,My best friends brother was a magician here before he passed (r.i.p) and there has always been an extended invitation to his family to come whenever they like. Well it was my best friends bday and this is the spot she picked we were all comped on arrival.My meal was so-so the portions were big I can definitely say I was full. Drinks were strong through out the night. This specific night we came the magicians felt like they were trying to be more of a comedian than magician. I definitely was trooping it for my friends benefit I knew it meant a lot for her to come her but to be honest I was ready to go to bed before the clock 12amI like the exclusivity and very 21+ crowd of it all but was kind of disappointed in the talent that night.

1369,1/17/2013,"I had the honor of going to the Magic Castle this past weekend for brunch.  The location is easy to get to, make sure you make a right to get to the castle because a left will take you to the hotel.  An interesting fact we found out before entering the castle is that the Magic Castle Hotel is not affiliated to the Magic Castle. The only thing they have in common is the landlord. We arrived promptly at 11:00 with the reservation of 12:30 brunch. The entrance fee with reservation is $15 a person, which does not include the cost of brunch, obviously.  The only way to park is valet, and this will cost you $8.They will remind you that camera is not allowed once you leave the ticket booth, but it's pretty dark in there for any decent picture anyway.  We had some time to kill before the first magic show, so we wandered around admiring the decoration of each room.  The first magic show is performed by Oliver.  He is a teenager with quite a charm.  I thoroughly enjoyed his show.  We were able to squeeze in one more show before our brunch.  I forgot the magician's name, but she did a great job entertaining the children in the audience.  Now onto the food...the selection for the brunch buffet is not huge, but it is decent that I was able to get a bit of each one.  Some of the food include, omelet station, eggs, bacon, sausage, crab legs, shrimp cocktail, baked salmon, waffles, chicken enchilada, fruit platter, cheese platter, salad, and dessert.  Now, all of that sounds amazing, but I wish I could say the same about the taste.  Everything has been left out in the cold. None of the food was warm beside the chicken enchilada and the freshly made omelet.  The crab legs were too icy to eat.  I was left unimpressed by the food as well as the service. Our server was friendly enough, but he was slow, did not fill our drinks fast enough, and forgot some of our drink orders.    We made our way to the ""grand"" finale in the big theater after brunch. This was supposed to be the 30-minute show with a seasoned magician.  We watched the magician by the last name of Vargas who won an act in China, and he performed his award-winning act.  I'm not going to lie, I thought it was good, but I didn't leave the room wow-ed.  Overall, it was a good experience.  You never know what act you'll see, or who you'll bump into. We sat next to Slash from Guns N Roses during brunch, and that was cool.  Dress code is a bit more relaxed for brunch.  I had on a pair of black slacks with a nice blouse and gone on through with no problem.  I'd probably return for their late night show and skip their dinner if the opportunity arises.",4 star rating
1370,1/2/2011,"This place is truly magical :) I came here on Friday, Dec 17 with my group for our work holiday party and everyone really enjoyed it. The food was actually decent in light of all the horrid reviews I read on Yelp. I got the house salad, which was unfortunately overpowered by the balsamic vinaigrette. Ask for the dressing on the side, or just get the Caesar. The salmon was delicious and you should substitute mashed potatoes for the risotto. The ""warm chocolate cake"" is really a chocolate souffle and it was not warm at all. The ice cream on the side was also more like a watered down frozen yogurt. So actually in retrospect, the food was pretty bad, except for the main entree. The shows on the other hand were awesome! I wish I remembered all the performers' names!! The main show right after dinner was my favorite, the one with the kooky old man with a Texan accent who used to be VP of Magic Castle and the dude who pulled a gazillion birds out of nowhere (presumably his pants). Also, you have to check out the close-up gallery. It blew my mind how I could be in the front row literally a few inches from the card table and not have any idea how he did his tricks. Finally, the guy performing in the Parlour of Prestidigitation was hilarrrrious!!! In summary: I suggest that you eat a light dinner before coming and try to avoid having to have dinner here if at all possible. Also the valet takes dayssssss coming in and especially leaving. But all this is inconsequential in light of how awesome the shows and performers are. Just be prepared to see lots and LOTS of card tricks that will make you cross-eyed and blind. Can't wait to come back!!",5 star rating

This place would be ideal for a 1st or 2nd date because anyone would be impressed by the exclusivity. The rotating magic acts from all over the world are just amazing to see up close and personal. One nightmare that I foresee here is if it gets too crowded. On a Sunday Night, no show would be fully at capacity with minimal waits for the next show. You really need someone to walk you around through here though. A newbie in here would be very lost. Drinks were Hollywood expensive, but hell, you are in Hollywood.",4 star rating

During my classes, I learnt quite a lot about The Magic Castle. There are various activities that attract magic entrepreneurs, enthusiasts and magic lovers.  I love the online gift shop and its choice of products.  Now, I have another source for gifting to my family and friends.  During my course I also found out that the venue is a gourmet's paradise as over the weekend excellent vegetarian and seafood fare is served in an atmosphere reminiscent of the Victorian era.  I particularly liked the entrees that included my favorite, filet mignon.  One more great thing about The Magic Castle is the fact that it is housed in a unique building built on the Chateau-style.

I didn't know of  this place until I went my first time.  I love the classic look and ambiance; everyone dressing up and looking great for a classy event. These are the kind of events I enjoy going to, not clubs where girls practically show everything and leave nothing for imagination. The dinner was absolutely delicious,  expect for the dinner to be pricey  (this is a very exclusive event ). As we walk in to watch the magicians performance, there were some not so great and some absolutely entertaining.

Dwight was an awesome Bartender who served our drinks in the Main Bar. The shows were ok and more like comedy Magicians The only reason I am giving this place 3 stars is because of our burn Burgers that we had to eat. But its a private Club we are lucky to know my neighbor who is one of the Board of directors lucky for us. if you are a guess of a magician you are going to have to buy an Entree to get a ticket to watch the Palace of mystery show which is around 45 minutes long.

Dan dined with us (since he escorted us our cover fees were waived) and gave us a tour and history. We were actually able to meet one of the owners who was there. Not only is this a mecca for the art and all those entertainers who pioneered, but a great venue for young raising stars. The dinner was great, but special mention goes to the shrimp cocktail I ordered. It was mixed with fresh avocado, celantro and fruit (the best thing I've ever eaten). My husband splurged with lobster tail and I had salmon. Others in our party had the sea bass, lamb, filet mignon, and prime rib and no complaints. The shows were great (we went to 3) and got a private close up performance from Dan Bower.

So if you are a male who doesn't own a jacket for whatever reason, know that you could request one at the front desk!I've come on Halloween - it was awesome. There was a coffin filled with Halloween candy.Shows - are ALWAYS amazing! Sometimes some are not necessarily ""magicians"" - there have been jugglers, dancers (with special niches) when I've gone. Incredibly entertaining.Food - the dinner is definitely overpriced. I heard the meat dishes were dry one night I went.

You have to know a member or be a member to get in so it is pretty exclusive and you have to dress the part, but you get to be in small crowds watching live magicians do what they do best, amaze you. Watch out though, they will drag some people from the audience up onto stage and mess with them, as I learnt first hand.I've seen one live magic show before this, in a large theatre in Vegas, which was fun but not much different to watching on TV. Being in a small (50 person?) theatre makes it so much more intimate and so much more amazing that you truly can't believe some of the things you're seeing.There are two downsides. It is expensive, you have to pay for valet parking, pay for entry and unless you're a member you're required to eat dinner which isn't cheap. Also the dinner menu is not great, only a couple of choices and none were particularly well done. A better dinner menu would bump this place up to 5 stars.",4 star rating
1394,11/25/2014,"My husband and I celebrated my birthday here.  We started off with couple of drinks at one place and had a couple more at a different bar. Be sure to talk to the bartenders. They'll recommend food, shows, drinks and they'll share inside stories with you. We watched magic shows and soaked in the atmosphere. We had dinner reservations and enjoyed our meal and company. This place is old Hollywood, glitz, glamour, and mysterious.  The Magic Castle celebrates magicians and their secretive culture in such a fantastic manner. There's a dress code and parking is valet only.",5 star rating

I wore black pants, and a nice white top, and a very nice gray ""Nordstrom"" trench coat (that I wore last year...w/o any problems).  This time, the girl made me take it off and she gave me a ""loaner"" blazer to wear instead (SUPER short jacket....looked really stupid with my outfit)",4 star rating

1399,6/7/2012,"I LOVE THE MAGIC CASTLE!!! I want to be a member! I've gone 4 times in the past 3 months & am a diehard Magic Castle fan. Always a wonderfully special time at this uniquely magical, mysterious, fun-filled place. Expensive but worth it..remember, you're paying for hours & hours of entertainment.GETTING IN: If you don't know someone, try contacting magicians directly & nicely ask if they can get you in. If you take one of their magic classes, you're a member while you're a student, & I hear it's cheaper to become a member that way. I love how it's the Academy of Magical Arts..the closest we'll get to Hogwarts!FIRST-TIME ADVICE: Try to get there early, even if you have a late dinner reservation. Even if you can't, don't stress about trying to see everything..you will see plenty of magic! Everything will be explained & you will figure out how to plan your evening once you get there. The members & staff are so nice & helpful. To fully experience the castle, you have to go more than once, & each time it'll be a different experience, so just enjoy the moment & don't worry about seeing everything like it's Disneyland or something cuz it's not.MAGIC SHOWS: I've been on a Saturday & it was too crazy. We had to wait in line 45 minutes early to see each show. It didn't look like too many members were hanging out there, teaching each other magic tricks, entertaining small groups here & there, which is the best part. I've been on a Monday & it was very easy to get into all of the shows, even the Close Up Gallery last minute. For the first time ever, I was able to catch the early & late shows in the Close Up & Parlour. However, there was a substitute for that week's Palace performer, & there are not as many shows going on. I love going on Fridays! Not as crazy as Saturdays, but still the full roster of magic shows happening throughout the castle, lots of members hanging out.MAGICIANS: Some of my favorite acts are Simon Coronel (the BEST close up magaician I ever saw), Fielding West, David Sandy, Tom Burgoon, Larry Wilson, David Minkin, & Derek Hughes (the BEST I've seen in the Parlour). Sit in the front row if you want a chance at being selected for participation in the show!DINNER: The servers always recommend the steak dishes. I've had the Beef Wellington, the New York Strip, & the Prime Rib & found all of them disappointing. There's a lack of seasoning/salt on the meat, & it's not good when people say they can make a better steak at home, especially at $30+ prices. The rock penne pasta is just ok. I LOVE THE SALMON.APPETIZERS: Everyone likes the garlic bread..it's good, but it's just garlic bread with cheese. The beef carpaccio is just ok. TOUR: I highly recommend going early to get a tour by one of the Knights. Knowing the history makes the castle even more special because there are so many little details, anecdotes, & stories in every corner. Check out the Houdini Seance Room if there's no private dinner. Find the 10 mice in the Hat & Hare Pub. Request a song from Invisible Irma. Ask her what's the saddest song she ever heard.There is so much more to the castle, but everyone should go here at least once to discover it for themselves. I don't intend to divulge any secrets, but rather I hope to help people enjoy their visit as much as possible if it's their first time & be intrigued to visit this place as it so rightly deserves.",5 star rating
1400,2/8/2017,"Welcome to the macic disappointment! We had a party of 10, were told that only 9 can come and surprise: sat at a table for 10 with one guest sitting therefore on her own. Two of the guests (a world famous director werent let in because his black pants had 'pockets' on the side. Noone let us know, so we had three empty seats whilst waiting for the guests to arrive.

1401,6/5/2015,"First review for 2015 and its a good one. I went here with a huge group... 19 I think. I'll start with the negatives first and get them outta the way. Usually having a large group is going to have some confusion and what not, but there was no direction at all from anyone... That was the case for two other parties from what I could tell. Everyone was just crowding around the stairs clueless as to where to go until I asked the busboy... Once we were sat the waitress introduced herself and explained that there were going to be two servers but each would mainly focus on one of our tables unless needed... Ok, makes sense... But we didn't even get our orders taken until after our other table had already been served so now everyone's scrambling to eat and try and catch the rest of said party so we can see the show together. Come to find out it was because our waitress was being yelled at by another separate party for the exact same issue (we decided to let her slide on this) then we were denied Deseret (we were celebrating to bdays) and told to close our bill or we would miss our magic show. Besides that, the food was amazing I had the special which I wouldn't even have know about if I didn't here the other waitress tell our other table, but none the less it was amazing. The place is cool and I'm sure when I return I'll have a 5 star experience. Hey everyone has an off night right? The first magic act was awesome, I enjoyed every part of it... The second and main act was a bit dry, even though the act included magnetized water lol (see what I did there?) I think it was a little rushed but even then it was half way decent and I was still entertained! Then we proceeded to the last act of the night which was mainly rope tricks but this guy killed it, supper funny and really talented. Our party got split up again for this one but they said there was a magician that did a private show for them at the bar and they loved it. This place is members or their guests only, and has a strict dress code so be sure to read the website for what's allowed and not allowed because they do not make accretions even for the ladies... You also do not have to eat dinner but trust me on this, it's the best part. Can't wait to go back and hopefully have something better to update!

1402,9/16/2014,"I went on a Saturday. Standing in the sun on Saturday waiting to get in was a little painful because it was 95 degrees and we had to wait in line for 30 minutes. The food was delicious but it was a little pricey for one person ($40). The magic shows were great. On the weekends, there were younger magicians, which was fine, but it didn't feel as convincing as older magicians. I definitely recommend this place if you've got some extra cash to spare. It's no David Blaine, but it's the next best thing.",4 star rating

We skipped out on dinner since I've read the food was mediocre but pricey and so spent the time walking all around the magic castle. I wish we had more time to stop by all of the shows but all of the bigger shows seemed to quickly fill up after we ended another show :(However, I had a lovely experience here. Hope to come by again.",4 star rating
1404,4/7/2014,"I'm really on the fence about this review. I've been to The Magic Castle (now) twice and had dinner there for the first time this past Saturday evening. The first time I went a few months back (on a Sunday evening), I was in complete awe and couldn't wait to try and get an invite to take my family. I managed to get an invite and booked our reservation back in January - the first available Saturday was 3 months later. I went on and on about how much I loved The Magic Castle and it's so nice to see people so dressed up. Now on to our evening (Saturday night).Our dinner reservation was set for 8:00pm. We arrived about 6:30 to try and catch a show or 2 in first. Well any show that was currently going on was already full.  We went downstairs and got to see Doc Eason for a few minutes - which by the way, he's hilarious! We went to the dinning area for dinner and we were seated in the Dante Room. There was a total of 6 of us. Shortly after we're seated a party of 6 VERY intoxicated girls are seated next to us. Right away they were beyond obnoxious and talking extremely loud. My friend / date leans over to me and says ""I thought you were supposed to behave in here"". Next thing we know, one of the girls is fixing one of her friends hair at the table! My aunt now tells me ""What? Are we in a beauty salon now?"" We had to practically yell at our waitress / hostess so she could hear our order. She was even beginning to get frustrated because she had to keep asking us to repeat ourselves. Once I saw the hair fixing, I'd had it and walked to the front to complain. Minutes later, the girls are now telling each other how awesome they are, high five'ing each other across the table, kissing each others hands and hugging. Like I said, they were extremely intoxicated. The seating hostess walks by and I flag her down. I politely told her that this was getting ridiculous and we can't even enjoy our dinner because these girls are beyond absurd. She says she will send a floor manager over. The manager comes over and basically asks them to keep it down. Minutes later, a party of 8 (or 10) is seated behind us. Another very loud group. I guess the girls figured out that we complained about them and they started to get loud again (and literally yell), trying to be smartas-ses and saying they couldn't hear each other over the new group in the room. One of the drunk girls even sat there staring at us and waved a few times. The floor manager came back over and they began to argue with him and complain about the new table of people. I even heard one of the girls says ""I just don't want to be discrimated against!"" Needless to say, they were either asked to leave or left on their own accord. Too bad by this time we had already ate our food as quickly as possible to try and get the hell out of there. By the time they left, we had already requested the bill. Our entire dinning experience was beyond awful because of these girls. That is how loud, trashy and obnoxious these girls were. We could barely engage in our own conversation, order appetizers, enjoy our dinner, let alone order dessert. We ordered our food, ate as quickly as possible and asked for the bill. I really wish I could tell you that I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. I had the Portobello & Porcini Mushroom Ravioli which was absolutely delicious and the men all had Prime Rib (which they said was great) but again we all ate quickly just to get out of there. We were quite disappointed that they weren't asked to leave / or leave on the own much sooner. We were seated, ordered and ate within 50 minutes.The Magic acts themselves are great to experience but dinner had already set the tone for our evening. For a place that requires such high standards for Dress code, they certainly do not require such high standards from the way people act and carry themselves. Between entrance fees, dinner and drinks, we spent well over $500 (which might not be much to most people there) but we're your everyday, hard working family. This was supposed to be a nice treat and change of pace for us, but sadly it was far from that. The crowd had absolutely no class and our dinning experience was awful. I even saw one lady walking around in her nylons and holding her heels in her hand! My feet were killing me too but I still kept my shoes on! Overall, The Magic Castle has the potential to be a wonderful evening as I experienced the first time on a Sunday evening (but did not have dinner there that night). If you are expecting a nice, classy evening out - do not go on a Saturday night. Save your money and go on a Sunday or during the week.",2 star rating
1405,4/22/2015,"This is definitely one of those places you must go to if you live in Los Angeles, but perhaps a place you just visit once. I went last night for the 2nd time in my life, and the food was better than I remembered, but pricey for sure. If you know a magician, or you're part of an affiliated organization, you can probably get in, but otherwise it will be difficult - if not impossible. Not everyone can make a reservation here, and you usually need to do it a solid month in advance. By the way, I recommend taking an Uber here to avoid the valet charges if you live within 10 miles, plus then you can enjoy their amazing bars too if you're not driving! ;)This historic site is nice to walk around in, and you can catch magic shows in different rooms throughout the evening. You must also come dressed to impressed! They enforce a suite & tie type of dress-code. You can get a picture in out front or near the host stand, but then your camera & phones must be out away. If you haven't been here before, ask around your most connected friends, and chances are you'll find someone that can get you in. Maybe you can even track down some of their magicians online and beg them to get you on their guest list? Just an idea...Overall it's pretty cool, but you'll have a better time if you keep your expectations on the low side.",4 star rating
1406,12/20/2010,"An interesting place to say the least...  My wife and I went in on Sunday this past week.  I figured it was going to be relatively low key, with a smaller crowd.  Uh... we were wrong.  Lines even to pull up to the valet... Fortunately that didn't take long, but that was a sign of things to come. Dinner was actually pretty quick.  We were part of a work dinner and had things pre-selected so that probably helped them out.  After dinner we tried to wander from place to place to find the shows but most were filled.  The one spot we were able to find before the main show we were scheduled for was packed.  People were all wanting to get a good view of the tricks and figure them out so that meant a lot of people behind getting a bit annoyed...The main magic show was actually really fun to watch.  We were in the second row, and so we saw a lot of fishing line attached to the props that probably helped the magicians out, but we still didn't really know how most things were done... Funny acts, though I'm sure the poor magicians can get tired of saying the same jokes over and over...Overall a fun experience that started off a bit tougher because of the crowds, but the main magic show made up for it.",4 star rating
1407,1/8/2011,"Went here last night, my...get ready for this...brothers girlfriends friends boyfriend knows one of the member here. And well yea we got invited, I was with my brother(rod), his girlfriend(Jenn), my sister(Katie), her boyfriend(Edward), my cousin(Christian) and myself. First off coming from Garden Grove, any location located in Hollywood & LA....I hate traffic!!! But on to the point! When we first pulled up to the valet parking, the outside entrance alone gives the best reason on why the attire is formal, its a freakin castle! We got out car's parked, and after some pictures, we walked into the castle. Keep in mind i had harry potter music streaming in my mind, we were greeted, and also got our id's checked and a little look up and down at us to make sure our attire is proper. Loved the fact to enter the magic quarters, you must stand in front of the bookshelf and say Open Sesame! Yup i was like...NAHICE!Got inside and it was pretty packed, people ordering their drinks and what not, then our friend SoRob...thats what he said..So And Rob together, met up with us and well he started off things by giving us a tour of the castle, and seriously you can get lost in there! We ended up watching a small act that was down stairs, and then SoRob gave us a private show as well. Both magicians did their job and made my head hurt for trying to think how they did the stuff they did. We didnt do the dinner, because all of our schedules were weird and what not, but we ended up getting the bar food which was Calamari, Regular French Fries, Truffle Fries And Portobello Mushrooms. The calamari wasn't that great, french friends are fries, I did enjoy the taste of the truffle fries, and Im not a mushroom lover, but I tried it because everyone was saying it was amazing, and I will admit it was pretty damn good. I dont want to ruin anything, but the last magician we saw he actually just got back from the Jimmy Kemmel Show, and wow even as I write this review, and thinking about it..my mind start boggling and hurting, as my smile begins to appear across my face! It was a fun adventure! Most def a must due!!!!",5 star rating
1408,8/2/2015,"Such an awesome place! Awesome shows! Everyone is super nice! You don't have to have dinner reservations to come if you are invited by a member (which is what happened in our case) but if you get hungry, food and drinks are about $15 and up. No pictures allowed unless you're just at the entrance. Dressy but not as dressy as I thought. Some ladies had questionable attire. The only downside was the bathroom that had a broken toilet and a messy floor. Otherwise it was super awesome! Got picked to participate twice so that really made my weekend! This was Junior Magician week and my favorite of the night by far was Mark Gibson. The hamburger and fries were great! Worth the price for sure. My $15 drink was good too, called the Love Concoction.

1410,5/10/2012,"Out of all the languages that I have picked up over the years, I can just simply say that I LOVE THIS PLACE! This place even after all the renovation they did due to last October's electrical fire still is nostalgic as ever. Stepping into that lobby brings back so many memories, even the time when I nearly didn't get in because I wasn't dressed properly but a random stranger had an extra jacket in his car that he lent me with a disclaimer to just leave it with the staff before I left the place. Or the times, when my uncle took me to see Lance Burton, Penn and Teller, The Pendragons, and the immortal NPH, Mr. Neil Patrick Harris himself. I literally felt like a kid again. My mind was boggled with all the illusions my eyes were privileged to see. Always the rationalist, I tried figuring out how the hell did they did such things but my mind ached even more as I pressed on. Nelson, a fellow member of this exclusive club was generous enough to invite a group us for a birthday. Boy oh boy, what a way to celebrate! We saw Tony Montayna, the mentalist, who in a thick Argentinian accent fooled two girls into picking the same pictures and saying the exact same thing he had already written down prior to even the show beginning. Afterwards we went over to see a master close up magician from Germany, who just made Laura S. noggin ache. Ethan, Andre and I all were crying with laughter while in the Palace stage where Greg Wilson just blew away the audience with one of the quickest wit I've ever seen. Ed A impressed me with his random knowledge that he will bring up in a conversation, like when he told the guys that he attended the most recent Magician Award Show. Bridget and JR made waiting line socially great. Would I be back?Yes, I already have an guest pass to come back!",5 star rating

On top of the great food, the magic shows and castle were just as amazing to see. Not a moment of disappointment, but wonder and awe.",5 star rating
1412,8/10/2013,"Went a 2nd time to the Magic Castle last night, and again, had a stupendous time! Love the energy in these eclectic retro parlors. My friend/magician Joel Ward performed in the Palace of Mystery. He was, as usual, phenomenal. Though I love the big showcases, my favorite is the close up magic magicians. Where ever you go, you will see various magicians sitting among the masses showcasing their card, rope, coin and mind reading tricks. It's insanity what silliness you can have here. As far as the food goes, I suggest you eat beforehand. Eating at the restaurant ensures that you will definitely have a seat at one of the big performances but the food is over priced and quite frankly needs a change in chefs. It feels more like a 1980's food institution rather than a nod to the avant garde/retro magic vibe...nor has the food been updated since then. Why not a kale salad? Or vegan options? Or better ingredients? Why the high dish price? When it comes to drinks, however, you'll get a good stiff one that shall get you mighty drunk. So beware...but overall, here's a tip- bring your wallet. :)Beyond the performances and oodling all the dazzling magicians (these peeps are for real good!!), take the time to see the amusement park-like relics, poster art and learn the historical context of the Magic Castle. In of itself, this is too fascinating and dizzyingly good fun!",4 star rating
1413,5/24/2012,"It was once a life time experience! I loved almost every show was on that night. The magicians are not only talented, but having great sense of humour. They are truly trying their best to put on a great show for everyone. But I can't really reveal much about the show. So here I will go into more detail about the food. We were lucky to have the 8pm dinner table booked. I have to say, the dinner is not cheap. But again, after seeing all the shows for free, I don't think anyone would mind to pay a bit more for the dinner, especially they taste good! :) 1)Highly recommend their garlic bread. It sounds simple, but it is the best garlic bread i've never had. its soft, buttery with a hint of cinnamon. yummm. and it has 6 for one portion,so great for sharing. :)2)Truffle fries, I wouldnt really recommend it. It tastes good,but not amazing. I still think Umami burger has the best truffle fries.3)Main, I had salmon and risotto ($39). Great dish, but it was kinda blend for me. I'd prefer some bold flavors. but again,its just personal preference. My friends had penne with chicken, they love it. Tip: everyone has to order one main. so no matter how many side dishes you order, The average price for main is $37 each, and its about $15 per starter and $19 per side dish.",5 star rating
1414,7/14/2014,"Okay, so i loved Magic Castle, and wish i could afford to hang out there more often. But i just wanted to share my story about Irma, since i haven't heard any similar experiences. Irma is the resident ghost who plays the piano, and will play any song you request! She even answers questions with low angry ""no"" chords, or a high-low, ""may-be"" sound. A lot of people have been saying Irma is a ""player piano"" or responds to ""voice commands"", as if she's a computer. She's not!After requesting a couple songs (including Eminem!), i asked ""Irma, do you think we could play a duet?"" and she said (on the piano) ""May-be"". And i asked ""How about Heart and Soul?"" and she jumped right into it. I went to the top of the piano and tried to join in, but she was playing in F, and i was fumbling. I said ""uhhh can we play it in C?"" and (perhaps begrudgingly) Irma switched keys for me!! I was playing on the high end of the piano to stay out of her way, when she stopped playing and hit the note i was on, dragging down to the middle of the piano. I was startled for as second, but she did it two more times, as if suggesting ""Come on, play down here!"" So i hesitantly moved to the middle of the piano, and continued playing, and Irma played on either side of my hand!! She was responding to me, waiting for me when i messed up, reacting.. there was no way this was a pre-recorded performance.I'm not even sure if duets are technically allowed.. maybe Irma just liked me enough to let it slide. But it was the most magical experience i've had since i was a kid. Thanks so much to Magic Castle and however they made the ghost pianist happen! (Be it another pianist or Irma herself!)

1416,12/19/2016,"APPALLING. We blew over $600 at the Magic Castle to take our friends, and even had to book a room at the adjacent Hotel for the privilege of paying full price to get in, and it was AWFUL. We only got to see ONE show -- and we didn't even have a choice of which one! This breaks down to $150/per person -- for ONE 45 minute show. The other shows are all scheduled to start at the same time so there is (intentionally) no way you can see even half of them. In our case, we ran immediately to the next line only to have the door shut in our face, by which time we had missed the other shows starting at the same time. Then we stood in a THIRD line & the ""magician"" was 20 minutes late, and only performed for 8 minutes (literally -- after waiting an HOUR in line) by which time we missed the last show of the night. His 8 minute show, btw, was a tepid repeat of the FIRST show we saw.  There is not a damn thing to do while waiting in line for shows you won't get in to see. The decor is old & tawdry, and there are NO little magic shows going on AT ALL besides the scheduled ones. The food is inedible (& wildly overpriced); the drinks watered down; and they treat their guests like cattle. If you want to get insulted & abused, you can go to an S&M Dungeon for WAY less money (& probably better props).",1 star rating
1417,6/14/2017,"I came to The Magic Castle as a guest of a magician so I didn't have to pay the entrance fee or eat here.  We had reserved seats at the 8pm show in the bigger theater but with traffic and taking a few pics in the lobby we arrived at the theater at exactly 8pm.  The show bouncer said our seats were given away five minutes ago.  He was kind of rude about it but he made up for it by talking to my magician friend and getting us seats for the 9pm show.  My favorite spot there is probably the bar downstairs with the magician at the bar.  Also, if you see a photo booth make sure to go inside.  And the piano room with Irma is super cool.  Even though we haven't eaten here I would like to next time.  I hear it's expensive but what I saw looked really good.  When you come, definitely expect a late night and pricey drinks.  But all the bartenders were really cool and someone pointed out the owner of the joint to us.  We spoke with a few people who were members and it was really interesting to hear about the place from people who have been going for 30+ years.",5 star rating
1418,5/4/2017,"I'll be honest, the magic was really cool.  It is definitely worthwhile to do this at least once in your LA life.  The reason for the 3 stars?  I felt like it was overpriced and very heavy with the ""NO"" rules.  I get not taking pictures of the magicians, but not of your friends? at dinner? when no magicians are around?  And I don't understand the ""you have to buy dinner or we'll charge you an additional $50"".  WHY.  Maybe I'm a snob for working in the restaurant industry, but if you're going to have $40+ priced entrees and ""fine dining"" service, well then I expect top notch food for what I'm paying.  I also expect my charger plates to be polished and not have a visible greasy film nor have the bottom of my water glass be so severely chipped that it's hazardous to even touch, or have to polish my own wine glass.  For me, I found the food and by the glass wine list to be mediocre at best. The bill was even more irritating to swallow making the shows following it less enjoyable.  Maybe the Magic Castle needs to find a better balance in customer experience.  Definitely a menu revamp to pull it out of the 90s.",3 star rating

1420,4/30/2012,"I figured for my first Yelp review I better make it something special.  My girlfriend and I were invited by friends of the family to a magical evening at the Magic Castle.  Overall, it was pretty damn impressive, but I would've given it 3.5 stars rather than 4.Parking: $8, and you have to valet it.  If you're going on a weekend, like my girlfriend and I, expect a wait when you want to get your car back.  Also, be proud if you drive something that cost less than $50,000.  You're already different than most people there!Ambiance: Awesome.  If you like swankyness and classyness, this is your place.   Lots of places to wander and explore.  However, some things did detract from the ambiance.  The music being played was mostly modern music.  This didn't fit the atmosphere at all.  I expected jazz, big band type of music.  That being said, it's still a great place for a date.Food: The most important part.  The food was very good.  Was it the best meal I've ever had?  No, but it was still pretty darn good.  I had the rack of lamb, medium rare.  The lamb and risotto were delicious.  The veggies were a little al dente.  My girlfriend had the New York steak, and it was buttery goodness.  Others had the Prime Rib, Beef Wellington, soft shell crab and other dishes.  Nobody disliked their food.  Prices for a main dish were on average $35ish.  Their menu is online.  If it's just two of you, don't expect to get out for under $100.Show: Alright.  The big show.  The show was entertaining.  However, again, small things detracted from the overall experience.  The main theater has folding chairs for seats.  Granted, the seats are cushioned, but if I was a paying member, I'd want something to be comfortable in.Beer review: Magic Castle had three beers on tap: Stella Artois, Blue Moon and Firestone Walker Double Barrel Ale.  I didn't ask to see if they had any beer in bottles, so I had the DBA of course, which I was excited to see.  My one beef was they served the beer in the wrong glass.  They served an English Pale Ale in a Pilsner glass.  A minor quibble, but I would expect them to know what they're doing.The alcohol selection looked nice, but the prices were pretty steep.  This shouldn't be a surprise though.  When you go to the Magic Castle, expect to pay some money.  Also, I'd take the hostess's advice and come on a weeknight.  It got pretty packed after 9pm.Overall, a nice dining experience, but I wouldn't pay to be a member.",3 star rating

1425,4/17/2012,"WOWWWWFirst of all, this place is actually a CASTLE!Just being able to go to the Magic Castle was a dream come true for me.  There have been two places that I have wanted to go to - Club 33 and the Magic Castle - and in the past year I got to go to both!The Magic Castle, as most of us know, is an exclusive club and getting to go here isn't exactly just a walk through the door.  In fact, in order to get passed the lobby you need to know a secret password!Okay, so here's how it went down for my friends and me.  We got to the Magic Castle at around 6-6:30 p.m. and drove up the driveway where we were greeted by the valet-men.   A friend of ours is a magician that was performing that night, and we had the privilege to come visit him and see him perform.  There's a fairly strict dress code that all guests must abide by; and it's no surprise when you find out who the president of the castle is.  SUIT UP!  The website even says, think business!Our friend wasn't performing until 10 p.m.  So we had plenty of time to wander around and see some shows.  After a couple pricey, but STRONG, drinks at the bar, we tried to make our way to a couple shows.  We asked the bartender the best approach to watching the shows and he gave us a couple tips on hopping from show to show to maximize our efficiency.Since we came a little past 6 p.m. we weren't able to make it to the first show.  So we were referred to the Parlor of Prestidigitation.  Not only was the first magician great at what he did, he was charismatic and entertaining as well!  He had a couple of jokes that had me rolling.After his show we made our way to the Main Showroom where three magicians were set to perform.  Even though they were supposed to be the main event of the night, I think the other magicians did much better.  The first two were more comedians than magicians and performed a trick apiece.  The last performance, however, did blow our mind.  It was a female magician that didn't use any words but still kept the crowd captivated.We had some time to kill after that show, so we made our way over to Irma to hear a couple tunes.  Irma is the castle's ghost pianist who plays almost any song that you request!  Don't forget to leave a tip!  I got her to play Frank Sinatra's Strangers in the Night and after the song played it was time for OUR main event!Our friend performed in an ""Up-Close"" room and put on a show that not only surprised us; it blew us a way!  It was a given that his magic was EXTRAORDINARY, but his showmanship throughout the process...  Flawless.  Just being able to see his show was definitely a blessing!After his first performance, we were able to see another show while he performed for the rest of the night.  We moseyed on back to the first magician we saw, because supposedly he was performing a completely different act.Before we left, my girlfriend got a picture of the two of us, which came with a guest pass for another visit!  The cameraman was extremely friendly and chatted with us for a bit while we waited for our souvenir to print.My group and I had such a great time and I can't wait to come back!  If all goes well, we might get to run into the president of the castle the next time we visit!",5 star rating
1426,2/25/2014,"I have loved this place for 20 years, but the last couple of visits were pretty bland. The magicians are all incredible, but the management seems interested in jamming the place full so it's impossible to see a show. They started charging a 30 dollar cover, which would be a bargain if we got to see more than one show. We waited 45 minutes for a show, only to see people (friends of the magicians?) whisked past the lne, so once up front we were told there was no room. And later, other people were waiting in line at 10PM for the 11:15 show. Until they focus less on serving mandatory 40 dollar entrees and more on letting people see the magic, I will find my magic elsewhere.",2 star rating

1428,6/7/2010,"I've been to the brunch two times in my life.  Once when I was younger than 16 (probably closer to 13) and thought the experience was amazing.  I remember the close up magic being really good, the food being awesome, and there being mimosas (they were good too :)The second time I went was a couple of months ago with my wife and her parents when they were visiting from out of town.  This time the food was still very good, there were still mimosas, but I got to see the price of the experience (way high!) and the magic was more targeted for kids (which is probably why I liked it so much the first time).I have a feeling that the evening experience that you need special access to would be very different from the public Sunday brunches, so my review is solely on the two brunches I have had and being older I have a very different perspective.  So...Summary: Sunday brunch has great food, very expensive, good mimosas, and magic targeted for the younger crowd.  If you have kids and want to take them to a magical and expensive experience, go for it.  If you're hosting the in-laws, not so much.",3 star rating

1431,7/2/2014,"Severely over-rated. I'd put a barely visible half star rating if possible.Sincerely sorry to say so, it missed the mark entirely when it came to dining... and one cannot ""get away from"" dining here; it is an entrance requirement (along with $20 per person upon entering the lobby).The food was mediocre at best. Service (or kitchen preparation?)  was poor. Three appetizers out of our four, made it to our table at the same time our entrees were being delivered to us and semi - cold upon serving. Seriously embarassing for us and our guests from Europe. Our party of four had expectations of a solidly entertaining evening along with a (hopefully, since we hadn't been there before) palatable meal. We hoped for the best though did not imagine the worst from a ""world-renown"" establishment. All this and yet, our evening concluded with what was touted as the swan song of his career, The Amazing Jonathan - again, sincerely sorry to say, he was neither amazing nor (even) a magician! What?! Yes, that's right, this ""world-renown"" venue to which we paid the big bucks to be wined, dined and entertained, didn't inform the patrons that the main event is a comic. Please, how would I have known at the MAGIC Castle, we needed to ask if the headline act was a magician or retiring comic? If comedy was what we signed on for, there is an excellent venue down the way (pretty certain, I would not be seeing magicians at the Comedy Club).Anyway, we literally kept waiting for the ""magic to happen"" and it didn't. Even after dinner, we were hopeful, yet more embarassment for us (and our guests though we obviously tried to make light of it all, considering....)  Disappointed all the way around and who'd have thought so, after all, it is ""THE"" Magic Castle - go figure.",1 star rating
1432,9/6/2014,Waste of money. They act like its a freaking amusement park ride for every magic show. We waited nearly one hour in line to enter a 15x15 room for a close up magic show. Not worth your money. Not to mention you have secret spies looking over your shoulder whenever you pull out your phone threatening to kick you out. Ni**a you don't t work for the CIA so sit the heyall down. Food was below average for nearly $40 a person (a requirement per reservation by the way).  Plus they purposely place an extra percentage of alcohol per drink to get you wasted and enjoy the shows a lot better.,1 star rating
1433,2/6/2013,"I had my anniversary with my wife here and we both had a blast. We came on a Monday night based on the suggestions of some yelpers not to come on the weekend. Overall we had a lot of fun and the food was great too.One thing I was happy about was that they enforce the dress code. One lady came in with jeans and a shirt and the girl up front told her she had to change. Which made me happy, one person dressing badly can totally break the illusion... No pun intended.Dinner at the magic castle will guarantee you seating at one of the shows, they even give you tickets. The food was good and it definitely did not taste like a $20 meal, but rather a more expensive meal. My wife had the ribeye ($38) and it was amazing! Entrees start at $27 so save your money.The magic shows were fun and enjoyable. Did not have a problem with seating since it was a Monday night.Part of the fun was exploring the castle. The ambiance makes you feel like you are in some weird semi European mansion in the 1920s.A few words of advice for this place:- if you are younger then you might want to go on a weekend. It was all most too quiet and empty at 11pm at the magic castle on a Monday night - this place is cute for couples, make sure you save ahead of time- make reservations early - get there early and have some drinks while you are watching a magic show before dinner- food takes forever, so make sure you eat something beforehandFor those of you trying to get in here, it really isn't that hard. Do a search for the magicians that are performing and tell them how much you want to come to The magic castle. More than likely they will send you an invitation.",4 star rating

1436,6/3/2010,"I went on a wednesday night, and it was filed with people both at dinner and the shows. It is upscale attire (gentleman slacks, button up shirt, tie and ladies cocktail dresses) they will NOT let you in if you have jeans on or tennis shoes unless it is for medical reasons which manager had to approve.The food was actually delicious, got the pan seared salmon with the side salad, spinach and mushroom sides. LOVED IT! I have heard their food isn't the greatest, but  I would disagree taste home made and that's what i like. Not just a fancy looking dish.The magic is a combination of comedy and magic. They interacted with the audience and was very entertaining but did not like constantly waiting to catch the next show, need to make a better schedule for that. We missed the next show by 1 minute since the previous room went over and had to wait 45 minutes for the next show which is a big negative.Overrall, it is a place to check out at least once, it is definitely an experience and a night of fun.

1438,12/28/2012,"I have been a hobby magician most of my life, so the Magic Castle has always been high on my bucket list. It did not disappoint.We went on a Saturday night, so the place was busy, but all the staff were courteous and friendly. Dinner was above average for an upscale restaurant and the bar was generous with their drinks.The magic show in the main theater was, as you would expect, world class, and the building is filled with interesting nooks and crannies with museum-grade magic artifacts on display. Close up magic was being performed in several locations around the Castle and I was fortunate to sit at a small table and watch the amazing work of magic legend Howard Hamburg.If you view magic as a puzzle to be solved, not as a performing art or if you think the Castle is a cool place to go just because it is private, then it is not for you. If you enjoy high quality entertainment, good food, and great history, then do what you can to wrangle an invitation. The experience is well worth the effort.",5 star rating

1443,1/29/2017,"This review is based on the Saturday brunch.  The place itself is really neat.  I thought it would be bigger, but it's still fun to walk around and look at things.  Just be warned that the rooms are cramped, with low ceilings.  They really pack the people in, too.  Overwhelming at times.  We saw a close up show in a small room, which was nice.  The young magician was good and entertained us!  I think we all enjoyed that one.  Brunch food was pretty good.  I would've liked a larger selection, in a larger room.  Again, people are just crammed in there like sardines.  The prime rib is hand cut into the thinnest piece ever.  I picked up a plate to use and it was filthy on the back of it.  There were kids everywhere so if you're not into that, don't go during brunch.  Also, the kids buffet is tiny.  I think it had five items on it.  I've been to much, much better buffets for the same price.  The last show we saw was alright.  A bit on the cheesy side but it was only thirty minutes long so it was fine.  All in all, it was something to experience and check out but I don't think any of us would go back.",2 star rating

1445,12/1/2011,"It's magic and member's only.  What's not to love?  I've been lucky enough to be invited to the Magic Castle twice.  This trip wasn't as fabulous as last time I was there in 2008.  My first review would have easily been 5 stars, but unfortunately since then there has been a fire destroying a large piece of the property.   I'm afraid the Castle lost a lot of its flair in the fire.  Let me explain...A typical trip to the Magic Castle involves dinner and then several magic shows throughout the place.  The kitchen at the Castle is fantastic.  In 2008 I clearly remember enjoying my dinner of lobster, fillet mignon, wine, in the Seance room... It was terrific.  Imagine my surprise on this visit when we arrived for dinner and were lead to a crowded, under ground, low ceiling living room/ lounge type space, where everyone visiting the Castle on this particular Saturday night stood in a long and incredibly slow moving buffet line.  Yes, a buffet.  Um- question.  Do I look like someone who goes to buffets?  Don't answer that.  I'll just tell you, the answer is NO.  Standing in a crowded stuffy room with a bunch of hungry people holding my own plate while wearing a cocktail dress, heels and satin clutch under my arm is definitely NOT my idea of a good time.  I don't care how fabulous the spread at the buffet.  This is the opposite of fabulous old Hollywood prestige that the Magic Castle is reminiscent of...  We were in line for at least 45 minutes...  After we got our food from the meal line (eye roll) we had to walk up several stairs to find a spot to eat!!  The bar upstairs had room for me and my girlfriend.  The boys had to stand and eat but at this point I didn't care.  I ordered a Rodney Strong Cabernet Sauvignon from the bar and was a happy girl again.  What can I say, it doesn't take much :-) After the disappointing dinner fiasco, it was time for the shows.  The Magic is totally Ah-mazing!  Seriously- How do they do that?!   There were several world class acts performing that night, including one couple that I saw featured on Oprah a couple years ago.  All the shows blew my mind every time.  Admittingly, I do have a childlike amazement at this type of show but still, the talent and mystery of these tricks is just truly surprising, astonishing, bewildering, and just- WOW!!  Happy clapping and huge smile was on my face for the rest of the night.  The vodka and wine never hurts to make these magicians that much more amazing.  Just saying.  Over all the Magic Castle is going to be a YES, obviously thanks to the talent of the magicians!  How else could I have had that whack dining experience and still have given this place 4 stars?  It really is the magic that keeps this place one of the highlights and landmarks in LA.  I can't wait to come back after the whole place is open again and enjoy the 5 star restaurant and service that was lacking on this last visit.  *strick dress code- gentlemen must have their jackets on at all times*valet is $8*no photography allowed",4 star rating

1447,2/11/2013,"OMG!!! Loved it here!!!!Came as a guest of a friend who had a friend who was friends with a Magician (LOL). Came by on a Saturday night, our magician asked us to get here by 6 so that we can bypass the night crowd for a tour of the castle. We also didn't need to make dinner reservations either. Had already heard the bar food was better than the actual dinner so we just ordered a bunch of finger foods and had a ball. What I thought was the best part about the whole place.. a magician in every nook and cranny of the place. Even while you're grabbing a drink, take a seat because there are magicians behind the bars, ready to blow your mind all over again. Oh sure, there are the scheduled acts.. but the delight comes in the form of finding a room with a magician. Upon introducing yourself, they take you along into their world of ""MIND-BLOWN."" There were so many ""OMGAWWWWWD"" moments, the magician seemed to  get a kick out of the group of overreacting asians that, I swear, he did 10 extra magic tricks that would REALLY WOW US. LOVE IT!!Ropes and cards and drinks and rooms and memorabilia's and caricatures and stairs and stairs and more stairs.. At one point, I thought we must have gone down 3 flights of stairs underground.. only to find out it was the same landing as the entrance. ""WHAAAA??""

1449,1/19/2010,"This place is quite exclusive and expensive but worth a try! You'll need a guest pass from a magician/member in order to enter. A guest pass can work for a group of people. The shows were amazing and entertaining. I like the close-ups where the magician perform their best tricks within 3 feet from you. All the performers were very talented. The cool part is that you'll be surrounded by magicians or comedians. Aspiring magicians often have a chance to learn tricks or tips in the hallways.  There is a $20 entrance fee with the guest pass.As for FOOD: I had dinner at Magic CastleIN MY STOMACH: House (complimentary) Bread, Lamb Racks w/baby squash and risotto, New York Steak w/mashed potato, Chicken and a Chili BowlIN MY MIND: Expensive meal but quality food. I paid probably 30-40 dollars for Lamb Racks w/ baby squash and risotto. The prices are about the same for the Steak. The lamb racks were tender and juicy. It's definitely one of the best i've tried. The risotto was a little too salty, so if possible switch the risotto for mashed potatoes. The Chili bowl was delicious, it will amaze your palette. The house bread is okay, not too great. The Chicken is a little dry. Overall, this dinner is on the expensive side but quality is great. Servers wore penguin suits and were very friendly. . They offer Valet Parking for $8 so no parking problem. It's a Fun and Magical Experience but not a place to go everyday, perhaps once is suffice.",4 star rating
1450,12/4/2013,"I came here to pick up my girlfriend after she attended the castle with her friends. I drove up to the front and inquired, politely, how or where I should wait to pick up one of the guests who would be getting out any minute. The man working the front door was exceptionally rude to me and provided no assistance. He told me I had to leave and that I could not pick up the guest, park or wait there. I calmly asked what he suggest that I do since I was simply there to pick up a guest. He responded simply with ""I don't fucking know. Go away."" At that point, I was simply confused and asked again what I can do to make this easier for everyone, as my girlfriend would be stepping out of the door any second, and he told me to go park somewhere else. At this point, I realized that I wasn't going to get anywhere with this awful person. So I said, ""OK, fine, I'll figure something out on my own."" So I pulled to the side next to some other park vehicles to wait. The rude doorman/bouncer did not seem to really care, which made that whole awful exchange seem rather unnecessary and stupid. My girlfriend came out very soon after that, and we left. I am not sure why the exchange was so rude from the employee of the Magic Castle. I would expect at least some modicum of professional conduct from such a well-known and famous attraction. I will never recommend the Magic Castle to anyone and will never attend personally.

1451,12/10/2013,"I went to the Magic Castle last night and I couldn't have been more excited!  I had always wanted to go and from the minute I stepped in to the beautiful lobby, I thought it was going to be an amazing evening.First thing first, I wanted to get a drink.  I met up with some friends who were in the back of the line for a magic show, after getting a glass of wine my date and I joined them.  A gentleman asked how many in our party and we said 6 people.  He informed us that we would be able to see the next show.  So after waiting for 45 minutes in line, we got to the front and he said he only had 5 more spots inside the room.  That's strange because we were a party of 6 which he knew and said he could accommodate.  After the guy said we would have to wait another 45 minutes for the next show, my date and I decided to go off on our own and explore the castle and find some other magic shows, but much to our disappointment, there was no magic happening in the Magic Castle.  I never even saw a bartender do a card trick like some other people on here did!  My friends that went and saw the show we were standing in line for, said they had to stand the whole time as there were no seats available and one of the girls that was picked from the crowd to participate in the magic show is an employee at the castle.The food: I got the salmon which was awful, I read another review on here, where a girl also got the salmon and did not like it.  If you don't eat meat and only eat fish, I highly suggest you go with the vegetarian option.  Everyone else at my table loved their dishes.  I tasted the chicken and it was actually really good, I wished I had ordered that instead.  I ordered the caesar salad and banana cream pie for dessert, those were also very good.  The garlic, cheesy bread and fries were good as appetizers, but how can you really mess up fries and garlic bread?  After dinner we saw the main magic show with magician Ed Alonzo.  He starts off his act showing a video of himself working with Michael Jackson, Britney Spears and his numerous appearances on Ellen.  I'm not sure if this video was supposed to impress the audience or if it's really just played to inflate Ed's huge head and ego!  I thought I would be wowed and amazed by the magic considering Ed has done so much work with such big names, but instead, out came a sloppy magician with terrible racist jokes, who had fake blood on his fingers from his last show for his cutting arm trick.  There is a part of the show where he levitates a crumpled piece of paper, which you could clearly see the wires that it was hanging from.  There was a guy in the audience who made a joke with Ed and he seemed so offended and clearly was unable to take jokes for the simple fact that he kept egging him on.  He kept on harassing the guy in the crowd, so when the guy made another joke, he kicked him out.  Ed was on a power trip and it seemed like that was his plan all along.  As I exited the awful show, I saw Ed approach the lady that was with the gentleman he kicked out and berate her in front of the audience members.  It was terrible, he was yelling at her and had his finger in her face.  He was being so disrespectful and degrading to someone who didn't say anything during his show.  If he was still so upset and bothered by the jokester, then he should have sought him out instead of again having a power trip on a woman and humiliating her.",1 star rating

1456,3/4/2012,"I went to the Magic Castle a few weeks ago for a friend's birthday. It was my 3rd time going, and I thought it was a-ok.What I loved:- Getting dressed up- Going out on the town and doing something different- People watching- Friendly bartenders and waitstaff- We didn't have to pay any cover charge- Valet parking so I don't have to think about my carWhat I didn't love so much:- Food was average- Expensive drinks- Main show still seemed a little 1985, more comedic than magic- We tried to get into the close-up room, line looked open and then some dude who worked there said the line was full - huh?- Small upstairs bar was ""closed"" although it looked like there was a bartender back there serving. Maybe that bar was only for magicians? If you haven't been, you should check it out. I'd go again if invited and would be more intentional about visiting the other rooms.

1460,4/20/2013,"Went two nights ago with my friends, who got a guest pass at Magic Castle. I had been hearing a lot about this place so I was very excited to go!We got there at 7:30 for an 8:00 seating, so we weren't able to see a show prior to dinner. However we were entertained by the magic piano that plays any song you verbally request. She played sweet caroline for us! it was great!We then went to the main show room, and saw the 45 min show. This was so fun, it was two magicians with a host throughout that did various magic for us too. The host is the host from cupcake wars, he was hilarious! The first magician was a woman that did a lot of fire magic, it was really interesting. The second magician was from taiwan, and he did a lot of beautiful card magic. The host picked one of our group members on stage as a volunteer, and that entertained us quite a bit. We went to the close-up gallery for our second show, and that was awesome too. It's a very small room so I recommend you get there early, only 20 people can go in, and the line fills up fast. It's worth the wait though because you get to go really up close and personal with the magician.Food: Steak, pasta, chicken, fish on the menu. I got the filet mignon with mashed potatoes, it was delicious. We weren't going for the food, but the food was actually quite good. The filet was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the mash was buttery and garlicky. Don't forget to ask for horseradish..its delicious with it. My friend got the lobster ravioli, that was really good too!I would definitely go back again :)",5 star rating

The MC is more a social club than a magic place but worth it to visit. If you don't pay for your dinner , you should line up for a while to get in the show rooms.You can get in by a friend who is a member of the Castle or booking a dinner.Magic Castle seems a place with a lot of mystery , if you use to go there quiet often you can see some relevant magicians and artists , just walking around the Castle is possible to sit next to a magician so he will do a magic trick just for you.

1466,12/11/2013,"I was invited as a guest for a friend's company party.  It was very crowed and confusing.  We stood in line for 45 minutes tor one of the magic shows. An employee asked how many were in our party. We said ""six"".  He said, we need to get all our party together right away to ensure we all get seated, which we did.  When the show was about to start, he asked us again how many in our party.  We again said ""six"". He said  ""Sorry, there's only room for 5 and they all have to stand.""  We told him he said he could seat all six of us, but he didn't seem to care and said, ""You can stand or wait another 45 minutes for the next show""!  Five of us did stay, but the show was not very good. The magician dropped things and had to rush behind the curtain to shut off some inadvertent music that started to play in error.  Then he asked for volunteers from the audience.  It seemed like one of the so-called volunteers was actually an employee. She turned to the audience and said, ""Believe me, I'm not part of this,""  but we saw her earlier in another parlor giving people advice on what to see and where to go. She put a dollar in a bird cage, and the piano mysteriously started playing. Then later, we saw her in line for the early main magic show. I wouldn't doubt if she was another 'volunteer' from the audience. After dinner, we were scheduled to see the main magic show, The Great Alonzo!  This was the worst part of the evening.  We had to sit through the magician's sloppy magic tricks, sarcastic jabs and racial innuendos toward audience members.  In the beginning of the show, one of the audience members said something funny and the magician responded. It seemed liked he was attempting to engage with that person, as part of the show.  But, he was clearly ticked off, because throughout the show, he kept making jabs at that person, even though the person did not say anything else. He continued to egg that person on.  Then, in his routine, he said, ""Yeah, like Santa Clause over there seemed to think he would help in my routine."" (The audience member had a white beard & white hair)  After many references to him, the audience member finally said, ""Well you needed it!"".  Everyone laughed, but the magician got off the stage and asked the man to stand, which he would not do. The magician took the member by the hands and tried to pull him up from his seat and the guy asked where they were going.  The magician said, ""We aren't going anywhere, YOU ARE LEAVING NOW!"".  Then he went and got a bouncer to escort the person out. It was so uncomfortable and absolutely not entertaining in the least.  I don't think it was that magician's finest hour.  I was embarrassed for the audience members who were picked on, especially the person who was escorted out. I will not return to the Magic Castle, nor recommend it to anyone.",1 star rating

They hassled us about our dress code and then at the dinner table proceeded to ask orders from the men at the table before the women. A true etiquette faux pas.The staff was awful the food mediocre and the magic sub par.During one of the magic shows I could see where the magician was pulling cards out of his sleeve it was discouraging to see the reveal before it happened.I wouldn't recommend this experience  to anyone it's not wort the money and it's not a cool date,1 star rating

Huge waste of money for the experience!!! $30 to get in and over $100 a person for drinks and dinner alone-no thank you! In the dining room we decided we wanted a burger to find out they will charge you the price of a $40 steak! (Which is $16 in the bar). NOT FAIR! Also if you go with a huge party they will NOT split the bill for you. Drinks are $10-$15 a piece. RIP OFF. The shows aren't even THAT great..maybe it's because I'm in my late twenties but there were quite a few older people who seemed like they were having a great time. Even after you wait in line for a show you aren't even guaranteed to get in. You spend all this money to go inside and then can't even make it in to see the magicians!

1481,1/24/2014,"As a magician for almost 16 years, the Magic Castle was one of the best experiences of my life. We all know you have to be a member or be invaded by one to attend this historic house of magic. I really enjoyed the food. My friend had the fish tacos, i had the magic burger, and we split truffle fries. The food was good and enjoyable. We saw Justin Willman and Kalin & Jinger. Their were other magicians, but they were the most memorable that particular night. Since Kalin & Jinger were a popular act (especially for magicians), the overflow seating line was getting packed.  All though my experience was great, I had the concerns for other people. When we were waiting in line, my friend and I were the last group of people go go in. In front of us was a group of ten and a couple of two. I really don't know what happened between the groups exactly, but the couple was getting pissed off that the group of 10 were cutting in front of them. You see one of the group members waited in line while the others got drinks. My best guess was it was more than 10 and they were worried they wouldn't make it to the 10:00 P.M. show.  A verbal fight broke out between the two groups and the security was stand their doing nothing. Maybe they were getting prepared for a fist fight, but it was uncertain. All though the couple, the group of 10, another couple, my friend and I were able to see the show. I couldn't help but wonder what would of happened if things got out of hand. My Personal advice for the management of the Castle on how to fix a problem like this:For the overflow seating, If your group is not in the line, you wouldn't be permitted into the show. Even though you give people who had dinner reservations tickets to see the show, you should also have a number system for the overflow as well as other show rooms at the Castle. That way it would help the ushers and start the show on time. The fact that you didn't have this particular situation under control which would jeopardize the safety of the parties involved as well as the other members and guest at the Castle, I had to dock one star on this review. I would highly recommend the Magic Castle to anyone who can get invited to this place. It is a life changing experience that will have you talking for days about it.",4 star rating

1483,12/13/2017,"Magic Castle seems to have magically snatched up all the magicians living in Los Angeles (or visiting) and put them all under one historic venue. With a rotating assortment of guest magicians, you never know exactly what to expect when showing up here. On a similar note, the ever changing dress code seems to magically change on a weekly basis becoming more strict with each addition. Like the crusty bouncers waiting to deny you at the door, the dress code feels out dated and behind the times particularly in a city known for it's laid back vibes. Inconsistent at best, allowing some dress code breakers through the door while denying others this place could use a refresh. While the magicians are incredible, the food and strict requirements feel extremely outdated. If you get an opportunity to go, you should, but it might make sense to call ahead as their dress code requirements vary depending which of their platforms you are looking on.",2 star rating

You couldn't even get to the other shows, because there weren't enough seats. I was standing in line so close to another person it seemed like we were sardines in a can. The food isn't even that good, way overpriced, and we only saw our waiter twice, when he asked for our orders, and when he brought it.

1487,10/7/2011,"Hey remember that late 90's show Magic's Biggest Secrets Revealed?....Yeah me neither. Ever wanted to see a really really really good looking magic show, and not some lame birthday magician? Well look no further than the Hollywood Hills for the always excellent Magic Castle. FYI though this is a private club, you need either an invitation from a member or stay at the hotel to receive a pass. Please do not attempt to storm the castle or you will promptly be used for their next disappearing act. The first time I came here was through a member invitation and as such was required to attend dinner. The Dinner menu consists mostly continental food and the price ranges fall between $20-40 per dish (Hey they have to make money somewhere). Food quality was so-so. The dessert on the other hand was actually pretty good, and man they give you a huge portion! Dessert will set you back about $8 a plate. Now for the reason why I gave this place 5 stars: The shows rock! You have some seriously talented magicians providing some fun,  hilarious, shows. I actually don't want to talk about this place anymore...maybe you should stop making fun of the kid practicing magic at the park and be his friend....you just might get a VIP pass to this very exclusive club! Some tips: -Guys....please follow the dress code rules! Don't do what I did and forget to put on a tie. Even with slacks and a jacket I could not go in without a tie...you will have to wear a loaner. -The secret code is not abracadabra...-Plan out which shows to visit and give yourself plenty of time to line up before a show...this will save you from missing shows and or getting stuck with lame seats.",5 star rating

1489,7/21/2013,"I have visited ""The Castle"" on many occasions and highly recommend the dinner and shows.  This weekend we were able to take advantage of some additional shows at the bar.When friends visit from out of town, they have a great time as the experience is ""old Hollywood"" and entertaining.Specifically, you should make reservations on a weekend night and arrive early.  There are many shows and adhoc magicians roaming the halls.Upside/downside:  The dress code is cocktail attire and strictly enforced.  Plan accordingly.",5 star rating
1490,5/29/2013,"If you like to be mystified, this is a great place for you to go. There is always several magicians performing in several different rooms, ranging from close-up magic to the larger Illusions on their main stage.They have a great staff, ranging from the valets to the performers and you always feel a welcome, hospitable vibe. The food is a little pricy for what you get, but I've always enjoyed my meal when dining there. The Magic Castle is a wonderful venue that you have to experience at least once in your life. But once you do, you'll want to visit it again and again. And you can, if you become a member, or know someone who already is.",5 star rating

1492,3/8/2015,"The Magic Castle is my favorite! Recently we had dinner there and it was AMAZING! Probably around $40 a plate, but some of the best food I have had in a long time. I do want to say that of all the magicians I have seen Jimmy H. stands out as one of my favorite. He was funny, great to watch, combined music with his act perfectly, and was truly magical! Can't wait to go back and see him again! Another fun part of the magic castle is sometimes it is nice to just enjoy a close show at one of the card tables around the castle instead of seeing the main shows. It is more relaxing and fun to be apart of the show!A tip for first timers who want to go back: Photo's are not aloud in the castle, so there is a professional photographer that goes around all night. Find him/ her and get a photo, pay for it ($20), and it comes with 8 guest passes to come back again! That is how I keep coming back :)",5 star rating
1493,11/24/2013,"The service here was terrible. Like, I've had better service at Burger King and Motel 6.To be fair, our party was at times a bit of a headache. Half of our group was late to dinner because of an innocent  miscommunication, and inside the castle some people in our group would stand in lines and tell others of us to basically jump ahead of everyone, which is neither allowed nor appreciated (and which we didn't do). However, the way the situations were handled was messy and left a sour taste in our mouths. For example, our friends would call out to us to come jump in line and although we didn't intend to at all, the person managing the line would directly address us, the party being urged to jump, and basically scold us, ""YOU are not getting into this show. THEY can go in, but YOU cannot."" Yeah, I didn't expect to, ahole. There are better ways to respond, like by addressing the people urging us to cut and telling them, in a non-combative tone (I mean, these are customers who've been drinking.. Have some sense), ""My apologies, but we actually don't allow for people to hold spots. We understand it's an inconvenience, but we have to be fair to everyone else in line."" I have to come up with responses like this all the time. It's really not hard to NOT frustrate people.I had never been to Magic Castle, but it definitely did not live up to the hype. From dinner to the main events, we were treated horribly, whether anybody in our group was acting out or not. Even when you have customers who cause a bit of a ruckus, though (and by ruckus, I literally mean there were a couple people who were just really happy to be there, to be --loudly--celebrating our friend's birthday, and who may have not understood all the rules completely... They weren't starting trouble), there is a trick to handling them. That's one trick Magic Castle definitely has not mastered.For dinner, please note that everyone in your party is required to order an entree. If you reserve a table for 6 and one person doesn't show, you're going to be paying $25 to cover their chair. The portion sizes are itty bitty and outrageously priced. All of this is to be expected, I suppose, but please just be aware. If you come expecting anything else, the management won't let you down gently (our waitress was nice enough, but her supervisor with the big glasses was annoyingly pushy about everything).We saw a few of the shows, including a one on one that was really great and a smaller show at the beginning with a couple of guys doing various tricks that was fantastic. After a terrible experience at dinner, we were really thinking things were going to improve at this point, but alas the staff's short patience wore down our own as it continued to rear its head again and again, so a couple of us from our party just decided to skip out on the rest of the evening and go back to the hotel.(As an aside to animal lovers, another thing that soured me a bit to the experience was the use of live animals in one of the shows. This basically just added piss to a burning pile of manure, though).The best actual staff (excluding some of the performers, from whom the rest of the staff could learn a thing or two) was probably the shuttle drivers. They were so friendly. The guy who greeted us at the hotel upon our arrival, Nick, was also fantastic, although the rest of the staff treated us like we were worthless.In short, it would take a whole lot of freaky deaky magic tricks to get me to happily come back to this place.",2 star rating

1495,1/26/2015,"I was fortunate enough to have received an invitation to the magic castle, via a magician. I made reservations for dinner, for our party of 6, on a Saturday night, at 8 PM. I wish I was told of the line outside, just to get in. Standing and waiting, for 40 minutes, was annoying. Luckily, it wasn't a cold evening out. The inside is decorated gorgeously. They allow no photos. There are many different rooms, on all 3 levels, that house ""first come, first serve"" 20-minute, magic acts. I also wish I had known this was included with your admission, as I'd have arrived much earlier. There were many bars in the castle, and it didn't take long for service. I loved their Moscato! Dinner was phenomenal and worth the hefty price tag! I ordered legs of lamb and enjoyed a crab bisque soup, appetizer. A slight delay for waters to come and was surprised a bread basket wasn't offered.The magicians are better than most magic shows, in the area. I would certainly return! With our admission, dinner was mandatory. Some did not require a dinner purchase, so I assume they were invited by members.",4 star rating
1496,3/26/2012,"For the first couple hours we were there I was about to give the Magic Castle a two star review.  We didn't see any magic until we got into the main show!  I thought there were supposed to be magicians hanging out everywhere?  I thought they would come to our table during dinner or something but we only saw one guy near the main theater.  Maybe since it was a Sunday...  When we got out of dinner, both of the small rooms were full so we just stood around for 45 minutes waiting for the main show.  Dinner was mandatory if you wanted main show tickets, but I think we probably could have skipped it if we wanted.  The food, as others have said, is mediocre.  Salmon was $26 and a glass of chardonnay was $9.After we finally started getting into shows I had a much better time.  Most of the shows were comedy magic which I thought was lame, but I was still impressed with the tricks.  My puny brain can never figure out illusions so the word of the evening was ""WHAAATTTTT!!"".  We ended up seeing almost all of the official performers but I can't imagine how one would be able to see all the shows on a Friday or Saturday since we still had to wait a long time for each one.  Toward the end most people were gone so we were able to see the Closeup Gallery show twice... Chef Anton was my favorite performer of the night.  In the lounge, Irma the ghost piano didn't know any Pearl Jam, but she played some Journey for me.  Finally at the very end we saw a magician sitting at the bar and he did a couple of last minute card tricks that blew my mind (I think the wine helped).  All in all I would definitely return, and I would probably try to skip dinner and wait in line for the last main show, which had plenty of open seats.  Oh, and my bf forgot his tie but they lent him one in exchange for his ID.  I heard they also lend coats if you bring one that doesn't fit the dress code.",4 star rating
1497,10/4/2013,"Please note this is just a review of the restaurant. The Magic Castle experience itself was fantastic.This was the most underwhelming and overpriced dinner I've had to date in my two year tenure in LA. Our tour leader was nice enough to snag us a last minute reservation after our tour of the castle, but the niceties stopped there. We were a party of 4, ordered a bottle of wine, the truffle fries (which were pretty damn good), the chicken, two salmon, and the ravioli. Aside from the ravioli, everything was bad. The chicken tasted nice, but was horrifically dry, the lentils were undercooked and hard, and the salmon was tasteless. Our used bread and butter plates remained stacked and uncleared for the entirety of dinner. Once our food was delivered, our server disappeared (accidental magic pun) and never came back to check on us or ask how the food was.Another server constantly bumped my chair without acknowledgement as he tried to squeeze past me and there was a photographer snapping away with an obnoxious flash at the table behind us. I am a server myself, and am usually quite understanding and laid back, but this was pretty bad. I can deal with mediocre food and awesome service--or vice versa. Mediocre food and shitty service? Not cool. Especially when dropping $60 a person. At least my water glass was always full.",2 star rating

1499,8/19/2011,"You DEFINITELY need to come here once in your life.I was lucky enough to know someone who knew someone who knew someone who's a member of the castle. There were around 20 people in our party so every show that we watched was with people in our group.My friends and I arrived around 5:30PM on a Sunday night. Let's just say when you first walk into the castle, you enter through a secret entrance behind a book shelf...!I was able to catch 4 shows, which were all very good. I'm sad I don't remember any of their names...........One of the magicians also gave me his pack of Magic Cards.... I was so happy T_T.The food there was amazing1) CHEESE BREAD- SO GOOD. I had probably 4 pieces...2) CINNAMON ROLL- SO GOOD. I had 2...3) CAESAR SALAD- like any other salad4) LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE- wow, I think anything that has lobster or mac n cheese is a winner5) PENNE WITH ROCK SHRIMP- this was pretty good too, there was a funny reference to being asian because there were 2 little bread sticks that looked like chopsticks.Overall, the food was really good but pricey of course....I thought my visit to the Magic Castle was only going to be a 2 hour visit but it turned out to be 7 hours. I felt like I was in the Hogwarts, making references to Happy Potter here and there, and everywhere. HAHA I even found his glasses in a showcase next to our dining room.I would tell you everything that I've experienced there but you should go see for yourself. I wouldn't want to spoil the fun.",5 star rating
1500,10/5/2011,"Meh. I'm not really into magic and I never seen Harry Potter. I DO live in LA and always drive by the Castle on my way to the 101, I figured It's something I should check out at least once in my life, right? Wrong. Unless you're a little kid or a cheesy old guy, this place will not be for you.Okay, I'm all for having a good time but dropping 25 bucks at the door just to get in to mingle with a bunch of old (I mean old) dudes, Isn't my cup of tea. Drinking didn't help much, the place has got all these little bars all over the castle so if that's you're thing, go for it. I personally didn't feel like dropping down any more money after my ridiculously over priced and cafeteria-style dinner entree. The cheapest thing on the menu was a plate of Uncle Ben's brown rice and some defrosted vegetables. That was 20 bucks. Oh, but I DID get a soggy house salad and a cherry tomato with it! (... oh yay) Other dishes at the table were hit or miss.Our server was so ""whatever"". I thought, oh, how cool! Is the waiter going to do a little magic at the table!? Nope, nothing like that, he was your standard pretentious Hollywood waiter. Insisting on appetizers and drinks multiple times to pad the bill. Oy. The only trick he did was making my good mood disappear. He was over it - and frankly so was everyone at our table. The food was terrible and the show we saw was not really ""magical"". It was more of a vaudeville act, really hokey and ""comical"". Wikipedia says this place has been around since 1963, I think these magic tricks have been the same since 1963. One guy juggled a bowling ball, an Altoid and a straw. From reading other reviews, this seems to be this one guy's big claim to fame. It was cool, but at the same time... meh.Saw the one show and that was frankly enough. It was almost painful being here. My dear friend, who's 26th birthday it was, was really having a good time - so we all stuck through it, for the kiddos sake. You really gotta be into this stuff. It's like, you know better than to take your macho-man, trucker boyfriend to see Glee the Musical. Just the same, the magic castle is for some, but not everyone.Hindsight:Total paid that night, Cover charge, plus dinner, the 20 min show and ONE drink = $66 bucks. Not a cheap evening for the quality received.Wish I would have known about emailing the magician's to get on a ""list"" - would have saved me the $25 cover. Also, would have DEFINATELY passed up dinner instead and just seen the shows. Actually, would have paid someone $10 bucks on Highland and Hollywood to do some magic on the street. Probably would have been more exciting.I give them 2 stars for somehow magically staying in business for nearly 40 years.",2 star rating

1509,4/8/2017,"We had to say, ""open sesame"" to a small owl statue on a bookshelf in the lobby revealing a secret passage way to the first of 6 bars situated throughout the mansion. We ate dinner in a room adorned with vintage magician posters meticulously placed amongst the antiquated mahogany walls. Dinner was delicious. I had the Scottish Salmon for $39 and my date had the 6oz filet Mignon for $37. After dinner we wandered through secret corridors and staircases stumbling into small rooms and parlors where magicians were already dazzling people with the most amazing close-up tricks and illusions. There's a grand piano playing ghost named Irma that will take your whispered song requests and tons of gags strewn throughout the mansion that you can explore on your own like an old phone booth that tells your future. The main show was tremendous. Full of top notch head scratching magic I'll never forget. A strict dress code of suit and ties and dresses bolsters the secret society atmosphere and exclusivity. The only way to attend the Magic Castle is to know a Magician or a member who extends you a formal invitation. So much fun! You have to go at least once.",5 star rating
1510,12/10/2017,"Very very disappointed.  I got invited, and was excited.  You have to book months in advance, which is understandable.  But waiting months and months, so much hype, I guess i had high expectations.  Drinks are an absolute rip off.  Small cups filled with ice, with a price tag.  Food was unsatisfactory !  Lobster tail was rubber, i couldn't cut it nor chew it.  Shrimp cocktail is 4 pieces of shrimp for $20!  And the special for the day, the tomahawk Milton style was so horrible, my husband was grossed out, and didn't even want to eat it.  It ended up being  $91 (wish we knew the price prior to ordering, but it's a special so it's not on the menu!!) luckily we had  baked potatoes which avoided us from leaving the table still hungry.   It wasn't bad enough that the food sucked, the magic show was a ventriloquist!  Where is the magic in that??  He sang with a puppet and it was supposed to be magic?  This was in the palace showroom, and was a 40 min show, so knowing there are other shows, we said ok, we can catch another show to see some magic (since that's what we came for right?).  Well, without making any other stops, we rushed to find another show.  All full. No other shows.  Too bad for us we didn't know we had to walk out of a show early in order to catch another one.  All other shows had already started and were full.    I tried to complain to someone, and she basically said too bad, it's full.  So, was i supposed to rudely walk out during the ventriloquist show in order to catch another show?  Sorry, as much as I didn't enjoy it, I'm just not rude like that to have walked out of the first show mid-way. I swear Irma was the highlight of the night.   Our party ended up spending over a grand that evening and left there with only being impressed with a piano being played by a ghost. Even that's not considered magic, thats more like haunted, or more like google/Shazam operated. And, not to mention she won't even play unless she's being tipped.   After we left, we even realized that tip was included in our dinner and we put additional tip, and waiter didn't tell us it was going to be included. He got a very excessive tip that night. Tip was included and we paid an additional tip, and he didn't even say anything to us and we noticed it after we left. Overpriced food, entrance and valet fees, and all those tips we had to pay, for a magic show which wasn't even impressive (very boring show).   At least after spending all that money, i wanted to leave the place with some sort of astonishment, but it was like throwing money away.  So... save your money, don't let this place rob you.",2 star rating

I went there having no idea what to expect, but I ended up having a wonderful time.From the moment we walked in, we were dazzled. After being graciously welcomed and whispering the magic words enter the castle, we walked in the main area and took a seat by the bar. The atmosphere is amazing. Everyone looks so classy and well-dressed that it feels as though you really are dining in a castle. The interior is decorated in an old-Hollywood-glam-meets-magic-show deco. The drinks were much cheaper than we expected to pay for such a fancy place ($22 for two), which isn't bad when you consider how much you pay for drinks at clubs, etc. The drinks were stiff, and kept me at a pleasantly light buzz through dinner. Food: After reading so many Yelp reviews critical of the food here, I came in with low expectations. That probably worked in my favor because I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of our meal. My boyfriend's prime rib was excellent (and huge), and my NY steak was quite good too! Both the side mashed potatoes and salad that the entrees came with were pretty decent, though nothing special. Tip: The side salad comes DRENCHED in dressing, so if you're not a fan of that, make sure to ask for it on the side.The Magic: The main magic show is BEST magic show I've ever seen! Fun & engaging, but realize that if you sit in the front row, you're begging to get picked on by the performers. Go along with it, it's fun! We only saw a couple other smaller acts.

1518,9/28/2011,"I had a really good time here two months ago on a weeknight (when I would rate it 5 stars), but after this past Sunday, I'm giving it 2.5 stars (based on my two experiences.)  I am critiquing the latter experience.We came here for my mom's birthday last Sunday night.  When we got there (around 5:15pm) I went up to the dining area and asked the host about birthdays and what they do.  He asked for my mom's name and said they give free dessert (ice cream) and sing to her.  He said it as if it was really special treatment. Well, half an hour later, when it was our turn to eat, the host didn't even remember me, but we were seated after he blatantly made it obvious that he was giving another party extra special treatment (he apparently gave them the best seats in the house, which I have no idea where or what that is since he barely looked at me.)  We ordered the calamari and Portobello fries for appetizers since two months ago when we went there those were among the best I've ever tried (but it was also on a Tuesday night)  On a Sunday night like this one, perhaps the kitchen was more worried about the quantity of food rather than the quality because this time the two dishes didn't taste nearly as good as the time before.  This made me worry about our main course.  I ordered the lamb.  I asked for it to be medium rare, just how I like it, and when it came to me it was medium-rare, so how could it be dry and tasteless?  I was appalled.  I tried dipping it in four different sauces on the table (from other people's prime rib and even my salad dressing!) to try to make it taste good.  I can cook a much better lamb at home and I'm not a professional over-priced top-notch restaurant.  To make the dining experience even worse was they brought the check without even bringing my mom her ""special occasion ice cream.""  I was fuming!  My boyfriend had to get up and remind them, and after about 10 minutes they came out with a tiny mound of vanilla ice cream.  By the time my mom got it, the energy was lost because we were checking the time to make it to our 8:30pm show (which we nearly missed!)  I'm sure by this time, you can see my frustration.  I mean, I've been to other establishments (like Morton's, Roy's, and Musashi to name a few) and they treat us extremely well; they treat the birthday person like royalty.  They go above and beyond, giving you a free dessert of your choice, writing up a special menu just for the birthday girl/boy, and taking a group picture and printing it out for you to remember your good dining experience.  It's those little touches that sell me. For an establishment like Magic Castle (where you're not allowed to take pictures) you'd expect they'd give you special treatment especially because it's such an exclusive club and costs $20 just to get in.  But this place takes your money and runs.  The best thing about our meal was the company, which I provided the Magic Castle.  They should be paying me back for bringing in 8 people!  As for the shows, they were mediocre at best.  More a comedy variety show than a magic show.  I doubt these are the best magicians in the world.  And what made it even worse was the number of seats to the number of people.  More than half the people that wanted to see the show couldn't because they seemed overbooked.  I see people comparing this to Disneyland.  Yes, it has the potential to be a fun place, but the only comparison I felt was throwing money away to wait in long lines and be treated like cattle.  What are people paying the $20 cover for if they can't take a seat and see magic?  ""Pay us $20 to come in and pay us $20 more for a single drink.""  I won't be coming back for a while unless I can go with one of my friends who can get us in for free.  And I wouldn't recommend the dining to anyone, not even my enemies.  In short, if this is all you read of my review:  Eat before you get there because the only magic you see is your money disappearing!",2 star rating
1519,5/16/2015,My coworker landed tickets to the magic castle and decided to invite me along with a group of five other people. WARNING: The magic castle is very strict about dress code. Men must wear leather dress shoes / loafers. I had a high end leather pair of sneakers on & they wouldn't let me in. Luckily they had some back up pairs of dress shoes in the office & they loaded me a pair for the night. If they didn't do that i would of had to go home which would of ruined my night. Another guest in our crew didn't have dress pants on and was not allowed in. Besides that the magic was fantastic. We saw an illusionist named Jonathan Pendragon who was very entertaining. The only downside about my experience at the Castle was that they require you to have dinner. I found all the meals over priced and the quality did not match the price. I  ordered lamb chops which were kind of tasty but not that much meat & definitely not worth $45.,4 star rating
1520,10/12/2015,"My initial experience was pretty pleasant but awkward I have to say. We went for brunch and everything was pretty good. The weird part was when we were paying for the $20 ($21 with card) picture so we can get passed for next time, the photographer and the waiter were talking about how the photographer surpassed his commission and how much money he's going to make (essentially from suckers like us). Just plain unprofessional. We get it, you're going to make bank.So come time to me making a reservation for my next visit. I called and a worker named Makayla answered. I asked what dates for dinner are available for Saturday evening and she said all dinner dates are booked up till next year but thru out a couple of dates that are still available for this year to me anyways. But didn't she just say there weren't any left?? Just from talking to her on the phone, she had a very entitled and rather bitchy tone to her, which I didn't understand. I am simply trying to make a reservation. Well I told her I had to call her back so I can confirm with everyone on the date which didn't work out anyways. I called back later hoping I wouldn't get her again, but I wasn't lucky enough. She answers the phone and I ask her again what dates are available for Sunday and some other simple questions. Again she was rude. It seemed like I was interfering with her life by asking her to do her job. She simply cannot grasp the fact that I am trying to make a reservation and her condescending tone does not help, to the point where I've had enough and I asked to speak to a manger and she said there's no manager (okay..). I ask to speak to anyone else but her and she said there's a new guy (okay again..). I tell her that she's not helping and is being rude and unfriendly. She says that she doesn't think she is. At this point, the right thing to do at least on her end is to hand me over to the ""new guy"" and let me make my reservations and not try to argue with me. But no it was just to hard for her to do her job. I guess she overheard me calling her a ""f*cking bitch"" (which I totally stand behind on) when I was supposedly put on hold and she flipped. Well the truth hurts especially to someone that's so oblivious to it. I hope this women gets help in whichever way she can, so that she can be a happier person and do her JOB.",1 star rating
1521,9/23/2011,I love the magic castle. A friend of ours is a magician who performs here and we went one night to have dinner and see Stan do his show. It was awesome!!!! I have no clue how he pulls it off!I have been to one of his shows elsewhere also and seen him really up close and it is just bamboozling!!! I cannot tell how he does it! I want to know :) Which is part of the awesomeness of the Magic Castle.Here you get a real old school feel in the castle. Love it all.Dinner was decent also :),5 star rating
1522,4/12/2015,I've been twice now and I just love this establishment! There's magic around every turn and it's all top notch. Even just waking around you're bound to run into a friendly magician who has something to show you whether it be a trick or history of the castle.The bar is also fantastic. The drinks are a twist on classics and the bartenders take care to get it just right.Next I want to try a seance!!!,5 star rating
1523,2/16/2013,I really love this place. I was invited to come here a few years ago. They had the most unbeliavable magic shows I've ever seen. And I've been too many magic shows. This is NOT your simple cutting a girl in half trick! It's amazing. The best part is that they have a dress code and everyone is dress to elegantly. I am so happy I came here. I wish I had a membership to come more often. If you ever get an invitation GO! Or if you have enough money to get a membership get it :),5 star rating

1525,1/30/2012,"Just the fact that it was an ""exclusive club"" made it seem that much more surreal. Here's what I thought of the place:1. Dinner: large portions, decent (above average taste), higher end pricing. I got the roasted chicken and my companion ordered the prime rib. The chicken was cooked very well however our only complaint was that the food was a bit cold when it came out (and it came out so fast that we both think that it was pre-made before we ordered it). I wasn't at all impressed with the appetizers - and found that the ravioli was too sweet and way too creamy. Mainly only ate dinner because you are required to eat dinner to see the palace show. 2. Palace Show: very comical with lots of illusionist acts. The house comedian was very entertaining especially with his tricks with his dove Bob. The other act however was somewhat mediocre just because in this day and age, levitation acts can be done with a few pieces of wireless technology. But he did have a few surprises up his sleeve that left me wondering.. 3. Close-ups: were definitely my favorite. Most magicians work with cards and coins so some tricks may seem redundant but I definitely got a kick out of Nathan, the young magician who apprenticed there at the age of ~8. (Something about him reminded me of Jack Black -- or more accurately, the panda in Kung-fu Panda). :P4. Drinks/Cocktails: would not recommend coming to this place if you wanted well-made drinks. Grimlet was way too sour and even just the cranberry juice seemed watered down. All in all, this is a place to go to have a unique experience with the magical/mystical world, not with the culinary arts.",4 star rating
1526,9/25/2016,"Is not the first time i've been there.. If you go to that place is because you want to have a great time and great service that's why you pay the price. Right? The security guard at the door was very unfriendly. The magicians were great but one of them was very rude with one of our guest. My friend asked to participate 2 times in his show and the magician said to him:  ""I don't know what kind of drug you are using but for sure is not the same I use""!!!.. WOW!!!! How embarrassed. Magical service the waiters didn't appear my husband had to go to the bar to get our drinks. Also they don't allow to take pictures, fine. At the beginning of our diner we asked for the photographer to take a picture while we were eating at the table and he finally showed up at the end of our diner when we were having coffee.. He took a picture and I said to my husband it was to dark, the photographer look at me and said I don't care if you don't buy it.. WOW!!!! He was so rude!!!! My husband told him he was being rather rude and then the photographer called the security and the security said that they make the rules and if we are not happy we are welcome to leave!!! WOW!!!! Really??? Do they have training?? Who is in charge to train this people?? Is this the way they are train to treat their guests??",2 star rating
1527,7/21/2014,"Awesome night! Came here with the Magician himself for a party of 10, so the entrance fee was waived. For dinner, I had the Beef Wellington and Magic Moment cocktail, and both were great. I also tried the Ice Rickeye, which didn't really have much rum in it, but still tasted very good. The best show of the night was definitely Mac King's. This was such an amazing show, it totally beat the rest of the night's! Would definitely come back again. The experience was awesome.",5 star rating

I suggest you guys get an invite here when he's in town and watch his show. You guys can thank me later.They always have different magicians so it's either a hit or miss I've heard.

1529,4/7/2014,"A magical night ... the old architecture .. the dark woods, the maze of rooms to find the Close-Up Magician performances... the ambience was so special.5 stars for the food, service and performances!  In my party of 6, half had never been there.  I had the invite and was happy to see my ""Magician"" perform and say hi! We had a 6pm seating ... I had the portobello/porcinio ravioli with the seasonal veggies side dish.  Tasty and filling.  My boyfriend and I shared the arugula & pear salad.  Eveyone enjoyed their meals ... salmon, sea bass, filet mignon.  We shared 3 desserts  - coconut sorbet, mint chip ice cream and a chocolate cake.  Creamy, tasty and wow!We had a great server ... very attentive and pleasant.Loved the dress code!  I got to wear one of my cocktail dresses and a great people watching venue!At 8:15 - the main stage - 2 performances ..my friends were chosen for the card trick.. and one ended up with a newspaper with his name on it!  How did the magician do that?  I have always enjoyed ""the magic"" .. wondering .. ""How did they do that"" ... but don't really want to know.  Love the Illusions!So all in all... if you have a chance to be ""invited"" ... $10 for valet parking, $30 per person entry on Sunday,  $30-$40 per entree + drinks, Entertainment - priceless!Enjoy a special evening!",5 star rating
1530,6/15/2016,"I was invited by a magician, who is a family friend, for my birthday. Upon arrival, we entered by saying the secret word to the owl. We then proceeded to a small room where magic was being performed. There were some great card and coin tricks! The drinks at the bar were overpriced and small. The biggest disappointment of the night was dinner. We had a party of six. I am used to dining at very nice restaurants like Maestros, Ruths Chris, BOA, etc. Two people in our party ordered the filet. This was one of the blandest steaks we've ever tasted. The macaroni and cheese literally had no taste to it, we felt like we were served plain noodles. I personally ordered the scallops, delicious but for $40 I would expect more than four. The sweet potatoes served with them was about two tablespoons, if that. When the bill came, it was over $500. For the price I would expect the same quality as the aforementioned restaurants.After dinner, we went and saw the main show. This was a great show. Overall, it was a fun experience. Next time, we will skip dinner.",3 star rating

Heaven help you if you show up in pants with rivets or a jacket with visible zippers. DOESN'T MATTER IF ITS PRADA. God will not have mercy on you if you're a woman in slacks and a blouse. You will be told to go home and get a jacket. Dress like you're going to your office job in the i.t. department. Don't try to look cool or different. Don't ask questions.

1535,7/19/2011,"Hocus Pocus! *POOF*What the bananas? How did? Huh? ...AMAZING! Show me more!That pretty much captured my entire night at the Magic Castle.  When I first arrived, it smelled like a mix of Disneyland and Harry Pottuh heaven.  Awesome.  It couldn't start any better when you can whisper ""open sesame"" at the reception area and the door automatically opens, leading you into the bar.  The castle was very dark and big, yet intimate.  There is always something to look at wherever you walk.I came here for a friend's bday and got an extended invite where we each had to pay $25 on a Saturday night along with the $8 valet.  We had dinner reservations at 8pm and arrived earlier than anticipated due to the overhyped Carmageddon.  So we were able to sit at the bar and a worker gave us some history on the castle and even showed a few magic card tricks.  Dinner was just as expected, overpriced for decent food. I give it 3 stars.  Since they have a minimum entrée order per person, the waiter was nice enough to let me order an appetizer and a side together instead which adds up to an entrée.  I got the Lobster mac & cheese ($15) and Portobello fries ($9).  The Portobello fries came out freshly fried with a great spicy Ponzu dipping sauce.  The Lobster mac & cheese was ok, a few pieces of lobster bits here and there but nothing crazy.  At least each person gets a ticket to the main show afterwards.5+ stars for the magic!  I was able to see two shows and they were both very entertaining.  They keep it spicy by updating different magicians and performers weekly.  Most of the time they have audience participation just to further prove how magical their tricks are. No, there were no Accio Harry Potter tricks...although that would be sweet.  I laughed, I scratched my head, I admired.  I'm pretty sure my eyes were going to go bonkers from focusing so hard.  I still left confused, shocked, and in awe.  The magic itself is better left off without much description....just go and experience it with innocence and an open mind.  You will be blown away.  Tip: come earlier for dinner so you have more time to squeeze in more shows. Also, no photos (boo) and cell phones allowed. Sweet balls of fire, I can finally cross Magic Castle off my bucket list!",5 star rating
1536,2/1/2015,Step into a world of its own and be prepared to dress the part! Entertained all night by bizarre acts and magical performances. I must say this is one of the most intriguing places in Los Angeles. The staff is very nice and the food was tasty.,5 star rating
1537,9/26/2011,"The Magic Castle to adults is like Disneyland to children, both providing magical experience to anyone who attends.  I am too fortunate to have a friend who is not only a member of The Magical Castle, but also a performer! First, let me review the place.  It is a mansion!  As you enter the gateway, you drive through a bite of a winding road to reach the front entrance of the castle.  At the entrance, there is a valet that will open the door for you and park your car. The place seems very small when you first step it, but that is only an illusion!  After giving your name to the hostess, she will tell you to stand in front of a bookcase that magically opens for you to enter!!!I remember there being 3 floors, and every single floor has a bar. I had appetizers, complimentary of my performer friend, so the food just tastes even better.  Walking around the castle does not give me a sense of actually being in a castle or mansion, however.  Nevertheless, there were a few magicians sitting at hallways performing tarot cards and small card tricks.  Although these magicians are great at what they do, they don't stand a chance with the ones who are performing in their own room.  Each each, there are a different sets of performers, and I was lucky to attend twice!On my first time, I was lucky to see a magician who is also an actor and was on House MD!  (He was the magician who got sick).My favorite performer, however, has to be Tam Vo.  I am not just saying this because he is my friend, but because he is truly talented!   It is amazing to see such a transformation from a friend to a magician.  The only sad thing here is that you can only attend if you're invited by a member, or are a member yourself.  However, if you get the chance to come here, I say take that chance and expect magic to happen!",5 star rating
1538,6/8/2014,"the castle itself is very, very cool.  it is a very cool space with lots of history and a cool vibe.  the magic itself was meh.  i would call two out of the three shows as being bar mitzvah-level magic (the magic show i saw the following night at the el capitan theater before the showing of ""maleficent"" was actually more impressive).  one show with this mentalist was great.  food is required and so is a jacket and tie.  it is cool to have to dress up so it keeps out that vegas touristy element.  food is above average and certainly better than expected for a place like this.  i would call it ""wedding banquet"" quality.  it certainly was not bad at all, and service was actually very good.  definitely a place to visit but i guess this particular night the magic was just okay.  i suspect there are some great shows but not this night. still, it's worth a visit.",4 star rating

1540,1/3/2013,"It's definitely about the experience.Yes it's established that you need to have a guest pass/be a member and a reservation. The party in front of us was checking themselves in with the hostess but apparently was not on the guest list, however the hostess was kind enough to allow them in, putting them as guests under her name; so they're pretty strict about the whole guest pass thing I guess. I wouldn't recommend you going and hoping for the same scenario, or you can try!The place is a lot smaller than I anticipated. The dining table is tiny and the distance between tables is probably a little more than an arms-length. It's also really dark in the dining area, to the point where the older guests had difficulty reading their menus. As for the food, I got the lamb shank which wasn't really spectacular at all, for the price I think the prime rib or steak would have been a better choice, I base this judgement off of the reactions of the rest of my party regarding their food. The drinks are good? Seeing as how I spent my 21st birthday there I wouldn't know too much. I only know that they don't do mixed drinks. After finishing your dinner, they hand you your tickets to see shows at your table.There's different ones at different times and you can walk around the castle to whichever show you want. It seems rather crowded. I went on a Tuesday night and some shows were full to the point where they had to turn people away. The hallways are also rather small so you sort of have to squeeze through a sea of people. Like i said before, the place is a lot smaller than ""castle"" would suggest. The shows themselves were entertaining and charming, I'm not too particular about my magic shows so they were fine by my standard. Overall a good experience and a fun place to visit and say that you have been to. No cameras allowed, which is rather sad. I think the exclusivity aspect of this place adds to its reputation... I would say 3.5/5 for the whole thing but I'll round up.",4 star rating
1541,5/11/2015,"Mother's Day brunch was my first, long awaited visit to Magic Castle but definitely not my last. Valet parking is mandatory and convenient. Before being allowed in about 15 minutes before our reservation time, we snapped photos outside the step and repeat. Then we were invited in, paid for parking, and stepped through the secret entry to the incredible, fantasy building.I could have hung out in Irma's piano room (with bar) all day but had to go upstairs for buffet. The service was polite and speedy. Everyone in our group: vegetarians; omnivores; gluten-frees all found plenty of food to eat. Mostly everything was yummy, with few exceptions of some stale waffles and cinnamon buns. But it was the latest seating so perhaps earlier in the day is better. In fact, in the future I will make earlier reservations so I have more time to see magic shows! Because we had to book the last brunch seating, we only had time for the main stage show which was hugely entertaining, but not the close up magic which I understand is fantastic.

1546,7/3/2013,"I've been to the Magic Castle and in the past the experience has been overall pleasant but this time it was more than disappointing.  The magic of course was AMAZING but the dinner and dinner service was TERRIBLE.   My Dad, who was in from out of town, and had never been to the Castle so we went for his birthday.  I told them when I made the reservation and when I double checked with the hostess she said ""it's not noted but I will tell your server"".  Then when the server came over, we assumed she would wish him a happy birthday or mention that we were celebrating but she didn't.  I worked it into the conversation to which she replied ""oh happy birthday"" as if it was the first she was hearing of it! As we were finishing dinner she asked if we needed anything else and then dropped the check, so we thought maybe they don't do ""special occasions"" at the Castle but as we were walking downstairs a different waitress set a scoop of ice cream with a candle in it on another table and proceeded to sing with them! SO NOT COOL:(   The rest of the service was also sub par.  The waitress read us one of the specials when I made a substitution request instead of when we sat down, we had to ask twice for her to bring the bread that was on every other table and had to ask multiple times for drink refills. Then we were waiting in line for the close up magic and it was really hot.  (The castle was more crowded than I had ever seen it.) My dad started to take off his jacket to cool off for a minute.  The guy monitoring the line came over and VERY RUDELY told him to put his jacket back on because ""we have a dress code here"".  Give me a break!  We had been standing in line for 20 minutes, and he just wanted to cool off for a minute!  It wasn't like he was wearing a tank top, he still had a dress shirt and tie on.  Also, had the guy been polite about it, that would have been different.The other thing that was disappointing was the phone booth that has a cool illusion was completely broken!  Several of us when in and tried it and NOTHING happened.  I've seen it before and it's really cool.  They should have put an out of order sign on it or something but instead I had my mom go in and she came out unimpressed.  We realized it was broken so I told her what was supposed to happen.  I've had such pleasant experiences every other time I've been here but the combination of the poor dinner service, ignoring my Dad's birthday and the rude line attendant will make me think twice about ever giving the castle another dime:(   It's very disappointing because the magicians and the magic were wonderful, as always.",1 star rating

Of course, it was all just speculation, none of us are magicians. However, one of the workers (Brian) came up to us and started yelling at us for talking about the tricks. We were shocked.

1548,10/3/2011,"I've been to this place probably 6 or 8 times in the past 15 years. Let me start off by saying that the performers are all incredibly talented, and that I have always enjoyed the closeup magicians and shows in the main theater... That being said, this review is about the venue, bar and restaurant, not the performers. The beautiful castle (house) sits in the center of Hollywood, but seems isolated. Inside, the place seems a bit dated, dingy and a cheesy, with ""open sesame"" commands needed to move a wall to enter. There are quite a few little rooms with some of the best closeup magicians I've ever seen... As well as a small main theater with top notch magicians headlining and making suprise appearances. The restaurant and bar are very marginal and quite expensive. Even with an invite, you will have to pay admission, drink minimum and valet...

However, I thought the food was okay, I had the bone-in rib eye and it was not flavorful at all, even being aged for 21 days. My boyfriend had the prime rib and I thought it was decent, mash potato was really good. We added the lobster tail and it was delicious, cooked really well. Must have!!!

1550,6/13/2011,"I have to say. Before I say anything else. The MAGIC is fantastic. My two stars have nothing to do with the magicians, they will blow you away and they are all fantastic. With that said, you get ""invited"". Someone who is a magician there meets you and they ""invite"" you. They give you passes. Now they are hard to get, so you become very excited! You tell all your friends. ""I got passes to the magic castle!!!'"" Then you go, and your all dressed up, your excited. You valet your car...okay.. understandable. You walk in, and it's $20 each to get in. ""But I have passes!"" you say, ""Oh that just gets you in the front door."" They say. Then they ask when you will be eating. Because you see, everyone that goes MUST eat a meal. Okay fine, sit down, and look at the menu, the prices are ridiculous. between 30 and 50 bucks a plate, and of course you want to drink. ..So magically, $100's are gone, and you haven't seen any magic yet. On top of it all, it took us FOREVER to get our food. We just wanted to eat and go see some shows, but the service was sooo slow. We missed two shows while eating. And the food wasn't even that great, ESPECIALLY for the money. Now, it would have been forgivable and maybe a different story all together if they had magicians at your table or walking around, doing tricks while you ate, or, actually,  while you waited to eat. Then I'd understand. It wouldn't feel like they are just sucking the money out of you, it would be, and it should be, dinner and a magic show. I'm actually STUNNED that they DON'T do that. Then there was the bald guy. Apparently the M.C. in a way, or maybe the manager on the floor. Not sure, but he was pompous and rude. Although I did see him smiling and talking with some people, then I looked closer and those people had little buttons on, little magic pins. Which means they are ""part of the club"". So I suppose they get special treatment, the rest of us are just cattle to make them money. All in all, it was a disappointing experience. The Magic was fantastic however, and the place was very cool on the inside. I'll sum it up.~They make it appear hard to gain entry~That makes you really want to go~You search for someone, anyone that knows SOMEONE with passes~That's the true magic of the castle.~It ends up being more expensive to spend a night at the Magic Castle then a whole day in both Disneyland parks (Assuming you take your date there)~Staff is rude to guests~Food isn't worth the price~Magic is fantastic~The Magic Castle itself is very coolBasically, Everyone has to go at least once. It's an experience! I just don't want you to get your hopes too high. Read what I've wrote, and expect it. And with your expectations lower, maybe you will get a better experience I had and it will be more than what you expected. My expectations were way to high, and I left in dismay. I hope to save others from the same fate. Pre-game, and enjoy the magic",2 star rating

But calamari was good, chicken was good, steak was huge and cooked perfectly. Portobello fries were yummy.But you definitely should not eat dinner there. Just go early and go right to all the shows. We went on a Saturday night and it did not seem too crowded. People watching is one of the best parts of going.Overall I am happy i went. It was definitely an experience. But I'm happier that I did not have to pay a cover or pay for most of my drinks because then I don't know if I would have been happy about going.David Blaine all the way baby.",3 star rating
1552,4/20/2015,"The Magic Castle was amazing.  We were guests for SUnday brunch and had an amaxing time.The food was served buffet style and was great.  Crab Legs, shrimp, ahi poke, ravioli, chicken and waffles, tattertots, fresh fruit, salads, 2 meat carving stations, dessert selection of mini cakes, ice cream and more!  Plus bottomless Mimosas.The acts were amazing and very intimate. Make sure to be in line for the shows they do fill up.  The lounge areas were very cool and the decor is elaborate.  You can not take photos inside the castle.The gift shop has magnets, tshirts, pins, cards, wands and more. Kate , the hostess for the day was amazing and fun, she took care of everyone.  We saw 4 shows, 2u pclose and 2 regular.  David and James in the upclose shows were amazing!!",5 star rating
1553,4/3/2012,"""Wait....It's an ACTUAL CASTLE!?""A quote my friends won't let me soon forget. When we arrived at this place I was a little weary of going to a magician's club because I felt like at my age, magic would be something that wouldn't be too impressive. I'm glad I was dead wrong.First of all this place is exclusive and you must be a member or receive an invite from a magician to attend. Its very upscale and formal age 21+ place. Suit jackets and ties are required. I really enjoyed the ""swanky"" atmosphere of the place. It felt very sophisticated and fun at the same time.The shows were absolutely incredible. They use random audience members in almost ALL of their tricks, even I was chosen once, to drive the magic point home. The whole time I couldn't figure out even how they begin to do these things, making me really believe in the magic, which is the whole point. The food was pricey, between $25-45 per entree, although it was well worth the price. I had the Penne with Rock Shrimp and it was just amazing. The sauce was so creamy and perfect and the shrimp was cut up into small pieces, making it easy to eat with the penne.A great place to visit.",4 star rating
1554,2/26/2013,"It was okay.  Definitely a ""bucket list"" thing to do.  However the first and last time I went (August 2012) it was teen week.  I went with a group and was not aware we were not going to see seasoned performers.  How is it that we ended up paying the same rate is beyond me.  So we overpaid.  I'm sure a different time will produce a different experience.Food was excellent.",3 star rating
1555,7/10/2011,"Pretty pricey but a cool place to experience at least once in your life. $20 cover per person if you don't come with a member, minimum one entree per person for dinner ($20-60), drinks (pushed HEAVILY at every opportunity by the waitresses), and valet.The dress code is STRICTLY ENFORCED - Don't think you can wear jeans and get away with it! Everyone is dressed fabulously, men HAVE to wear dress slacks, dress shoes, a dress shirt and a tie with a blazer but you can get a ""house blazer and tie"" from the check-in area if you come without. Women can get away with a pretty dress and heels or flats.We picked up a schedule and planned out which shows we wanted to go to and when in order to maximize our magic experience. Shows start on time and the doors are closed so no stragglers can interrupt, make sure you line up for a show that you really want to see 15-30 minutes ahead of time.We saw Jamy Ian Swiss perform in the Close-Up Gallery at 7:30pm and he was awesome! Funny and talented, he performed a number of card tricks with extremely witty banter the entire time. Our dinner seating was at 8pm so we met our favorite married couple at a table for our double date dinner. The boy ordered the lobster mac n cheese as a starter (which I warned him against since Yelp reviews on it were poor) and the regular size cut of prime rib as an entree. It was huge and pretty good.The menu states ONE ENTREE MINIMUM PER PERSON but I asked if I could order 2 appetizers which would total more than the cheapest entree and the waiter let me slide. I ordered the sweet corn ravioli and onion rings, both of which were awesome.The lobster mac n cheese SUCKED. It was dry, flavorless, and we couldn't find any lobster in it no matter how hard we tried. Perhaps someone made it ""magically disappear"" from the kitchen to our table - SUCH a disappointment, AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! It sounds delicious but it looks and tastes terrible.We spent a little too long at dinner and missed a show I wanted to see with Oscar Munoz. If anyone else saw it, how was it??We wandered around the castle for a bit and went into the ""Palace of Mystery"" for the main show. We each received a ticket from dinner which allowed us to bypass the line and be seated early. Jason Andrews performed classic, sophisticated, elegant magic (birds and scarves, no talking, all to music) and Chipper Lowell was a surprising, hilarious, super entertaining and AWESOME magician who I initially thought was just the host. We were laughing non-stop and he's definitely one of the best magicians/comedians I've ever seen in my life!Our favorite married couple had to leave to drive back to West Covina after the main act but the boy and I stayed to see Dana Daniels and his bird in the Parlour of Prestidigitation (kinda boring act until he picked out a Japanese tourist as a volunteer for the last trick which ended up being funny and awesome, in part because of the cute and slightly flustered Japanese tourist) and Dennis Kyriakos in the Close-Up Gallery at the end of the night (cool but kinda similar to Jamy Ian Swiss's performance - I think he was kinda put off by several super annoying girls in the audience who tried to make their own jokes, all's well that ends well though).The food was overpriced and average at best but the magic was great! I've been here before and the magic is hit or miss depending on which night you go on. Definitely worth checking out at least once if you live in LA!",3 star rating
1556,1/7/2012,"As a child, I've passed by this place always wondering who lives there and how cool it must be to own a house in the middle of hollywood. Fast forward years later and I came to slowly learn about the Magic Castle. I've been here a handful of times and yet each and every time is like coming for the first time...1) A work holiday event on a Friday during the day. This was cool since we got the entire place to ourselves so we were free to roam around.2) The boyfriend knew a magician performing at the Magic Castle who gave him 4 passes for a night. Watching him perform in the main showroom was awesome.3) A friend celebrated his birthday and has a friend who is a member of the Magic Castle. A nice perk is the invited group of people didn't have to pay any cover to get in.There is a strict dress code: females to wear dressy/cocktail attire and men must wear jackets. My forgetful boyfriend didn't bring a jacket and had to borrow a sports jacket from the Magic Castle. I've eaten dinner here for a friend's birthday and while it was totally cool that we had a private room to ourselves, the food was just average.  Depending on the magicians you can have a very entertaining/magical/funny show or you can have a mediocre one. Scattered throughout the castle are other mini-shows so if you get there early enough and really plan out a schedule, you can possible watch all that the Magic Castle has to offer OR you can do what me and my boyfriend like to do the past 2 times we've been here...post up by the bar nearest the large showroom for the big magician shows. You can sit there and order food there or just drinks.  Drinks at the Magic Castle pack a heavy punch and so we beeline it for this particular bar since its rarely crowded, unless its close to seating time for the main magic show.A unique good time in the heart of Hollywood.",4 star rating

I can't judge the food much, we only had appetizers and those were fine. The drinks were poured with heavy hand and were delicious.

1561,1/21/2008,"Wow...88 reviews already.  Okay, here goes another one.  Magic Castle is definitely something different...definitely a date place...definitely a special occasion place...definitely pricey...definitely worth it.  While waiting in line for one of the shows, a Magician from England told us there was nothing like the Magic Castle anywhere in the world.  There's a lot of history here.  The inside of the castle is dark and huge, yet cozy.  Everywhere you walk there is something to look at, even in the restrooms.  There is a bar on each of the three levels.  The thing I liked most is each of the three show rooms ranged in size from 21-100...small enough to feel the energy of each trick.    A tip: start waiting in line at least 30 minutes before each show's start time because every show gathers a large crowd.  Get your money's worth and try to view each show.  Sit in the front row and you will most likely get picked on.  (I was two for two in the front row.)      There are also little tables spread out throughout the castle for Magicians not a part of the line-up to perform throughout the night.  This is a nice thing to watch while you wait for the next show.Even though the food smelled delicious, I cannot comment on the dinner because we didn't eat.  I was fortunate enough to go with a member, which does not require us eating dinner.  I did try the French Fry appetizer (which you can order at the bar) and they were very yummy large seasoned potato wedges.    I believe the entrance is $20 per person AND you have to pay for dinner.  This is after you receive a guest pass from any member of the Magic Castle.  Valet is mandatory ($3) and they have a coat check.  If you ever need a Magician for a private party, banquet or social event, contact kellyspades.com.  He's young, energetic, funny, super talented, a fellow Yelper, and not bad on the eyes either.  ;-)(ROTD #2)",5 star rating

I've heard so many greats things about the Magic Castle that when the bf got an invite, I was stoked! This is the place were world famous magicians are born! How cool is that??Open sesame and we were in! We caught a quick rope show before our 8pm dinner reservation, which was a great way to start of the night. I had the prime rib, while he got the NY strip steak. Both were delicious and cooked to perfection! The prime rib was so juicy and tender and the slab was very generous too. The service was very fast and efficient. Overall, it was a very satisfying meal.

1569,3/12/2009,"(Cue in Europe's ""The Final Countdown"")Soak it in...you have to have the song playing in your head in order to read this review. It is a prerequisite. Got it? (Get David Blaine and Siegfried and Roy out of your head...not the same.)The Magic Castle is one of Hollywood's most exciting entertainment clubs featuring some of the world's greatest magicians and entertainers. The rules of admittance are fairly strict; you must be a member of the club or be invited by a member. But don't fret if you don't happen to know a magician or a member of the elite Magic Castle society -- you can still find a way to go. The dress code is formal/evening wear, so don't even THINK of wearing a tube top, shorts and UGG boots. You won't even make it past the valet. Once we made ourway inside the club, we were escorted into the piano bar. We drank, wandered around and examined the pictures hanging on the wall. There is also a self playing piano. You can walk over to the piano and, with the help of voice recognition, can have it play whatever song you want. I don't think it works with just any song...but it plays on its own, which is like...very cool.Once we got our champagne and cocktail fix, we were seated inside the Houdini Room. If you ever decide to come here for dinner, I recommend the Houdini seance. You will be paying for a bit more -- but it's highly entertaining when a large group is involved, plus you get priority admittance into the theatre magic shows. The food was good -- but not spectacular. The appetizer was a rather silly arrangement of crumbled hard boiled egg, onion and black caviar with toast. Not my favorite, but after having 3 champagne glasses -- it was decent. Our dinner also included a corn chowder of sorts, steak and dessert. Each dish was paired with wine and champagne. Super!After dinner, the ""medium"" entered the room and proceeded with a back story on Houdini, Houdini's wife and other creepy stories. I won't give up the creepy happenings of the Seance itself, but let me just say that It. Was. Awesome!!!! I really felt a presence in the room and although everyone in my party dismissed it and laughed during the paranormal activities, I soaked it in and welcomed the spirits -- good or evil -- with open arms. The magic show in the main theatre was great. Very entertaining and funny. We drank A-LOT throughout the night and caught a few other acts in the secret rooms, but I can't honestly recall what I tricks I saw. The only thing that I remember was going from sober to drunk to drunker to passing out in the limo...on my boyfriend's crotch. ""TA-DAAAAA!""I think this is a once in a lifetime experience and everyone should go...It's a great time and you get to look fabulous!Plus, if you are invited by someone else and you get your picture taken at the club, you get a FREE pass to come back any time (for up to 9 people) with the purchase of the photo!  Hocus Pocus Focus!",5 star rating

1571,5/30/2016,"My husband and I went to The Magic Castle for our third anniversary. I was excited because of the exclusivity and mystique surrounding the club plus I liked the idea of their  dressy attire dress code. Upon arrival we took some selfies on their mini red carpet and prepared for a night of intrigue. The Magic Castle is a restaurant and a club for magicians. Well I can safely report that they fail in one and excel in the other. Unfortunately the food was NOT GOOD. It wasn't disgusting but for the price it was a huge disappointment. Actually, who am I kidding....even if the food was cheap it would have been a huge disappointment. It was soggy, kinda cold and just plain not very good. I had the prime rib and my husband had the chicken....if we NEVER eat food from The Magic Castle again it will be too soon. The magic shows on the other hand were delightful! We were treated to a history lesson in magician-ship from past to present. The Castle is a fun adventure and we enjoyed exploring all of the little nooks and crannies. Will we ever go back? NO. Food is important and you can not require that a meal be purchased and serve BAD food. If you have always wanted to go to The Magic Castle go ahead and go...just don't expect to enjoy your required meal...BUT if you are on the fence, SAVE YOUR MONEY...and go get a good meal and catch a magic show elsewhere, you will be glad you did :-)",3 star rating
1572,1/31/2012,"If you get an invite opportunity to visit this place, do not pass it up. I was here 2 weekends ago with my girlfriend and my family, celebrating my brother's birthday. He got an invite from a friend who is a member. Keep in mind you have to be a member of the club or be invited by a member to set foot inside The Magic Castle. It gets pretty crowded that's for sure, and be prepared to look spiffy and formal for evening visits. As uncomfortable formal wear is, it was ok to endure such to catch the magic show.(I didn't get to) But be sure to feed the piano some money and request a song to play for you. There's varous shows going on, before your reservation show starts, so wander around and check out the whole place. You'll find table magicians from corner to corner.The restaurant side is pretty up there, food isn't cheap, and sorry - no taking home leftovers. Expect to pay in upwards of $50-60 a person. 1 Entree minimum, so come hungry, especially if the appetizers, and additional sides sound absolutely yummy too (like the Lobster Mac & Cheese). The cheese bread is awesome, the rolls they server seemed to be similar to croissants. I ordered the new york strip steak medium w/ the lobster tail on the side. That steak just MELTS in your mouth! And to add further gluttony, dip the steak into the melted butter (from the lobster tail) LOL! The show. So good... and funny... All I gotta say, when you see magic happen in front of you eyes, it's freakin' TRIPPY! You're going to be like,""No way!"" ""How did he do that???""It was a fun night of food, conversations and magic tricks. Don't pass up the opportunity on coming here. Bring cash for the valet.",4 star rating
1573,8/18/2011,"It's a must! My friend's dad is a member of the Magic Castle and he was able to get 8 passes for a group of us to go. I have heard much about the Magic Castle so I was really excited to go. In preparation to go to the Magic Castle, you have to be in formal attire. Ladies and gents, that means it's time to get fancy. For the ladies, dresses (I think skirts might be ok?) and for the men, collared shirts, ties, and dress shoes. When I arrived there, I gave my my car over to the valet, went in to pay the $20 entrance fee, and made my way into the castle through a bookshelf passage way. Awesome! Then it was off to dinner.Dinner was surprisingly really good. I was thinking that a place known for magic shows would just have mediocre food but it wasn't. And the service was attentive and fun. I ordered the Penne with Rock Shrimp that came with a sherry vinegar tomato cream sauce. It was great! I also ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese. It was kind of dry. How can you fuck that dish up? Well, they did here, but the great tasting penne made up for it. To drink I ordered a cosmo ""with magic and fire!"". Did it come with magic and/or fire? No. But when we got the got the bill, it said that they included FIRE in the cosmo free of charge. Ha! We all thought it was funny at the table. Maybe you just had to have been there. Anywho...After dinner, it was off to see a magic show at the main stage. My friends and I ordered more drinks and waited for the show to start. The show was very entertaining, funny, and kind of cheesy at times. We loved it. After the main show, we saw some card tricks at a smaller table where you can see it close up and interact with the magicians. That was also really fun and entertaining.

Partly because of it's exclusivity, but also because I enjoy a bit of magic every now & again.There was a $25 pp entrance fee.We came and had dinner and drinks. For dinner I had the Salmon plate, and started with a bowl of potato leek soup. The soup was really good. It was nice and creamy, and had a good flavor. I would have like to add crackers but it was still good. The Salmon was nice. It didn't have the fishy taste you sometimes get with salmon. The rice complemented the salmon seasoning. She ordered the prime rib plate. I had a taste, and it was good. Not the best prime rib I've ever had, especially considering the price.We watched a few shows, and took in all of the ambience that this place had to offer. It met every expectation that I had, plus more. I'd like to return if given the opportunity.

1575,2/8/2009,"A special shout out to Magic Mike J. (2008 Junior Magician of the Year) for getting me into the castle.  Check him out on Yelp-- yelp.com/biz/magician-ma… and/or at his personal website magicmikela.com  The Magic Castle is freakin' AWESOME!  Some of the shows were on the cheesy side, but that's the type of magic I like!  I had a blast interacting with the magicians. The entire ""castle"" is just a fun place to hang out in too if you don't care for the magic.I had early reservations and I noticed that the crowd tend to be a bit older (fine by me actually).  Around 9PM is when all the young, hot people come out.  Be sure to get in line early and don't dilly dally in between shows or else you might not get in.  The rooms get filled up really quickly.This place is great for group outings, but try not to have a large group because some of the shows can only accommodate 22 people at a time so it would suck if you all got split up.  I say just to be safe, don't have more than 4-5 people in a group.The food and entrance fee set me back at least $55 and parking was $8.  Be prepared to spend a little here.  As for drinks, they have some pretty awesome looking martinis and Long Island Iced Teas.  I ordered a cranberry juice ($3) and it came  in this cute, tall glass.  The waitress told me I could get refills if I wanted to, which was nice to know.I asked one of the ushers here why cameras were not allowed and he told  me that the rule dates back to the days when Carrie Grant used to perform at the Magic Castle.  People used to bug him non-stop for a photo op and it got really annoying.  The poor guy just wanted to hang out and perform a few tricks.  He didn't want to be known as ""Carrie Grant--Hollywood Mega Star"" and have a billion people try to sneakily take a picture of him so the castle banned cameras in his honor.If I ever get another invitation, I am totally bringing my brother.  He's not 21 yet so I couldn't bring him this time around.",5 star rating

""Open sesame..""Left to wander, and wonder, I found hidden details tucked among the nooks and crannies. Surprises for those who take the time to notice, like the amazing Alphonse Mucha reproduction in the music room, and the cherub room in the upstairs dining area. Stairwells abound, and there seem to be bars around every corner. They were eeriely empty though, ghost bars in the twinkling sunlight. I look forward to visiting again, in the evening, to watch the spirits flow. The building is expansive, the service impeccable, and the food quite good. The magic itself is better left without description, and experienced with innocence. The Magic Castle is certainly an experience worth whatever little feats of magic you may need to perform to procure your reservations.",4 star rating
1580,6/25/2012,"Bought the $100 trial membership. Steep, but if you don't know someone it's a great way to get in. The place reminds me of a Tardis. It's much bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. Went for Sunday Brunch on Fathers Day. Absolutely packed. The staff was pressed, but very helpful. Shows were entertaining for young (12 yr) and old (89 yr) group.. Best to walk around looking for the few Magicians practicing their arts tableside or in smaller crowd settings.Food was better than expected given the reviews. It's a buffet - mass produced food for the hurry up and eat crowd. Variety was spot on for breakfast. They had an excellent poached salmon worth going back for seconds. Drinks are stiff in price, but not in strength, something that could be improved. The place is a vintage property. It's supposed to look and feel historic, but it doesn't have to smell old. If I ran the place, 2-3 time the current air circulation per hour would help. A couple of weeks of rest for a thorough cleaning, restoring some of the wood and carpets, and a measure of straightening up would turn it into a 5 star joint quickly.Will be returning in July for the dinner package.

1581,7/20/2011,"Had a great time both times I was there in June. I got the Open Sesame offer for 100.00 which lets you in unlimited times for a month with one guest, and still gets your friends in, paying 20.00 for weekdays and 25.00 weekends. (limit to 8 people)One thing I didn't like is that the place is always crowded, and although there are several magic shows happening all the time,(there are 5-6 theatres inside the castle) there are always lines. much like Disneyland.. You don't have to have dinner at the castle but if you do, you get a ""pass"" that lets you skip the line to one of the main shows. (You choose) So that is nice and covenient. Because most of the time, those shows will fill up with dining patrons. The food is not horrible like comedy clubs, so I would suggest having dinner. The other thing is, the later you get there, the more crowded.. so if you are going for the magic, early is good.. if you are going for the scene.. then whatever..It is one of those places that you have to go at least once.",4 star rating
1582,10/22/2009,"I am your biggest cynic when it comes to magic. I was told to walk into this experience with an open mind and to just, well. Believe. Upon walking in, you will need to tell this wooden owl with scary looking blue eyes, ""open sesame."" Make sure you either turn off your phones or at least keep it on vibrate. It takes away from the magical experience!While we waited downstairs at the bar for our reservations, we listened to Irma tickling the ivories. I requested Britney Spears ""Toxic"" but she played something else. Oh well. Didn't think that would be possible but I just wanted to give it a shot! What can I say about the dinner besides it being absolutely mediocre? They had a specials menu and I was going for seafood. I noticed they had a steamed mussels and clams linguine dish under the specials section and a seafood linguine under the regular menu. I asked the waiter what the difference was between the two dishes. And what is the difference you ask? The seafood linguine has only clams! You have your choice of red or white sauce. The red sauce tasted NAH-STEE. I have a pretty good appetite and I couldn't even stomach half of this dish. Their crab cakes were probably the highlight of the dinner. Battered on the outside and juicy and full of crabby flavor on the inside. It was finger-licking good!Now, onto the magic shows. You have three different areas to choose from and there are a few show times for each show. I had the opportunity to go to the close-up gallery, the parlour of prestidigitation, and watch the performers at the palace of mystery. Overall decent shows but they made it up with their witty jokes.  My favorite magician was the guy from the close-up gallery. You don't usually get to see their tricks up close and I definitely walked out stumped with my jaw dragging along the floor. My suggestion is that you line up extra early for the close-up gallery as the room capacity is at 21 so the line builds up fast.Everything about this place screams old Hollywood glamor and I loved it. It was a pleasant experience and I am grateful for having the opportunity  in coming. Any chance to get all dolled up and wear a nice dress and heels!",3 star rating
1583,5/6/2008,"The Magic Castle is legit. I promise I'm not biased, but I have been a member since I was 13 (so 9 years now lol).  The Castle is an amazing experience- whether you've gone once or many, many times. It's one of the last old school Hollywood joints. It's like Disneyland/the Haunted Mansion for adults. With booze. You have to be with a member or have a pass from a member to get in- the biggest downfall is it's pricey, but it's definitely one of the most unique/cool LA nights out. Definitely try to go in with a member if you can- If you do, you don't have to pay the $20-25 door charge (and on top of that, you don't have to buy dinner either). The (pretty awesome) drinks are around from $7-15 each and the food is around $30 per person (the wine is the best deal, good pours are legit). There's a pretty big emphasis on drinking, since it makes the magic far, far better.I highly reccomend: -the potato wedges-the calamari DO NOT get the chicken masala. Bland sauce. Dry chicken. Why did I opt for Indian food at a place not even known for their regular food? Ask the booze. I'd much rather the chicken masala from trader joe's for a lot less.Onion rings are ok- they were the kind where they give you like 5 huge ones, which in my opinion are just annoying to eat since the onion slides out in one bite.All in all, go, it's awesome.When to go:-Sun-Wed: Super slow, way easier to get around. A lot less waiting in line.-Thurs: My favorite day- sometimes it's slow, but it's generally bumping enough where it feels happening, but not as much as...-Fri/Sat: Definitely the most packed. This can be fun, but it generally is really, really packed. Which means  the bigger the group, the more coordinating and waiting in line that has to be done.-Mikemagicmikela.comyelp.com/biz/magician-ma…P.S. If you need a pass, let me know!",4 star rating

1586,12/28/2014,"To be honest, I have not heard of the prestigious MAGIC CASTLE until my friends invited me to it for my birthday celebration. My boyfriend told me it is a very exclusive club and not to give up on the chance to go if invited. I took the offer right away and was nervous about what to wear and what to expect for an entire week.  I finally put on my little black dress feeling like I was a celebrity going to my very own movie premier. Once I walked past the hidden bookshelf door, I was instantly transported into a magical world with a classy atmosphere all around. Everyone was dressed in their best attire holding a drink and socializing like everyone knew each other.We arrived at 7pm, but our dinner reservation was at 8pm so we had a chance to explore the castle and see some magicians perform their magic.  It was really amazing to see magic in person.  I even got to participate in some of them too!  One of the most memorable magicians was El Ropo who is a very tall man with a cowboy hat.  You can't miss him.  If you get a chance, I'd highly recommend you see his performance.  He is very entertaining to watch and he puts on a great performance with his rope magic.  As for the food, I had the rib eye and my boyfriend had the filet of beef.  I actually prefer the filet more since the rib eye was on the rough side.  Their mixed drinks are pretty good too.  There are many bars located throughout the castle.  Like they said, the more you drink, the better the magic.Overall, the Magic Castle is a great place to enjoy fascinating magic shows and you also get a chance to socialize with real magicians in an intimate setting.  It was a great way to celebrate my birthday and I can't wait to return!",5 star rating
1587,11/2/2010,"I finally got a chance to step foot into this mysteriously exclusive castle, in my one shoulder dress. My car door was opened by the valet and I was greeted by the hostess. She gave us a badge which we had to wear throughout the night. Dress code is strict, full suit for guys and dress for girls. We walked down to the basement and had some appetisers which were very bland. the bruchetta were alright, but the chicken on the stick was just boiled. The shrimp was alright. I managed to catch 2 shows that night. 10pm with Daniel Zirbiel, 6ft tall and winner of crystal award and the musically lively J Neal and his assistant Liane. This show lasted an hour. Zirbiel was very good and suave, whereas Neal was charismatic and energetic. Both fantastic magicians!The second show I caught was with Arthur Trace, commended as the most unique magician. He won the International Brotherhood of Magicians ""Gold Medal International Award of Excellence."" Trace was humourous and slightly dorky. Another enjoyable show, lasted only half an hour.I did get a chance to explore the 3 floors of the castle. It felt rather dark and mysterious. It was smaller than I expected, with a myriad of surprises. The dining room also looks beautiful. ***Tip: Go to each performance at least 20 minutes before starting. There are longer and shorter performances. Some are close up, some are not. Bigger rooms, etc. Diners have first priority. Photographs ARE allowed in hallway, just not in the magic rooms. Be courteous. Formal wear only. They even provide suit jackets.

1588,8/6/2012,"Went there for a team dinner last year with my fellow coworkers and supervisor. I really liked the atmosphere and the food was decent- I had the prime rib (Kinda pricey too). The magic shows were pretty decent, it was cool but I was not THAT amazed. What made our night was the final show we decided to check out. It was some guy (forgot name) who had a previous award for close up magic tricks. Well, I really was hoping I did not get selected from the crowd to volunteer but guess what! I was chosen! Well, to make a long story short I totally jacked up his performance. Yea, pretty badly too. I mean it was like watching a train wreck. I didn't mean to and I felt really bad but my coworkers thought it was hilarious. Overall, it was definitely an experience for me and my coworkers. I would not be surprised if they had my picture on their wall saying ""Do not choose this guy!"" lol.",4 star rating
1589,3/31/2015,Loved the shows.  I almost try to go there once a week.  The food is good but it could definitely be better.  I think they have changed the chef a couple of years ago.  Granted I am a vegetarian and have not tried the steak but the fish could be better. But at the end it is a true magical place.  You would love it and would have an unforgettable memory.,4 star rating
1590,11/2/2009,"Ways to make Halloween more fun as an adult than it was as a child? Come to the Magic Castle.You will be greeted by a full sized coffin loaded foot-deep with candy. And for those of you who would feel guilty taking more than one piece, they have bags right there begging to be stuffed full of their premium, hip-and-ass inflating candy. Yay!You will see the castle tricked out in decor befitting their yearly themes. This year the bloodied, bashed and bruised baby dolls littering the mantles, bars and walls represented their ""Night of the Living Dead Dolls"" motif. Everything from barf-inducingly ugly Chuckielike dolls to cute little teddy bears wrapped up in chains mean that every corner here holds even more secrets than during the rest of the year.And if you are really lucky during this most crowded of nights,  and get to see the main show at the palace, your senses will be bombarded by a mixture of magic, comedy, circus, burlesque, and goth to please all but the sourest of attendees. Plus, once you are pleasantly buzzed, your heels hurt (this isn't just a comment for the ladies-I saw more than a few dudes in drag) and you realize that a fortune has been spent and you are ready to turn in your valet ticket, you get offered a goody bag with special souvenirs as you leave.

1591,6/24/2013,"where's the magic? where's the castle? :(I'm utterly disappointed with my first visit to the magic castle. The driveway up to valet is killer. It's $10 w/dinner validation - dinner is mandatory. It was an additional $25/person to be admitted into the castle. We were only able to book the 9:45 slot so we snacked beforehand while watching some of the small shows around the castle. i was expecting a spectacular castle experience: lights and dancers hanging from ceiling, random magic acts at different corners of the room, and just ooo's and ahh's all around. it just looked like a big house with lots of weird pictures, statues, and furnitures. there was not much to take pictures with but even if there were, you're not allowed to take pictures inside. castle = 2 starsdrinks were fairly stiff. they seemed to know what they're doing. the bar food were pretty good. calamari was hot and crispy. aioli dip was perfect. truffle fries were pretty amazing. bar = 3 starswe were seated 15mins late and our server kept reiterating how late we were running and we'd have to rush through dinner. she was a little rude, too. she was trying to go through the special fish of the day and hushed one of our friends as he was still in conversation. it wasn't like we couldn't hear her passed him.. it was just that he wasn't paying attention. but what did she think she was? our teacher? service= 1 star.. pooeyfood came fairly slow, but it was a big order. however, i figured since they said we're running late that they'd push the plates out of the kitchen faster. the prime rib was cooked perfectly - medium rare. flavor was all there but the meat was a little too tough for medium rare. it wasn't that type of rare chewiness. it was as if the meat was almost cooked through. i'd give it 3-stars. the chilean sea bass was amazing. it was flakey and light in flavor. buttery but not overwhelming. 5-stars for the sea bass! we also ordered the lava cake w/vanilla bean ice cream. it was just a chocolate cake w/vanilla bean ice cream. fudge did not ooze out of the center of the cake as it should. plus, i had to practically shove the dessert down my throat since they were rushing us to head over to our 11:15 showing. lava cake would be 2 stars.. hmph!now the show... i thought it was going to be legit magic with things disappearing and just anythng that would leave me in awe. but no.. i felt like i was watching a clown's performance at a child's birthday party. juggling.. simple disappearing acts.. lame tricks.. a parrot ((sigh)) i mean, the performer was a great character and humored us, but totally not worth even just the admittance fees!! our entire party walked out of that show pretty dazed and asking each other ""wtf was that?"" main show = 1 star.. womp womp womppros:- stiff drinks- great food- interest experience (walking around and catching the small shows)cons:- valet driveway- admittance (must be a member/know a member and still pay $25/person)- boring interior- rushed dinner- main act was a jokei don't think i' would ever return to the castle unless it was free entry. i'd come back just to eat, drink and check out the random acts. until i'm blown away by the main act, i will not understand the hype that this place has.",2 star rating

1594,2/5/2009,"Well, just got back from an evening at the Magic Castle in Hollywood.  My girlfriend and I took my mother, who has never been to Los Angeles.  We figured it would be a special thing to do for my mother's visit, and given the Castle's rep, we expected a relatively elegant affair at an exclusive club with the fun twist of magic to make it truly special.If you don't already know, they claim to have a strict dress code and ban cell phone use inside the castle.  We were seated at dinner next to two women in sweat suits who talked on their phones the whole time.  It wasn't so much the dress code and cell phone violations, it was the fact that they spent the whole time loudly discussing, in broken english, the exchange of money for sex acts.  Yep.  We were chillin' with full-on prostitutes (don't get excited guys, they were seriously ugly disgusting trolls).  Yep.  What an elegant night with my family.  Nothing like trying to swallow a bite of filet mignon while listening to a wacked out  hooker quote $350 for full service and $100 for a handjob (cash only) NEXT TO MY MOM.  Ahhh... good times at The Castle. Classy operation.Besides the barrage of sex-for-sale phone calls, they chewed with their mouths open super loud and demanded the waiter's attention in the rudest possible way, even when he was serving other tables.  For a few minutes I was sure that we were on a candid camera show but no one came out and sprung the joke on us.So, naturally, we felt compelled to inform the management they had two jacked up ho-bags openly soliciting sex for hire in their dining room and figured management would, of course, opt to politely eject them based on  the ""strict dress code"" and ""no cell phone"" rules without having to accuse them of anything.  Well, guess what?  We were promptly informed that these two lovely gems WERE MEMBERS. That's right. These repulsive, rude, nasty-ass prostitutes were actually members of the Magic Castle. A polite ""We have warned them."" is about all we got for a response from management. After seeing that management was not phased by our story at all, we quickly got the sense that this is just what goes on here. Even if the management sanctioned such activity, we figured after receiving such a direct and pointed complaint, they would at least ask the cantankerous hookers to take the night off.  Wrong.  Those same rude and grotesque creatures were slithering around the castle all night long, clearly looking to drum up some business with one or more of the traveling salesmen in cheap suits.I would never pass any judgement on what they do for a living but belligerent hookers will pretty much ruin any special night you had planned with your mom.  What was supposed to be a special night for us turned into an expensive downer.  The magic performers were terrific and the decor is great.  Just don't expect elegance or a refined experience.  It's sad because the Magic Castle has so much rich history and you can tell it used to be a class act.  Someone new needs to take over, get rid of the ""New Jersey motel by the turnpike vibe"", and restore that place back to its classic Hollywood glory.",2 star rating
1595,6/5/2011,"I went here for one of my friend's daughter's birthday party. My friend and her husband had rented a private room. It was quite an elaborate party and a real treat. The magicians are engaging and charismatic. The kids were just amazed. They really enjoyed that the magician took volunteers so some of the children could stand up front and assist in the magic trick. One little girl however ruined a trick by pointing out the string on a floating dollar bill! It was hilarious and the magician took it in good humor. This was the only trick we figured out. The others were all good fun. The children really enjoyed it. I also think the Magic Castle would be a nice place for adults. A nice cocktail with a show can be a nice break in the rhythm of everyday life. I do believe you have to be a member to go however.

With that said the dress code is not strongly enforced with ladies; as long as u wear a dress u can get in. Taste is not a criteria as I got beaver shots from left to right. for the most part it seemed like the hang out for rich silver hair folks. The acts were ok. Some people were asleep; that may just come with the territory... One star was for decor which is absolutely flaw-less! The other star was for the food, which is DELICIOUS!

1599,10/7/2014,"This is a great place to come for a night of entertainment and elegance.  TIP:  Arrive as early as possible!  Sometimes they cancel the last showings of the night if there are not enough people and it's important to line up early, especially for the big show in the main room.  (Dinner guests are first serve for the main show meaning they won't let you in until after they go in so if you are 10th in line, you may not get in depending on how many dinner guests show up.)  The shows in the small rooms can be just as interesting as the main room show and don't forget the bars also have card tricks and mini shows that can be fun as well.  There are lots of cool little bar areas throughout the castle, including the popular one with the ghost/piano player that takes requests (and tips).  I have come many times over the years on all nights of the week.  Sundays are family day (a bit more casual dress also, no jeans/t-shirts/flip flops), it's kid friendly and I believe they do a brunch type menu.  (I did this about 5 yrs ago, it may have changed.)  NOTE: The dress code is formal, meaning men must wear a suit & tie and women a dress or dress attire. Shows vary, as do the performers.  Some nights will be more amazing than others.  The first time I came, the show was so impressive, I was a bit disappointed the following times I came.  However, the castle itself is so beautiful and filled with twists and turns, just going there for some drinks, exploring, etc is fun, even if you're not that into magic.  As for the pricing, I always came with an invite (IE: on the list).  I believe I paid around $8-10 parking, but I don't remember ever paying a cover.  Most of the time, I just came for the shows and had drinks at the bar.  I never came for dinner, however I did come once for their group dinner package: Houdini Seance Dinner (12 person min I believe)  I don't know what we paid, but I do know the wine was unlimited.  (A good idea on their part considering what came next.)   I really like this place, but I have to be honest, I thought the seance dinner was very cheesy.  It's ok if you go into it knowing that.  Nothing serious... at all.  It's very ""Disney"" to me.  I could see how some of the tricks were being done (as the ""glamorous assistant"") sitting next to the performer.  Other tricks were just a bit childish to me.  I don't want to give anything away, but the food was good and if you're there for some laughs you will probably enjoy it. For me, out of all the magic I've seen there over the years, the Houdini Seance was the least impressive and a bit laughable to be honest.  I would do it again with a group if the price was right since the food was decent.  Either way, I tend to come out here whenever I'm invited just because it's a fun, unique venue with plenty of entertainment.",4 star rating
1600,6/20/2014,"I finally got an invite to this exclusive mansion and it was totally worth it. There is a strict dress code and a $30 entrance fee that presumably covers your ticket to the main show. No pictures are allowed once you pass the lobby. To pass the lobby you have to say the magic words to an owl in a bookcase. I enjoyed that part haha. Once inside you are greeted by a host  and informed of all of the rooms you can visit. On this floor there is a room with a piano that plays any song you tell it to, a bar, and a room for close up magic. Downstairs has a stage where a magician performs, a bar when a magician apparently performs and serves drinks, a fun house style mirror, and a hallway with various things to do and see. Upstairs is the restaurant. You have to eat to get your ticket for the main show. A way to get people to spend but the food si good. I enjoyed my prime rib and side of mac and cheese.After dinner you watch the main show. Magicians perform for a week before they are rotated out. My show was pretty good. The host was awesome and the two other magicians were alright. One of them did silly comedy magic that I didn't really enjoy too much. I came for shock and awe. When that was over you are allowed to roam around to the various rooms that magicians perform in. Wait in line and watch the show. Most of the shows were very. Great magicans.

We got there 5:30P sharp on a Wednesday night. Mostly a mature crowd. Dress to impress! They are very strict about dress code. Loved that they had a bar on every floor; practically every where you turned. We drank the whole 5 hours there LOL. Dinner was surprisingly good! A bit under Maestro's Steakhouse standard. We both had the special - he had 2 lobster tails and I, the 8 oz. filet mignon. Both were cooked to perfection. Just the right portions. The banana creme pie al a mode was to die for. We saw only two magic shows as seats filled up fast. You walk through the castle to catch showings of each magic show. The shows were nothing I've never seen before but good entertainment, especially 3 glasses of wine deep. Good for get-togethers and dates. My favorite was Erma, the ghost pianist who plays in a small area near the bar. Service was great.

They handed me a smelly, linen jacket that was four times too big for me and told me they wouldn't let me in until I put it on.

I saw three other jackets inside with zippers on them, two guys that had leather pants on (leather pants. really.) yet everytime I tried to take the smelly jacket off someone rushed up to me and told me I'd be escorted out of the ""club"" if I didn't put it back on.At this point I decided I wasn't spending any money at this place, and never going back again, but as it was a friend's birthday I had to wait it out through dinner. Dinner was a joke: Our waiter was absent for most of the meal, never refilled our glasses, and served our dinner salads with such huge globs of dressing on them that none of us could eat them. The food just wasn't that great to justify the cost. Overall the meal was mediocre, the camera man was overly persistant in his pitch to take our picture (which none of us wanted) at dinner (taking pictures of people eating? really?) and it took forever to get our check.If you are into lame guys in leather pants with Kenny G. hair, rude receptionists and absent waiters, this is the place for you. The magic, btw, has never impressed me in the half a dozen shows I've been to (maybe because magic is lame overall, but that's just my opinion.)Don't go here. Save your money and go somewhere else.",1 star rating
1611,5/11/2015,"The Type A guide to maximizing magic at The Magic Castle (Warning: Long and neurotic)Well, first off - if you can, befriend a member and get them to take you on a day that they're going - you skip the cover charge and aren't required to get the overpriced dinner (that gives you more time for magic - although then you aren't guaranteed tickets to the main show). You can also try emailing performers the week that you will be there to see if they have any extra passes to give away (which may or may not lift the cover and dinner requirement, depending on how generous they are).If you are not as lucky and are a mere muggle like me who managed to magically score a guest pass, then read on...1) Check the schedule. It's posted 6 weeks in advance online: magiccastle.com/schedule Look for the days with the close up 5-7pm performer, as well as magic in the Peller Theater and WC Fields bar. If they have performances on a Thursday or Sunday, go then (Friday and Saturday are notoriously busy). Bonus on Thursdays is that cover is $20 instead of 30 on the weekends. On these days with the extra shows, there are a total of 8 different shows (3 Close up, 2 Parlour, 1 Palace, 1 Peller, 1 WC Fields) rather than the regular 5 (2 Close up, 2 Parlour, 1 Palace).  However, if you must go on a Saturday, book early! When I called 7 weeks ahead of time to inquire about availability, there was only one Saturday seating left.2) 6pm dinner reservation (if you must). This is because there is only one performer (the early early close up magician) before 7pm, so you are missing less. Also, only order the bare minimum (an entrée) so you don't take up valuable time getting served an appetizer and dessert too. This is not a Michelin star restaurant, so who cares. Eating is a formality here.  We were seated right as soon as the dining room opened and with the one entree, dinner took almost an hour.  I will say that dinner was not as bad as expected.  The service was good, and the Honey Soy Sea Bass was actually pretty good - just overpriced at $37.3) Schedule for the night (yes, you CAN see 7 of the 8 shows on a less busy night if you want...)  You can see all but the early close up performer, or early parlor performer.5pm - arrive, see early early close up performer5:45pm - (as soon as the dining room opens) - dinner6:40pm - Hang out in the piano bar with Irma and keep an eye on the line for the 7:45 early close up show (assuming the line for the 7pm close up show is full).7:45 pm (line up at 7:00 to 7:15pm) - early close up show (20 mins) - Most people are saying line up 30 mins in advance for the close up room on here, but we were in line at 7 for the 7:45 show, and only made standing room!  I think this might be the most popular time to see a show, because it gets both the people who finished 6:00 dinner, as well as those who have an 8:00 dinner reservation.  An alternative is to see the 7:15 early parlor show, but you'll miss the close up show.8:30 (line up after the close up show ends, at 8:05) - Palace show (45 mins)9:15 - If you're lucky, you can run to the Parlor and see the early performer whose show is starting ASAP (but don't count on it).  If not, then hang out with Irma and keep an eye on the line for the close up room.10:00 (line up at 9:30pm) - late close up show10:20 - head to the WC Fields bar and watch a couple sets (which were actually my favorite of the evening because it was close up yet informal), or explore the nooks and crannies of the castle.11:30 (line up at 11:10 or so - you can keep an eye on the line from the WC Fields bar) - Peller Theatre (30 mins or so?)12:30 - late Parlor show4)  There is also some great close up stuff by member magicians present that night while you are sitting around near the bars.   Unfortunately, the magicians aren't allowed to perform for you while you're in line; that would make the 30-45 minute lines a bit more bearable!  You are, however, able to leave the close up line to get a drink once you've claimed your spot.  In terms of quality of magic, there were definitely some tricks that I could figure out how it was done in general, but I still loved the delivery.5) Make sure you go over the dress code and save up your money to spend here to avoid any surprises.  I'm not going to go over dress code or prices here - other reviews have already done that quite nicely.  The only thing I was really surprised by was how much waiting around there was for the close-up shows.  But it was worth it!tl;dr: magic is fun.  go!",5 star rating

1613,1/16/2009,"First off, a big thanks to Magic Mike for making my magical evening possible. And now I shall make my review....appear! (That's the best I can do as far as spellbinding skills.)I'd recommend getting there early and queuing up for the Close-Up Gallery, since it only seats less about twenty people. If the group is full of newbs, they may not realize that you can sit in the two chairs up front and be part of the show...don't be shy! I also love all the little secret things going on, and poking around and discovering them...Next time, I'd like to finagle our way onto a tour (the site says that ""Castle Knights"" lead these on the weekends, but there seemed to be one going on while we were there on a Monday, but we only caught the end of it).A few fun things to do:- Step into the phone booth next to the entrance to the Palace of Mystery- Press the button above the ""Haunted Mansion"" sign downstairs in the W.C. Fields bar for a little Disney trivia/spooky demo- Open the furnace door at the Hart & Hare Pub - Apparently the men's bathroom mocks you, but I didn't sneak in there so I wouldn't knowI have to say one of my favorite parts of the evening was requesting songs from Irma the piano playing ghost. (Don't forget to tip the seemingly empty cage with the invisible bird!) Yes, apparently I'm easily amused by a player piano, but if you're already at the ""magic"" castle then you must be willing to exercise some suspension of disbelief. Note: Irma retires fairly early in the evening, so make sure you go pay her a visit before the late shows.Also, make sure you take a closer look at the posters decorating the walls, you just might recognize the performers you just saw---say, immortalized by Matt Groening as a Simpson-esque character, or a disco-fabulous poster from a gig back in the '70s. I overheard a couple magic men saying that Neil Patrick Harris is on the board of directors. NPH!  That just makes the Magic Castle that much cooler in my book.",4 star rating
1614,7/3/2013,"A truly unique experience.  Once is very special but the second time I went it was quite disappointing.  I think it was a very off night when we were there most recently on July 1st.  Having been to the Magic Castle before, I knew they are very snooty and maybe some people find that appealing, however the food was average and the service during our dinner was awful.  We had to ask for water several times, when we first sat down, and ordered a bottle of wine that took quite some time to get, as for the other drinks some in our party just went to the bar instead.  Our waiter was very slow and had many sarcastic and snide comments that he made under his breath.Yes, they are obsessed with men keeping their jackets on at all times, other than when seated eating.  Members have no qualms about 'dressing down' guys for standing up to put on their jackets when moving to the magic show.We also happened to be there on this night when they were having auditions in the basement, although there was no sign to indicate that and we thought the men gathered at the table were simply doing card tricks.  We were reprimanded and told to leave so we wandered towards another area and someone came over to tell us we had to leave all areas downstairs, even though one of their employees suggested we go downstairs for something to do as the shows were full at the time.  Apparently the other basement was also closed due to a board meeting.  Irma was also on a 'break' for quite a long time and when we went back to her parlor area, it was packed since there was little else to do.  OH YES, WE SPENT OVER $800 for this experience and rude behavior.After reliving the evening, I've changed my rating from 3 to 2 stars.  However the first time I was there with my daughter and her friends for her 21st birthday we had a fantastic experience and the food was terrific, as was our waiter. (although some rude member snidely remarked towards the girls as they walked past that he thought you had to be 21 to get in- they were you jerk!)  The first time I would have rated it 5 stars.  Hopefully, some changes will be in the offing.",2 star rating
1615,6/12/2006,"I have one word for you...UNREAL.  The whole Magic Castle experience is so unbelievable from start to finish!!  The house was built by a family who were magic enthusiasts and was opened to the public in 1963 and wasn't expected to last more than 5 years.  Well I am happy to say it did and is alive and well.  You have to either be a member or know someone who is a member of the Magic Castle, because it is by invitation only.  I recently went for the first time on my year anniversary a couple of weeks ago.  As soon as you walk into the front door of the castle you immediately feel like you have stumbled upon something special in the hills of Hollywood.  We were told to go to the Hat-n-Hare pub down the windy flight of steps and tell the bartender that ""Harry sent us"" and he would do something special for us.  We must of sat at that bar for hours, mesmerized by the card tricks our bartender performed for us like it was our own private show.    The castle is HUGE, and you could get lost in it if it weren't for a bar around every corner (my kind of place). There are scheduled shows every hour, a great place for dinner and magicians who are there nightly, practicing their craft on willing audiences.  The Magic Castle is great for dates, big parties and anyone visiting Hollywood because the castle will NOT disappoint.  I highly encourage everybody to make friends with as many magicians as possible, preferably those with memberships to the Magic Castle.",5 star rating
1616,11/5/2008,"Soooo this is my second time going there... when i went there the last time i went in for a brunch buffet cause my mom got a guest pass. The entrance for the brunch ( and I guess now still is ) $25.00 with a guess pass and I believe that included the buffet. BUT MAN i went there for Halloween and the price was hiked to $50.00 not including the dinner .... I ended up paying over $200.00 (considering it's a $15.00 minimum)!!! but that's my fault for not asking ahead... now on to the food..my party ordered : the ny steak, filet mignon, free range chicken, and braised short ribs.The filet mignon was sized right ... had a good taste ( the sauce was ok ) no A-1 horrible.... hahathe ny steak was huge..... and it was good for the 20 something dollarsthe chicken however and the short ribs ( although really good portions wise ) were bland and not as tasty as it looked. But its a magic place...I also had the souffle it was gelatinous i dunno if souffle is supposed to be like that but the accompanied Ice cream was not that good, neither was the 9.00 cheesecake.  the shows were cool but then again we paid $50.00 to see it.Best part was I sat next to mario lopez.( ac slater) ... can't pay for that can you?  hahahhaa",3 star rating

1619,7/29/2009,"Tadaaaaaa!  My 500th review!  [pauses for applause]A friend pulled some strings to get us into the Magic Castle for a bachelorette party, and I was rather excited, although, as noted by Christine K., standing up in your heels outside=ow.  It also seemed odd to me that we had to wait outside in line for at least 10 minutes when we had a reservation.I was given the honor of saying the Magic Words to the book in the bookcase that slides away...and it opens to anything, including my ""Can I say whatever I want?""  Once inside, you could take an extremely long time looking at everything if you aren't rushing upstairs for your dinner reservation.  Dimmed lights, magicians performing up-close card tricks, a piano that will play anything you ask it to, once you put a dollar in the empty adjacent birdcage (I chose a polka standard, yes for realz), and a swank bar my friends dropped quite a bit of money at.The restaurant is quite pretty, what I assume is early 1900's decor, with deep colors and extremely attentive service.  Not much on the menu for vegetarians, since it's essentially a steakhouse, but there's a daily vegetarian special: this particular night, it was mushroom ravioli with various grilled veggies and marinara sauce.  And it was delicious.  The dessert menu looked incredible, but we didn't have time.Folks, make sure you get to your show early, lest you end up in the very back like us.  You aren't supposed to hold seats, either - tell your friends to get their nicotine fix later!!!  The featured magician was HILARIOUS, with amazingly flashy smoking jackets, and capitalized on being gay, as well as embarrassing a rather mundane man in the audience.  The other magician mostly performed tricks I've seen before.Which show to see next, what time?  My friends used unclaimed time to drink; how much of the Magic Castle's income is on booze?  Servers roaming the audiences in the shows only adds to the spending.  Wait time in the theaters led to me talking to a performer/ventriloquist who told me he thought I'd make a great magician (because I seem like a liar?).My drunk friends kind of heckled the magician in our second show, which they said they've done before, but nearby audience members HATED them for it, which I find understandable.  So shhh.I knocked off a star because it was very crowded, hard to get through and I constantly felt squished or afraid of losing my friends.  There must be a max capacity and I'm sure they weren't breaking fire codes, but oof - make it comfortable for the people who pay a lot to attend.",4 star rating
1620,3/12/2007,"Open Sesame!  How fun was this place!!  I jammed over here from dance out in the Moorpark area all the way over to Hollywood in about 40 minutes, in my cocktail dress (of course picking up my date on the way there).  We were only 15 minutes behind my 3 sisters and their husbands by about 10 minutes, the hostess so kindly informed us when we got there.  Then she instructed us to speak to the owl and say ""Open sesame"" which caused the book case doors to open and let you into the rest of the castle.  My Austrian brother-in-law, kindly had a dirty martini made for me before we went into a ""small show"".  It was pretty much THE BEST dirty martini I have ever had.  The small show was a magician that had sleight of hand tricks.  He was pretty darn impressive and convincing.  I probably would've been more convinced if one of the people he chose help him from the audience was one of my sisters or our significant others, because I always convince myself that once of the helpers in an accomplice a la The Prestige.After the small show we were starving so we went to eat at our reservation time at 9:30 pm.  They sat us down at a nice table up in front and I look directly across from me and only to find Mario Lopez.  I had just finished telling Kieran the night before how ""AC Slater"" made my a$$ cringe with his curly mullet and elastic band pants and worst of all his wrestling uniform.  So it was pretty darn hysterical for us to see him of all people. We ordered the crab and artichoke dip, fried calamari, and artichoke hearts for dessert.  Everyone ordered the steak Milton for dinner which they all said was excellent and I ordered the halibut special.  It was pretty good, but a bit over done and bland.  The bill ended up being about $120 per couple.  After dinner we were rushed off to the ""big"" show that started at 11:15 pm.  This was also pretty entertaining, but the ""metal rings"" got pretty old.  The second act was a juggler that was really great to watch.  At the end of the large show I was wiped out and all magiced out.  I know you can arrive as early as you want to catch more of the ""smaller"" shows but I felt that the two were just enough.  There are no pictures allowed inside unfortunately, but they offer to give you one shot by their photographer during dinner...but I passed on the 8 by 10 portrait.  The clientele was pretty interesting that night...and older crowd...but surprisingly sloppy drunk.  The staff was really great, keeping in ""character"" and tradition of the historical venue.  I really like that it isn't completely open to the public and you need ""passes"" to get in or be a member.  I can't wait to go back again and see more magic and drink more martinis!",5 star rating

1623,8/1/2013,"If you're ever in the LA area, you have to visit the Magic Castle at least once! This is an attraction that should not be missed! If you plan to attend the Magic Castle during the evening, you need to obtain a guest pass from a member and book your dinner reservation at least 3-4 weeks in advance. This place is incredibly popular. The Magic Castle has $10 valet parking. Get here as early as possible because traffic is horrible in Hollywood during all evenings. You must adhere to their strict dress code and present your photo ID otherwise they will not let you in. You can find out more about the dress code on their website. The doors open at 5:30pm so you have time to explore the castle or listen to the ghost Irma play the piano. The evening entrance fee is $20/person. The Magic Castle has 2 full bars. The magic shows start at 7pm. It's not unusual for several magic shows to take place simultaneously throughout the Magic Castle. Get there 15-20 minutes before the show starts in order to get good seats.I also loved the food that they served at dinner. Each individual must order at least one entrée for dinner. They also provide a basket of free, sweet, freshly baked dinner rolls. I ordered the filet mignon for my entree and garlic bread for my appetizer. The filet mignon tasted perfect, and the garlic bread was delicious! It was more than enough food to fill me up. Once you're done paying your dinner, they will give you your tickets to watch the Palace of Mystery.The Magic Castle features world-class magicians from all over the globe. All of the magicians are very superb and entertaining in their act. They are all professional magicians. You won't find any amateurs here. I tend to sit towards the back because I'm too shy to get chosen as a volunteer. The shows run until midnight. I love hopping from one magic show to another. They feature all kinds of magic from stage magic to close-up magic. I loved the architecture and interior of the Magic Castle. It's a huge Victorian mansion that's over 100 years old.

1625,3/17/2014,"This place is AWESOME!When my fiancee told me she had gotten us invited, via some bizarre relationship to one of the performing magicians, I immediately turned to Yelp to see what I could gleam of my future experience at the Magic Castle. A grab bag of reviews, though largely positive, I went in with an open mind. Now let me preface this review by saying that I love magic; from childhood to adulthood, there have been few things that have remained a fascination to me.Anyway, we arrived around 6 pm on a Saturday night. The valet, which is mandatory, was about 4 cars deep, and within minutes we were out of our car and waiting in line to enter. Not quite sure what type of passes we had, but we didn't have to pay the $30/guest entrance fee which was a nice surprise. The mansion itself is amazing, with many different rooms to explore and a lot of magic-related eye candy decorating the walls. Most important of all, however, is the plethora of bars throughout the structure. I'm fairly sure that throughout our night we patronized 3 of them, though it may have been a 'magical illusion' (i.e. the night is a bit fuzzy). The prices are what one would expect from a Hollywood venue, ranging from $12-$14 per drink, though the appetizer portions (which you can order at most bars) are well sized. The ambiance is great, the acts are all highly entertaining, and the service was on point.Overall a great experience I hope to repeat.N.B. Though the drink prices were certainly up there, each and every bartender I spoke to was very receptive to what I ordered. If you want your drink on the strong side, just say so.",5 star rating

We arrived, got seated and started off with the cocktails. For appetizers we all shared a little bit of ... three cheese garlic breads , portobello fries with spicy ponzu sauce (my favorite), crispy calamari, ahi tuna tartare, lobster bisque (average), lobster mac and cheese(I expected better due to the reviews, it was a bit flavorless) and caesar salad....wow... we were about full and here comes our main course: my sea bass was bad, it was dry and bland. My friend's NY strip steak was juicy, the rack of lamb was delicious, and the roasted prime rib was just perfect but unfortunately we had to take half to go because we were so stuffed. Off we go to see the Magic. I'm sorry by now I had a good buzz and the first show in the main theater was the greatest, funny rhymes, jokes, and magic. It went on for an hour and then we headed downstairs for close up magic, the room holds about 20 people. Very cool we got out of there and ordered more drinks and discuss for 30 mins how those quarters disappeared under the cards ""magic""!!! We most likely be back to see the different shows and magic.

Well, that makes things easier. I told him you might not be interested.""__________________________And just like that, the plans were set to visit Magic Castle during my Los Angeles trip. At first my interest stemmed from my love for ""Arrested Development."" Katie W. shares my affection for all things Bluth-related and she also knows about LA, so during one of our dates she insisted I go.Flash forward to the first Monday of my trip. Apparently many of the member magicians attend the shows on Monday. The idea of the magicians playing for their peers sounded appealing and it turned out to be a fabulous night of shows. Since it was my first time there I had to say ""Open Sesame"" to the owl in the bookcase. Then, like magic, the walls opened and we gained entry.  The shows were fun and I got to participate in the first one we attended where Jheff (with an ""H"") controlled my mind.We took a break for dinner before the next two shows. Also, tickets for the main show are only available if you eat there... or if you're an associate member. Fortunately, I was there with an associate member, so dinner was just another nice part of my night.Table service was fantastic, although I wish there was a little more communication with the bar because our drinks seemed to take a while. I had the lamb and it's served with delicious, fresh and crispy vegetables.  We also ordered the lobster macaroni a la carte, which was one of my favorite parts of the meal.The castle itself is impressive and it seems to go on forever... room after room and floor after floor. While downstairs listening to Invisible Irma play my requests I realized Katie Holmes was right across from me. Of course, we didn't speak, but nonetheless it was kind of cool.  There were enough good looking people without the celeb sighting to fulfill my eye candy  needs.

1632,6/15/2008,"Our group of 6 came in around 7:30pm. We payed $10 for Valet parking.The places opens at 5pm. Paid $25 admission per person. It was a pretty upscale place. All the men were dressed in suits and most of the women were in nice dresses, sipping cocktails by the bars. There were many levels, so I can see how you can get lost and confused at first. I felt like I was in an oldies movie when I first walked in there.The Close Up Gallery was okay. This guy did some magic tricks with cards for about 45 minutes. We walked around to Hat n Hare where this bartender was doing magic tricks with more cards. It was okay. I just didn't like the waiting around for shows. There's always ppl crowding around, so it's hard to see.We had dinner reservations at 9:30pm. After reading many reviews on here, I was wary about the food, and stayed away from most of the steaks. Everything I had turned out really good though. I had the ribeye steak ($38) and lobster tail ($22) and lobster bisque ($7) and they all turned out really good. My friend's Milton Steak (~29) was kind of dry. Another friend had chicken, and it was not seasoned enough. The calamari ($11) was good. The garlic bread ($6) was good, I mean, how can you go wrong with garlic bread?The crab dip was decent, and so were the steak tips. But I wasn't too crazy for them. For dessert, try the chocolate souffle, it was soooo moise and soft. I loved it. I also had the creme brulee. All desserts are $9.  There are bars everywhere you go, and you're allowed to carry your drink whereever you go. After dinner, we had tickets to go to the main show at 11:15pm. It was the best! We saw 3 performers, and 2 of them were awesome, especially this one female magician. I think the suckiest thing about this place is that they don't allow any pictures at all whatsoever. I was most disappointed about this b/c we were all dressed up and it was such a nice place inside. But there is this man walking around with a camera. I heard he charges $20 for a photo, but it comes with a guest pass. I managed to sneak some photos with my iPhone though.Overall, I have Magic Castle 4/5 stars b/c I didn't like the waiting around for shows. Before each show, we would have to wait at least 30 minutes to go in and get a good seat. So if you go there, you should arrive at 5pm, catch the earliest dinner possible, so you can watch more shows. If you want to have a good time, then just have low expectations and don't get too excited. :)",4 star rating
1633,6/1/2013,"I came here with a group of 6 for an outing.  The only way that you can get into the Magic Castle is if you are a member or a member placed you on the guest list.  It is valet parking and since I came with a member I paid $10.  Not sure what valet price is when you are a guest coming without the member.  For those who are coming as a guest of a member or a magician there is a $20 door fee and you must have a dinner reservation.  (If coming with a member you can skip the dinner.)  They are really strict about the dress code here so if you plan on coming, make sure to follow the dress code or else you will not be able to get it.  I noticed they were strict with the men about the button down suit jackets but for the girls, the dress length varied and did not have to be knee length.The shows were great, we only were able to see one 20 minute show and caught another show from the director of the board of trustees.  He was really funny and had some awesome card tricks.  I loved how he incorporated everyone in the room into his different tricks.  Gave us a great show and great laughs.  If you come here, be sure to visit the piano to ask Irma to play a song for you.  Trust me you'll be amazed and will enjoy it so I won't tell you what to expect.  Also, upstairs after you walk pass the dinning area to watch the shows, there is a phone booth that you must enter and experience it.The individuals working the valets were great.  Wonderful customer service.  They opened all the doors for my party to get out of the car and greeted us with smiles and very friendly.  They were also very helpful because one member of my party had a zipper jacket rather than a button suit jacket, but helped us out by informing us the people inside can help us out.  When we entered to wait for our party, one of the workers was not very nice.  We informed her we were guest of the member in our party and that the valet had informed us we can ask her for a jacket.  She right away gave us an attitude and said harshly that they had ran out of coats and for us to go home and grab one.  We informed her we lived no where close to home and she told us to go buy one and come back.  She continue to use harsh hand movements to inform us that they were completely out of men's button jacket and we must have one in order to enter.  She than continue to say all they had were some kids jackets and ignored us after wards.  Finally when our member of Magic Castle arrived shortly after us and had a talk with the lady who was rude with us, she magically found a jacket for us.  We didn't realize it at the time, but as we were in the car heading home we realized this place is 21 and over, so why do you have kids jackets?  Didn't make sense.  It only took one person at the front desk to give us a bad taste, but otherwise the other workers at the front desk were nice and didn't talk to us so rudely. Besides the one downfall of the night, I'm glad I was able to experience this place at least once in my life time.",3 star rating
1634,8/1/2007,"I was invited to go and my experience was very unique to say the least. The food here is horrible, of course I was warned about that by many people already. They serve Sizzler food for high end restaurant prices, good thing I wasn't the one paying. I though ordering the garlic bread was a safe bet as an appetizer, what I got was burnt bread with garlic butter. Oh how I wished for the garlic bread at Smoke House! As my meal I got the Wild Salmon; dried out piece of crap. I had to keep dipping it in my sauce to get moist.  The dessert, a molten chocolate cake, tasted like it came from microwave. $100 later for a meal for 2; once again I am glad I wasn't the one paying.But after all we came for Magic right, well for a Wed night it was crowded. Yet I won't review the magic as the shows and entertainers change too much. I just felt I was in an unkempt museum. To think my hero Cary Grant use to love this place, I wonder what he would think seeing it's current condition.",1 star rating
1635,2/20/2010,"Disclosure: Regardless of what this review says, I had a wonderful time on my birthday and I loved spending every moment with my friends. That said..... I was SOO excited to visit this exclusive castle of magic, but I left with mixed feelings about this place. Let me preface this by saying I had to pay a $25 cover and spend $15-20 on food (mandatory) because I came on a member guest pass. So...whenever a cover is paid expectations are through the roof! The staff was friendly, coat check was free so those are two huge positives. The password you say to the owl to enter the building adds to the ambiance of the castle, it was one of my favorite parts. (i know, I'm easily entertained). Driving up to the castle is enough to take your breath away. How does this castle sitting in the middle of Hollywood remain so perfectly hidden???? The castle was extremely busy and it feels very cramped inside. I think they were also having some plumbing issues...there were some leaky ceilings and funky smells at times. The ceilings are low and the spaces are tight. We got used to this after a while. The place was crawling with men...older men....older magical men.... (a good place to prowl for a sugar daddy). So, it was slightly odd at times, to look around and not see any women near bye. (except the ones in my party). I would have to say the worst part of the evening was dinner - Our waiter was very nice and they sang happy birthday to me, BUT - We arrived promptly for our 930pm seating and we were not seated until 9:50, we were rushed through paying the bill in order make the dinner magic show and the entree meals that were ordered were not very good. My friends didn't even have time to order dessert... and It's just okay food. It did the job of making my hunger pains go away but that's about it. The best part of the evening was the closeup performances by the visiting Vegas magicians in the Hat & Hare pub. Seeing magic in an intimate setting with extremely skilled magicians was very fun! We were able to interact with them and ooh and aww as they continued to amaze us trick after trick. Main show with Mr. Ice and Mystina! The main show was full of glitz,, glamour and all that jazz! It was cheesy, but I laughed and I loved it. The best part was the wonderful and very flexible Mystina! I also liked Ice, (the best part was his outfit, he was dressed like Prince!). My tips if you plan to visit - - come early, take the time to walk around the castle and see the different shows. - Or, have the 8pm dinner seating and then take the time to see the late shows afterwards. -You don't have to be as dressed up at they say...i felt slightly overdressed. - Bring a flask, drinks are pricey. The castle is still subject to Hollywood drink $$ - Avoid ordering an entree...stick with the appetizers - Avoid the lobster bisque and the mac & cheese. I didn't see any cheese. - If you must eat dinner, fill up on bread!!! I would love to go back..... but without the $25 cover and the mandatory dinner.",3 star rating
1636,10/5/2015,"My first visit to The Magic Castle was this past Saturday. I've heard countless times how amazing it was so I was very excited to experience all it had to offer. We had dinner and the food was okay. Not bad by any means but certainly not worth the cost. After dinner, we went downstairs to see one of the shows and got priority seating because dinner included one show ticket. The show was entertaining enough. After that show, it was virtually impossible to get in to see any other shows. It was go crowed and you had to wait in line for almost one hour to get to see anything. In an effort to be a good sport, my family and I waited in line for about 45 minutes to see a second show. I'm so sorry to say it was not worth the wait. All in all, we spent hundreds of dollars, saw only two shows and had to squeeze through hall ways and bar areas.  In my opinion, it was simply not worth it :(",2 star rating

It happened to be young adults night - basically bring your family day. The wait was ridiculous. When you went into one of the magic room, the person the magician picked to help could see the way he performed his trick. It was alright. My first impression wasn't that great, maybe a second time will change my mind.Revised - been here a few more time after and I have to admit I like it here. It's like a different world.",4 star rating
1640,8/18/2009,"Just the name itself is intriguing:  A castle full of magic! A bona fide CASTLE! That's MAGICAL! If that doesn't instill some sort of excitement, I don't know what else does.Although I was super stoked for a night of ""guess how these guys are deceiving us like idiots"" entertainment, my boyfriend (of nearly 3 years) decided to tell me the day before that his (dreaded) parents would be attending as well (of whom I would be meeting for the first time). This was not good news (to be diplomatic). Thank goodness for the full bars sprinkled throughout the maze-like building! We were given pamphlets bearing show schedules and map of the property, which was pretty useless. The map, I mean. It was this crude sketch that made little dimensional sense unless careful scrutiny was applied. Either that , or I was drunk. The magic was so much fun, even though I spent more time trying to crack the tricks rather than actually enjoying the show. It is fake, after all. It's a show based on lies! Dinner was decent, but the dining room was so dimly lit my contacts would stick to my eyeballs when I tried to focus. Not that I'm complaining, it only meant it was easier to avoid eye contact with the parents!It's like Disneyland; you gotta visit at least once especially if you live in LA!",5 star rating
1641,7/15/2015,"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!  While there are one or two good points (the building, the dress code, and, for the most part, the magic) the rest of our experience was HORRIBLE!!!  It took me time to calm down to write this review.You would expect that after paying $13 for valet parking and over $150 in door charges for our group just to get in, that you might find some kind of ""class"" in what is billed as a ""private club""...NO SUCH LUCK!THE STAFF AND MANAGERS ARE RUDE, CONDESCENDING, and ARROGANT! One of the ladies in our party is expecting (it's obvious) and she needed to step out of line to use the restroom (expecting mothers need to do this more often than most).  The ""manager""- his name was Ethan/Ethad...something like that- told her that if she left the line that she couldn't get back in because they don't allow people to hold places in line.  We tried to explain that she's expecting and needed the restroom, but he didn't care.  All he wanted to do was talk down to us as if we were children lying to our parents about breaking a lamp!  HE WAS VERY RUDE!  Unfortunately we had to deal with him later when we were trying to be seated for another show.  He said that we wouldn't all be able to sit together and, after telling him that was fine, he looked at our expecting friend and said VERY SNIDELY that she wouldn't be able to leave to use the restroom once she was seated.  WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?!?!?!  HE MUST BE RELATED TO SOMEONE TO BE A ""MANGER"" BECAUSE HE HASN'T LEARNED THAT  IT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAY- IT'S HOW YOU SAY IT!  He was on an ego trip- his condescending tone and snide attitude were impossible to miss.So, onto the food and dinner review:  After paying to get in, you are required to buy dinner. The food is over priced, the quality is poor, and the service was less than terrible.  I ordered the chicken which was so dry, eating paper would have been better.  When I complained to the waiter about the food, I was told that it was all prepared the same and everyone else who orders it likes it; I assume he meant other tables, because I was the only one at ours who ordered the chicken.  Two of the steaks that were ordered had to be sent back because they weren't cooked the way they were ordered and, when they were brought back, they were over cooked and dry!  When we asked for something else, we were told that it would take too long, that we'd miss the show we get tickets for, and they had to set up for the next dinner seating.  When we said that the meals weren't edible because of the way they were cooked, we were told that if we didn't pay for them, we would get tickets to the show.  We asked for the restaurant manager who, conveniently, wasn't available. Our waiter was RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL!!!When we were leaving, I asked the young lady at the front desk for the name and number of the owner.  She gave me the phone number for Joe who, she said, was the General Manger but wasn't in that night.  It figures.I called and spoke with Joe the next day.  HE WAS JUST AS BAD.  Instead of apologizing for what we experienced, HE TRIED TO JUSTIFY IT!  He told me it's their policy not to allow people to hold places in line and that whoever the manager was ""Never spoke to you that way!""  Basically, he called me a liar.  He also told me that since he's been in charge we're the only group that has ever complained about the food or service- I KNOW THAT CAN'T BE CORRECT!!!He offered no apology for the way we were spoken to or treated!  If he really is the General Manger, and he's the one in charge, I know why we were treated so poorly!!!SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  Have a nice dinner at Outback, Black Angus, or other restaurant and get tickets to see a show at The Pasadena Playhouse, Pantages, or other live show.Unless you enjoy bad food and rude service- STAY AWAY FROM THE MAGIC CASTLE!!!",1 star rating
1642,6/19/2011,"Just went this past Thursday . got there early 6ish.. $20 door charge, it's Hollywood there's always a cover even with tickets. Couldn't sweet talk our way in cuz it was two girls working the door :(Walked around since we didn't really know what to do/how it worked. A lot of small bars and lounging areas. Drinks were around $10. First show started at 7:00 but it was too crowded so we waited for the one at 7:30. FRONT ROW SEATING woot. The smaller shows I'm guessing are all around 20-30 minutes long.THEEEN we had dinner reservations at 8. ""ONE ENTRÉE PER PERSON""at the bottom of the menu. But you CAAAAN get a side/appetizer. Sides/Appetizers normal price $10-20, entrées were pricier like 25 - 40 and small portions but overall each was satisfying but nothing too special. OH but their BREAD was delicious. I never usually eat the bread cuz its SUCH a waste of your stomach space, but theirs was so FRESH and SWEET tasting and the butter so FLUFFY I actually ate a whole roll.I'm being more detailed about the food bc (I love food) as I was trying to think of what to order, the other yelp reviews did not have much on food (cuz its more about the magic then food i know) so it took me a while to think of what to order. But here we go! tried the below:Salmon with risotto and artichoke - a good sized portion but a little dry Rack of lamb - a suggestion from our server - with risotto and veggies. Veggies were bland and still a little rawRosemary chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach - very lemony/zesty but iii liked it (others not as much) but tiny like the size of a quailPenne with shrimp - good portion lots of tomatoenessLobster mac & cheese - wanted some sriacha to flavor it upCorn ravioli - didn't try this one, they only gave 3 tiny pieces hahaOnion rings - yummy dipping sauceNow I forgot I didn't even order dessert. Heard the crème brulee was good too DARN. but IN conclusion of the food, i'd rather have skipped it and ate quick cheap bar food. it's not worth the price and wait.. took 2 hours of our night away from shows. I'm guessing since we had dinner, they gave us tickets to the main show (tickets are just to get seated earlier) for the 10oclock. The host was the BEST performer of the night his name was Justin Willman, super funny, definite crowd pleaser. Main show was about an hour long.And then we caught our last show at 11:30. Wish we went on a weekend since theres more shows  I think it's open until 2 on the weekends. OH! And if you want to come back again, they sell photos for 20 bucks and you get a ticket to come back for up to 8 people. PRETTY WORTH IT. Luckily my friends BF bought one. SO we'll be back again, riiiiiight MO & JAVI :)",4 star rating

The castle is best experienced with a group of friends.The setting is awesome, it feels like an actual castle with it's wildly ornate decor and hidden paths, the shows are funny and entertaining and a little dirty which is awesome but...The food is horrible. For the prices they charge it's really very very bad. I do realize that food isn't the reason people come, but since we've always come with the dinner package (I think you can bypass the food for a different package) I have to include it in my review and it's never been worth the cost.

1647,3/16/2010,"The Magic Castle is a club for magicians that is housed in a beautiful and mysterious old mansion just off Hollywood Blvd. We checked in at the lobby and immediately started touring the house. There are 5 levels, 6 bars, and tons of little parlors, theaters, and spaces where impromptu and scheduled performances were going on. We grabbed drinks at the adorable and historic Owl Bar, and walked around. We saw the ghostly piano player, Irma, and were just in time to catch front row for a show at the Parlor of Prestidigitation. Awesome! Listened to an old timey magician do slight of hand tricks and talk about his Old Hollywood war stories. There was something going on everywhere and everyone was festive in floorlength gowns, vintage cocktail attire, towering heels, and jackets and ties for the gentlemen (top hats optional.) Very fun, glamorous, and funky, and so much to look at everywhere we went!Caught an illusionist's show at the Palace Bar, while sipping cocktails. We did dinner in one of the dining rooms, which was basic but very good. I had the lobster mac and cheese and my partner did the NY Strip with a lobster tail on the side for me. Gotta love it. More drinks and then it was time for the big show at the Palace of Mystery. We queued up, got great seats, and let the show begin. There were three magicians, including a ventriloquist which was a little freaky but neat. I actually liked the MC the best, a cool old-school carnival veteran who was very very funny and full of great stories. Before we knew it the show was over - we caught one last mini-show before heading to the Hat and Hare downstairs pub for the very last show. Met some guys down there who gave us their cards and invited us back (The Magic Castle is technically a private club and all guests need to stay at the hotel or be invited/sponsored by a magician member.) Sat in Irma the piano playing ghost's parlor while we finished our last drinks and then headed out.  Evenings don't get much better than this!",5 star rating
1648,6/20/2009,"There are so many things to be said about the Magic Castle...Magical, Great Entertainment, beautiful house and grand atmosphere and the food ain't too bad either.I have to preface this review by saying I'm a member of the Magic Castle and please accept the fact that I'm a bit biased but I will do my best to be very fair.  In the 46 years that the Castle has been, I think that now is the best of times for the old girl.  It is good to get dressed for dinner and to enjoy a night of entertainment that you can not find anywhere else in Hollywood nay even the world on the regular basis that you can at the Magic Castle.Depending on  your point of view, the food has greatly improved over the last year and the prices have stayed about the same so the value for what you get overall is great.  While I believe that everything is very good on the menu, I will always suggest the Steak Milton and the Beef Wellington; potato and veggies come with the meal and the house bread is wonderful.For appetizers the Lobster Bisque is Divine and the crab cakes are pretty good too.  Because the popularity of the place has seemed to increase over the last few years, it is very difficult to get through the meal and still get one of the heavenly deserts before you need to be at the main show.This is a great place to bring guests but I would recommend that small groups of 6 work best to ""see everything"".Be sure to see Irma in the piano bar.  She will entertain you will music of your choosing just be sure to bring a few dollar bills to feed her bird.She also will answer all your questions, just be sure to know  your music because she answers  you musically.Please be sure to enjoy a night at the Magic Castle.  Remember that if you go to the castle it is a very elegant place.  Dress to the nines.  Be respectful of our rules, but most importantly have fun.  Also remember that kids can come on Sunday for a wonderful Brunch and some great magic just for the kids.",5 star rating
1649,4/8/2009,"Ive always seen the castle on top of the hill on franklin, and I had heard of the magic castle, but I never knew that that was THE magic castle...I got to know one of the magicians who performs here, so he was able to get in a large group of mutual friends for a birthday party, all comped (which is a great thing cuz this place can get a bit pricey). When I heard that I had to wear a suit I wasnt to happy about it, but it gave me a reason to finally update my high school prom suit to a grown man suit. The place doesnt look that big on the outside, but damn if its not on the inside. there are some many doors and rooms to go in and out of, its an architectual marvel. We ate dinner and drank at the bar by the entrance first, and listened to this piano playing (but no one, that you can actually see at least, is playing it)  but if you say the name of the song (some songs the piano cant play... mostly hip hop songs lol), the piano starts play it. pretty coolI saw one magician there that to this day i am still stunned by what he did. First off when he walked into the room that he was performing in, he wasnt looking at anthing, just straight ahead the whole time (he did this during his routine as well). He felt his was around and sat down. He was doing some INSANE card tricks that i had never seen before... but get this... he never once looked down at the cards... not once in his 30-40 minute set. he just looked straight ahead. So about 30 minutes later, im at the bar and once again i see this man. he is by himself and bumps into a few people as he gets to the bar... he orders a drink (and pretending that i am not watching) I see him struggling to find the pen on the bar table to sign his receipt (that is literally right next to his hand) and watch him sign his credit card slip upside down (no one else sees this.. I am the only one who is watching, so I know hes not putting on an act or show). And then it suddenly dawns on me... THIS MAN IS BLIND... HE WAS DOING THOSE MAGIC TRICKS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SEE THE CARDS... now if that doesn't blow your mind then go order a ham sandwhich and take a nap, because that's just to much for you to handle.",5 star rating

Old money who doesn't care that it's dirty and ridiculous.  The sign ""pardon the dust"" when we walked into the dining room made me ask, ""why not just...dust the dining hall?"" but they weren't worried about having class, so it's ok.C.) the magicians were horrible.  and i hate saying that because i know one of them, and he's really really good.  but i guess a lot of them are terrible.  The first table we sat at was an old man in a 10 gallon hat who screwed up  half his tricks.  good thing he had fall backs for all his tricks in case they go wrong.  i wish i wasn't afraid to say things like, ""the dollar was in your pocket the whole time, it's not the same dollar"" or ""thats not even the same size as the crumpled piece of paper i gave you"". C.) cont. The big ""show"" was horrible too.  the assistant was hot, but trashy hot.  and the magician did some pretty bad tricks.  once you even saw him stuff the fake bird in his mouth.  like...the joke was that it wasn't a trick...which woulda been a fine trick, except that it was his big finale.  The opening act was twice as good as the headliner, except their music was bad electro from the 80's and i would guess their act hasn't changed since then either.C.) cont. oh, can't forget this one.  The headliner blows up a 5 foot balloon,  makes a half dozen penis jokes because the balloon is flesh colored, then continues to DEEP THROAT the 5 foot fake penis-balloon, which took him about 3 minutes to fake swallow, giving the 60+ year old crowd plenty of time to make inappropriate jokes about he needs to give lessons to their much younger wives.oh, and the ghost piano that plays any song you call out?  has no one heard of MIDI?  i could do that in my home too, all i need is someone sitting in my closet with a computer listening to everything we said by the piano.So, after all that, it probably could have been a fun time!!! don't make us eat dinner, don't  make it an ""exclusive invite only"" club.  open up the bar, let us enjoy a drink and a show without forcing us to pay 20 bucks to get in and spend 50 on dinner.  and maybe, it'd be cool again.for the record, there was one really cool magician. he was the only one under 30 though.  he told good jokes, did really good card tricks.  i give him 5 stars.",1 star rating

I've only experienced MC during the night time.MUST DO! { 5 brilliant+magical stars !!! }- Come early! Magic Castle doors open at 5:30pm. Take advantage of this magical getaway! My goal is to see all the shows they offer! It's possible...- Dinner Reservation: Reservations for dinner is required for those with guest passes. I'd advise to get the earliest seating at 6pm. Come at 5:30pm, relax at the bar until dinner. So after dinner, you are free to roam and watch any of the shows.- Magician John George: A favorite of mine! Seen him a couple times at the Close-up Gallery and always leaves me wanting more. There's cards, there's balls, there's even mind-blowing bending forks. (He's actually performing now through March 20!) - Close-up Gallery (small/intimate room): WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T MISS the shows at the Close-up Gallery. My favorite room in the castle. Max seating of just 22 people, this theater provides an intimate setting where sleight-of-hand magicians will perform jaw-dropping tricks and leave you wide-eyed and baffled. On a weekend, this gallery fills up quickly, so get there at least 45 minutes early to guarantee good front row seating. Nothing beats sitting front row, mid section, inches away from the magician and his tricks. Good luck figuring it out!! - Parlour of Prestidigitation (mid-size room): Think David Blaine or Criss Angel--TRIPPY!!. The magicians that perform here are always a mind-blowing trip. One time my brother and I got selected to help with a set and I STILL have no idea how he did it. These are REAL card/mind tricks, using REAL people. Magicians in this room typically perform more ""parlour"" and ""cabaret-style"" acts.- Palace of Mystery (large-size room): Think David Copperfield and Vegas-style acts. This room typically performs more stage magic and grand illusions. With dinner reservations, seating is guaranteed with a ticket.- If there's downtime in between shows/acts, explore around the many levels of the castle. Venture into the dungeon/basement area to see free-style magic acts and interact one-on-one with magicians!Food { 3 stars rating }I gotta admit, the food isn't up to par to the price. But then again, you don't come to Magic Castle for the food...Highlights: Crispy Calamari, Magic Castle Chili (an LA Times award-winning concoction, it comes with all the fixings), Pan-seared Salmon.Service { 4 stars rating }Whether it's the servers at the dining area or the ushers at the parlours, service is great. Attentive, cordial and answers questions. Don't Forget !- Admission is $20/person (depending in the type of invite)- Strict dress code. Think coat & tie for men and evening dress for women. No tennis shoes, for reals. One time our friend didn't bring a coat jacket, so he has to borrow a MC loaner. Don't embarrass yourself by sticking out like a sore thumb, read the dress code rules!Boys, if you get an invitation, bring your lady here! Girls Dig Magic !",4 star rating
1654,7/26/2013,"I was lucky to tag along with a friend who received an invitation from a member. We had a party of 6 and attended Sunday brunch. Right off I was a little put off by the amount of people who were allowed into the place even through they were not dressed according to the dress code. The line for brunch was really long, but once you entered the room where the food was set up this makes sense. The room could probably only hold 10 people comfortably. Aside from these two issues, the food was good and the magic even better. The highlight of our trip was a drink we had at the bar. It was a really cool place to visit once, but not enough for me to spend that kind of money to return again.",3 star rating
1655,2/17/2011,"Yes, as good as it gets. I can say without a doubt Magic Castle is by far one of the classiest and most prestigious institutions I've had the honor of being a member of.Magic Castle is not your ordinary ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" kinda place. It's a world renouned Magician's institute with over 5000 magicians in it's ranks. Serious business.On any given night there are roughly 10 official magic shows on rotation, all held in different theaters inside the Castle. These range from normal close-up magic with playing cards to more elaborate tricks. The flashier shows are held in the larger theaters. If you find yourself unable to get into any shows you can always find random magicians posted next to the bars that give smaller intimate shows, which at times I find are actually more enjoyable.My suggestion is when you enter grab a program and explore a little first.  Locate the earliest showtime and get in line as some of the theaters only hold 15-20 people. The larger ones are more popular and hold more guests however I've noticed these also tend to fill up the quickest.If you eat dinner here, you are given ""tickets"" to each magic performance. These tickets allow you to cut through the line and have priority seating. Everyone else must wait in the stand-by line. If you are in stand-by it's best to observe how many people are ahead of you. If you see yourself at the end of a long line, it's best to return for a later show as i've waited in the past for an hour before being told to take a hike.MC is also a magic museum. Take notice of all the posters and items encased in the walls as some of these items hold historical significance. Downstairs in the very bottom of the Castle for example they recently received W.C.Fields' personal pool table donated by the family. The castle also has trick doors and hidden passages if you're lucky to stumble upon them. A friend of mine recently had an encounter with a skeleton inside a phonebooth. If you see this phonebooth, you've been warned.Dress code is extremely strict. Men suit and tie, women I guess they're a bit more relaxed as I've noticed many hoochie mamas prowling around here lately.Weekends are typically the busiest. Wednesdays are the quietest and best day to go......and if you see me say hello! I'll be here auditioning to become a fellow magician here soon.",5 star rating
1656,4/26/2011,"OPEN SESAME! when you start the night out talking to a red-eyed owl who magically opens a book case, you know it's gonna be interesting. Perched on a hillside, magic castle is an exclusive members only hollywood legend, where talented magicians come to entertain! We came on 4/25/11 on the opening night of Japan Week - a week of magic featuring magicians from Japan! Mix japanese pop culture with magic and a 99 lb man with mechanical doves, and you are sure to have a great night! Luckily, we had a hook up that waved our $20 cover. Even if we had had to pay, it was a great way to spend a bday dinner amongst friends! I would definitely recommend coming with a group and tryin to sit in front so you can participate with the shows.Valet is $8, not bad for hollywood and for such a shi shi exclusive place.Dinner upstairs was surprisingly good for it being a showcase kind of place. The prime rib was tender, plentiful, and when dipped in the au jus, perfect tasting. The mashed potatoes and veggies also were particularly yumm. Food was good and not so overpriced that you'd be shocked and dismayed. The layout of the castle is a little confusing, but adds to the almost-haunted-mansion feel of the entire night. Didn't find any of those magical hallways that people were talking about, but did see some photos with moving eyeballs or two sets of eyes. Would definitely come back for a special occasion, but would't hang out at the bar as a regular... that's a little too interesting...",4 star rating

1658,9/30/2013,"Interspersed among the raves are occasional dud reviews, and you'll find a common theme: the rude staff, and alas, this is true. There is among the Magic Castle staff a pervasive attitude that they are doing you a great favor letting you in. This extends all the way to top management.Staff aside: We took an elderly friend to celebrate her birthday, and she was thrilled. The food was excellent, and the magicians and their performances were  uniformly great.Look past the staff and their attitudes, and you'll have a fine evening.",3 star rating
1659,3/18/2012,"If you can get in to the Magic Castle--you need to go. Behind the sliding bookcases, passwords, and phantom piano players lies a real Los Angeles treat. I honestly couldn't describe the Castle without doing it injustice. I'll give you the highlights: -Delicious food & strong drinks-Unlike anywhere I've ever been, or am likely to go-Great after dinner show (get tickets if you can)-Eating dinner adjacent to Neil Patrick Harris-Everyone dresses to the nines, it's requiredWhat. A. Great. Time.",4 star rating
1660,6/23/2010,"I can't believe I lived in LA for 10 years and never knew about this place. Suffice to say, when a friend told me he was a member and insisted I go, I discovered a really fun little world tucked up there on Franklin Street. Over the past 2 years I have tried all the various dining options: Lunch on Friday, Saturday night dinner, weekday dinner, Sunday Brunch and the Harry Houdini Seance. However, my favorite time to go is Saturday night. So that is when I suggest you go, on Saturday night. Here's some tips from my experience in order to have a good time. First, make sure to go early and eat the early dinner. This is so you can enjoy everything the castle has to offer and there is a lot. In fact, I am finding new stuff all the time. If you eat at the later setting you are going to feel rushed and you probably won't get to see everything. So make the most out of your trip and go early. I suggest making a plan of attack prior to showing up (via the website schedule) or right when you get there and are handed a schedule. Make sure to look at the schedule so you can try and make as many shows as possible. Each show has a different amount of seats in the room ranging from 20 to about 150. So if you don't get to the shows early they fill up and thus you get disappointed. Another reason you want to go early is because they have a lot of nook and crannies and also a ton of cool bars. You want to make sure you go check out these bars as this is where magicians linger so you meet some cool guys. You want to check out Erma too. She's fun. I go on Saturday nights because that is usually when the coolest magicians are there. Make sure to walk up and down the corridors because there are little secret places all over the castle and magicians are lingering wanting to show people tricks. I can say with confidence to skip the Sunday Brunch unless you have kids. Sunday Brunch caters to the kid friendly audience which is cool if you are a family. Also, I don't think they have as good as food at brunch as they do at dinner. Speaking of dinner, the Magic Castle is known as a steak house so order the steak and order the fish. Veggie people, I am sorry, but the veggie friends who have gone with me have not enjoyed their veggie meals so order some appetizers. The Harry Houdini Seance is fun to do with a group but I must admit the motorized Disneyland part is kind of cheesy. But the overall experience of the seance is very fun. So go and laugh it off. Magic.....The magic is really awesome in my opinion. Some of the best I have ever seen. I think of all the times I have been there I have only seen two things that were a little cheesy. The other times I am amazed and constantly wondering ""how the heck they did that!"" The most amazing magician I have seen is Harry Turner, a blind man who does some mean card tricks. I have noticed some people complain about the magic and all I can say to them is... It's a Magic Castle people, if you don't like magic or find magic cheesy don't go. Is the visit pricey and do you have to follow a dress code? Yes, you will drop cash at this place so plan accordingly. Yes, read their website before you go and follow the rules cuz it's a club and they will enforce them. Most of all...have fun!! There is lots of fun to be had at the Magic Castle! So get dressed up and go with a bunch of friends. And get your cocktail on!",5 star rating
1661,3/18/2012,"Definitely worth going once but not twice. The food is overpriced but good. The shows are good but not great. I know it's cool to dress up once in a while and have a nice evening out but seriously I don't know if watching a guy link a couple of metal rings together and guessing my card warrants a coat and tie. You better make Yamashiro disappear or some other shit for all that.And by the way, Magic Castle, I understand that it's cool and hip to make this place exclusive by invite only and if it was open to everyone then it would be pure pandemonium for such a relatively small place but would it kill you to let people bring in a camera and take a couple of pics? Lame Castle.",4 star rating
1662,1/26/2009,"Let me begin by saying I think that you have to be SERIOUSLY jaded not to appreciate the Magic Castle. I took my mom and dad here for my mother's birthday. I drove up to a castle. Last time I checked it's been a while since I drove up to a castle. I got out of the car and the valet took care of it for me, so I didn't need to worry about parking. The magic was already beginning, and I hadn't even set foot in the castle! When you get inside you are in a small room where you give your guest passes to the hostess (you can't get in unless you know someone in the ""magic community."") This is where I got to say the magic words ""Open Sesame."" The bookcase turns so you can enter the castle. Whoever thought of the secret passage entry is a fantastic genius, I have ALWAYS wanted to open a secret passage like that and I finally got the chance. The decor inside reminds me of Knotts Berry farm, it has an old-west- saloon/brothel feel to it.  My family and I went to go get a drink. We sat down in a room with a ghost piano player named Irma. She will play anything you want on the piano. If you go DO NOT miss Irma, she is a highlight. There are also roaming magicians that walk around the castle all night.  They are fun to interact with. At the magic castle they never let you become bored. We went to dinner. My parents loved it and I thought it was quite good, I was a bit tipsy from the drinks and that always makes food taste ten times better. I got the fillet minion, and I thought it was lovely. Dinner is expensive, but the Magic Castle is a once in a life time opportunity. When you go there you should expect to splurge. We saw all three shows. And they were all excellent. Top-notch performers doing mind-blowing shows. It was great to see my fairly-serious parents in awe of the performers. They were ooohhing and awwing and laughing. Magicians make people feel young again. That alone makes the trip worthwhile. Yes, there are going to be some quirky people there. But you should expect it. People that choose to practice magic for their profession are not exactly mainstream people. They march to the beat of their own drum. Embrace it! Take in the top hats and monacles and mullets; think of them with affection. Get on stage and let them steal your watch, they give it back eventually! This place has endeared it's self to me. Go with an open mind and prepare for it to be blown.",5 star rating
1663,1/22/2009,"I have always wanted to go to the Magic Castle.  I heard it was an experience you have to have in Los Angeles. I would agree that it was an experience.Mullets.  Big, old, boobs squeezed into undersized dresses...bad meat...poor service...and such bad magic.Oh, but at least I got to wait in line and pay a cover charge of $25.00.  To be fair, I think magicians, and I'm generalizing, are weird folk.  I rank dedicated magicians up there with mimes and clowns.  Just bizarre.  I know it takes talent, but I just want to punch em in the face and take their lunch money.  I will say that up until the WORST show I have ever sat through I did have fun with my friends...but I would save a few hundred bucks and go to a nice happy hour instead.",1 star rating

1665,5/2/2010,"Came here for the Sunday Brunch as part of my company's anniversary celebration.  Otherwise, I doubt I would have ever come in since you need to know someone, who knows someone (who has a pass) to get in.They have a formal dress code (jackets & ties for the gents, dresses for the ladies) but the weekend brunch offers more of a relaxed dress code without the coats or neckpieces.  The Venue - 5 starsThe place is huge.  The building was originally built in the early 1900's reflecting the popular Victorian style of the time.  The interior is kind of how I imagined it would be, dark ambiance, lots of exposed wood walls with a ton of pictures, artwork, and other magic themed paraphernalia.  Besides the main stage/room where our performance was to take place, the castle has a ton of other small rooms that have individual acts performing throughout the day.  The dining area on the upstairs level features a number of connected rooms filled with tables, which also feed into the buffet hall.   The Food - 2.5There were the usual brunch suspects: eggs, potatoes, bacon, fruit, omelet bar, french toast, and lox.  They also included a hot meat carving station (turkey & beef) roasted veggies, enchiladas, penne w/ fettuccine, shrimp cocktail and a small tray of desserts.  The food was good, but for what I heard the price was, I doubt I would come back for the food as a paying customer.  Also comes with endless beverages, limited to water, coffee, sodas, juices and mimosas.The Magic - 2.5The afternoon show started at 12:45 and had three acts (can't remember their names) that spanned about 45 minutes.  It was a good mix of talent, as each act had something different to offer that was individually unique.  Crowd participation is encouraged, as 2 of 3 acts brought up ""assistants"" to join their show to partake in action.  Overall, it was a good experience worthy of maybe doing again, albeit you will spend some money here so do come prepared.  I'm not a magic aficionado at any length, though if you are, it is worthwhile to check out.",3 star rating
1666,12/4/2010,"Old world Magic.  Loved it.i love cheesy things like this. Dingy castle with that old world feel. Definitely dated and set back in time- and that's what makes it AWESOME!  It reminds me of the haunted mansion at Disney, a little bit. I've been to the castle three times. Each time, it was amazing. Brunch here, and lunch here was great!So many little secrets with this place, you have to go to learn about them all.

1667,5/15/2010,"Do you believe in magic? I don't! But I went to the magic castle with an open mind and had a GREAT time :)Truly one of a kind place in Hollywood - literally a castle in the middle of LA! As you drive up the winding road to the lit-up castle, you feel like you're stepping into a scene of a fairy tale movie.Everybody is dressed to the max and the crowd is definitely mixed. Old and young, all different ethnicies.. but everybody up for a great night of magic :) Bars are spreadout throughout the castle and there is also a dining room for dinner (we tried to get a reservation on Friday and only avaliable times were 6pm and 945pm). We filled up on appetizers - fried calamari, shrimp cocktail, and beef tartar. What else is really good at the bar is the Pale Moon beer ($7) - one of the most DELICIOUS beers I've ever had! I guess I like them wheat beers :)My date had to feed me because I was whining like crazy about how I was starving - but after we pounded down a few appetizers, we set off to explore the castle and see the shows. Every part of this castle has a trick involved. Talk to the piano - it plays whatever song you want it to. Ask the owl at the bar a question - and he will either nod or shake his head as a response. Step into the phone booth - and find a ghost in your reflection! Yell ""OPEN SESAME"" to the bookcase - and the sliding door will open with your verbal command! FUN in every corner!Unfortunately, magic castle is one of those exclusive hollywood joints - either you have to know a magician or you have to be a member (which costs you an arm and a leg = $6000?) - if you ARE a member, you get in free (w/friends). if you just KNOW a magician or a member, its still $25 for admission!  Everything is WAY overpriced, catty girls, crazy outfits, big spenders, people cutting in line, the cold hollywood stare..  if you can forgive all that, I think magic castle is a great experience to have, at least once!TIPS = No photographs inside; Dress code STRICT: Guys MUST wear jacket/tie or it will be provided. Girls dress up, but definitely more lenient! Drink!!! - makes all the shows more enjoyable! Go early and try to see as many shows as you can! :)",4 star rating
1668,4/26/2008,"How the heck do you not like this place?? It's awesome. It's magical. It's fun.If you like magic, you would love this place. There's a bunch of magic shows all over the castle. Some are scheduled every couple of hours and performed on a stage and others are small shows in every corner of the castle.Definitely, try one of the close-up magic shows and make sure they pick you to do a trick. It's pretty awesome. I got picked for a trick and somehow my driver's license ended up in the magician's wallet. It was weird. These people have fast hands, these tricky magicians. The shows definitely deserve 5 stars. No doubt. But because of the food...overall this place gets 4 stars. The food was not horrible but being a picky little foodie that I am...I must say that it was just edible. But ya know...being at the magic castle and all you have to do the dinner and show thing. I mean...you really have to...you don't have a choice if you get invited. They really push the drinks here which I'm sure no one really minds, right?? I haven't had a good buzz like I did here in awhile so it was a super fun magical night for me. So...is anyone a member or a magician?? Hook me up with an invite so I can go again. :)",4 star rating
1669,6/29/2013,"Magic Castle is a great place let me say that. The magicians drinks are A+. There are just a few things that rubbed me the wrong way. I get it that they need to act the part of it being so prestigious but some of waitstaff are RUDE! When your spending a lot of money on this amazing experience every aspect should be that. Food is way overpriced 27 for a vegan wrap that looks like its from TOGOS??? The busers are rushing and telling you to get out of their way, but its so packed you can't go anywhere. The waitstaff in the dining room were amazing. They walked you to the bathroom super friendly.The REDHEAD DRINK WAITRESS at the 10pm show last night was beyond rude. My friends father who is the nicest guy asked a simple question on how to get to his seats. He didn't want to walk in front of stage. This redhead shoots back and talks like he's slow and says ""all you have to do is walk, have you tried walking!"" it was some sort of rude line. I literally laughed out at the audacity of this girl. I know its crazy waiting on a million people but you are not gonna make any tips if your personality sucks and your rude.

1670,6/21/2008,"Imagine the most complicated, velvet-walled Victorian house in the world, with gorgeous serving girls in lovely dresses handing you cold booze, then slipping behind secret doors.....a nautilus of cocooning rooms in a layout that would give a suburban multiplex a headache of complexity, and in each one? Magicians, more talented than you've ever seen, waiting for you to walk in, sit down, and be entertained...this rococco gingerbread fantasy castle is like Disneyland on mushrooms. It feels like its been here since the 1930's, and you've followed the Yellow Brick Road to real magyck. Whoosh. A false library wall opens to admit you to this fairyland -- that's the first thing you see, and it's Walt Disney recherche fun.Our party heads in, like spelunkers... including Party Girl, Medical Girl, and Famous Chefboy. We had been invited by the enormously talented David Minkin to see him perform...and Pig and P.G. were already excited, for we'd seen him at Beu Rivage, and knew he was the Boy Jesus of Handsleight. We had discretely imbibed herbervorically before arriving and were glad we did, for this place is a mescaline dream from the start to finish, full of pretty people gathered around charming purveyors of the dark arts of cards, mesmeristic coins that appear from nowhere, and the lovely vivid licquers of good mixed drinks, furnished by lovelies. Drink various colored addlepating concoctions and snack on excellent canapes (we didn't eat in the dining rooms, preferring to get in more Magyk, especially since the food gets a bad rap, rep-wise.) The bar canapes were good, in a TGIF way (and Pig likes TGIF food, so there.)Hint -- get there early to see as many shows as you can. We will next time, if we're lucky enough to go again -- you have to be invited.)How many show rooms in this castle? At least six, probably twenty...and men and womyn walk from room to room, speaking of Michelangelo, or actually, of the que to see master micro-close up prestidigitator, David Minkin, in the ""Close Up  Room'. Only 22 make it in for one of four shows of the night...we made it in after a short velvet roped wait spent talking to a lovely young actress with swooped up blonde hair and a pixie face from a 1940's MGM musical--she was the precise symbol of the night, a thick blanket of starlet heaven in short skirts and rosy mists of butterfly muses, along with lovely wishes for artistic fame...speaking of which, and here was the Minkman! Conjuring floating cards four feet from our amazed eyes, or divining water from his palms (rolled up sleeves) causing oos and ahs in the red velvet lined theatricum...the man can make gravity disappear. He was astonishing...But then...the magicians here are the best in the world -- think the Ivy League of sleighters -- this is Mecca for the world's best magykers...they come here to impress each other as well as you...you benefit...apres cadabra...We also saw Patrick, a purposeful, beautifully-suited magician with betwitching card switchery and genuinely funny jokes to mirror the sleight...We saw spectacularly sarcastic, but gentle John holding court at a long bar, making cards do tricks while he beautifully and playfully insulted his audience into hysterical whoops. Party Girl kvelled at how she kept getting picked by the magicians to be worked upon magically... till we had to shut her up with cosmos, vodka gimlets, and duct tape.You wander this place, and each long dark hall leads to light-pooled magyk, men at small tables who will produce doves out of card boxes.Phalanxes of oil paintings of great magicians of the past look down at live magicians drinking while off duty and gossiping with you. They are delightful artists, true performers in their native noir home, one imagines they all float up into space at the end of the night and go to their bedrooms upstairs, like Harry Potter and his classmates at Hogwarts...an imaginarium wrought real...We saw four main acts in various theaters. One of these acts -- one magician - was not good. So, one of four. A goodly exchange rate, we thought. There seemed to be at least ten or twelve a night.Alas, we had to go home having seen only four digicators. Next time we will plan to go early, and see six shows. Visual orgasms are planned.Yes, this old-fashioned Disney-style space is the opposite of hip. But then, hip magic is a contradiction in terms -- one must approach the Magic with childlike wonder, which is never hip, is it? Not if hip means 'fuck you, you're not cool.' Well, I'm not cool, as any friend of Pig can tell you. Pig is a proud dork, and likes child-like wonder.Go to this Globum Mysterisum with some poetry in your soul, and with childlike wonder. Then drink gimlets and inwardly kvell and cavort at the amber lit bars and dens. It's  a true fun thing that can only and ever be done here in Los Angeles, ... And that's another little ray of reason we stay in this cindered city of ash and angels...Magic, fellow puercos.",5 star rating
1671,3/25/2011,"This was an experience! And a very surprising one. My husband was invited to go through his work and lucky me, I got to come.You  have to be a member or invited by a member or something close in order to enter. Let me say that this is a great and unique place to hold a corporate meeting or event. The group had their own room with their own bar. But first, the arrival. The skies were darkened by the rare rain we get in California but it added to the mood. We drove up a small driveway to the valet. Then, opened the door to get inside.Exclusive. Yes. After they confirmed who we were with they had us stand in front of the bookcase and utter the magic word. The bookcase opened and we walked into a different world- decor from the early 1900s, dark deep colors and candles everywhere. We walked into a parlor room,. With a bar. There were side tables were magicians sat doing card tricks. Then we were escorted to our party, passing through hallways lined with pictures and oddities. I could have spent hours looking at the pictures of old Hollywood and Magical legends cavorting in the place. Up some stairs, down some stairs, it was like going through a maze. We got to our first destination. Another bar and more historical pictures. Then we were led to the dining room. A magician entertained while we ate and the service was excellent. Then on to the show!This was the main show but still, it was intimate and ornate. It felt like you had traveled through time and was about to see Houdini take the stage. And, you could even drink during the show. The show was good. and then we decided to see a second show in the parlor, a smaller theater. That show was smaller and excellent. Walking out of  the parlor we noticed a group gathered around a man doing card tricks. We stopped and watched, they were AMAZING. On our way out we got lost, which was a good thing because we found a few more bars and a piano that played by itself. That room had a magical vibe to it.  I also found another few rooms that I want to check out next time and I sincerely hope there is a next time.  That is a HINT to all those who are hooked up. It was a weeknight so we were able to walk through the castle with ease (except for knowing where we were). The staff was very helpful -from the valet to the servers to the bartenders. It is rare to get such a unique experience in Los Angles now adays And if you go, make sure you go to the phone booth. :)",5 star rating
1672,3/28/2012,"I recently experienced the Magic Castle for the very first time for brunch and magic. I thought it was an interesting combo, too. Drinks and magic seemed more fun/ obnoxious. Brunch and magic, however, was just fine. The place is very old school, with cheesy decor. I felt like I was walking around the haunted mansion in Disneyland. I partly think that is what made the place so much fun. For instance a (player) piano played by a ghost; secret doors that aren't so secret, etc. I had such a good time, I'm still contemplating the idea of becoming a member. I think this is something everyone should experience, not because the magic is so fabulous, but because the shows are fun in a laugh out loud corny sort of way. I would love to come back in the evening with friends. I understand there are more magicians in then.In my personal experience, I thought the brunch was a little expensive. I, however, have no regrets. I guess that means I thought it was worth it. If you know a member and can get an invitation, I recommend taking a trip and just to hanging out, with disappearing rabbits and assistants.",5 star rating
1673,7/23/2010,"Pick a card, any card...There's no shortage of men holding decks of cards, shuffling them with offhanded precision.  Jealous?  Well at the end of the night, I definitely had card envy (teehee).The moment I entered the Magic Castle, I instantly loved it.  It has that vintage Victorian-Hollywood feel with its wood paneling, beveled glass, and parlor rooms. There's a zillion pictures, all of magicians in various poses, more than half in cocked-brow benevolence.After the valet took our car ($8) and after a couple of poses in front of the structure (no pictures allowed inside - grrrr!), the first thing Connie, Danielle, Lindsay, and I did in our finest threads (formal attire was mandatory - think cocktail hour) was climb up the stairs to the second floor restaurant.  All four of us had appetizers and sides (you had to order $15 minimum).  I had the sweet corn ravioli and garlic/parmigiana/truffle oil fries.  Delicious!  Some lady next to us had the hugest Prime Rib I had ever seen.  So for all you meat eaters - you won't need to ask ""where's the beef?"".After dinner, we had several choices of shows from a large stadium with a magician who might have had a few stints in Las Vegas to  private shows with meandering magicians.  I have to admit, my favorite were the magicians we randomly bumped into such as Jose, who made Lindsay's ring go from her hand to an unopened envelope, the snarky Cowboy who was incredibly deft with his card and dice tricks.  And lastly, our newest friend, Crow, who allowed us all to participate in all his amazing card tricks.The Magic Castle was such a fun place.  Between shows we walked around, put in our request to Irma, the piano-playing ghost who simultaneously dazzled and freaked us out each time we asked her to play a song (I mean really - what ghost do you know can play Bohemian Rhapsody and  Like A Virgin on a vintage piano?).And to all the party people in the house - Bars everywhere.  I think it was mandatory to be buzzed.  The bummer part of it all was that it's an exclusive club and the only way you can gain access is if you are invited.  So if you get an opportunity, GO.  It will be worth it!",5 star rating

I was taken here for an early Mother's Day by friends (I'm their son's Godmother), I was surprised that you were charged when you walk through the door  ($15 per person) on top of the charge for the brunch. We came by limo so I have no idea what that cost to park! We didn't walk around the castle because we had no idea we could! So, I'm sure we missed a lot of stuff which is too bad.

Brian Gillis was our favorite. My friends signed $20 bill in a SEALED Splenda packet? WTF? Amazeballs! Dinner was pricy. 7 bills for 8 of us but that included a couple bottles of their house champagne which was very tasty and STRONG. :) Came on a Friday night with a 6:00 reservation for dinner and I def recommend getting there early because by 9 the place was packed.

1677,10/17/2015,"I brought my husband here for his birthday because we're nerdy and we like this kind of stuff! I got an invitation from one of the magicians (I emailed him requesting an invitation) who perform here and then made my reservation. Tip: make sure you reserve well in advance because I hear they book up pretty quickly. A trip here can easily break your bank especially because if you're not escorted by a member, you have to pay $13 for valet parking, $30/person entrance fee, and a mandatory dinner reservation (whatever that will cost depending on what you order). Dinner here of course is not cheap. You can expect an entree for $30 on the lower end. However, we like to go big or go home. So we got their special rib eye that was as big as our face, filet mignon, clam chowder, and cheesy bread. I did not have much expectations for their dinner after reading reviews saying that the food is just ok. But I thought the food was fantastic! I was surprised how much I liked it! Only down side is when our waitress asked if we wanted to start off with some cheesy garlic bread, we said yes because it sounded complimentary but it's not. Don't fall for it like us unless you do like cheese bread!",4 star rating
1678,12/16/2010,"Note: This rating is for the shows, venue, and bar service only.  I like magic.  The notion that something can appear out of nothing both scares me and amazes me.  I believe if I think of something really really really hard, like with that special spark inside me, then I can make it happen.  Not like I'm a magician, or that I can do magic, or maybe I can but I don't know how yet... but I know I can influence it.  We can all influence it.  It's pretty cool.  Magic is so cool.  So, I think I should live at the Magic Castle.  I think whoever owns it should let me live there.  Because... I believe there's an enchanted object  there that I'm meant to find and the only way for me to find it is to live there, or have a complimentary lifetime membership so I can discover this spell binding object and open up doors of enchantment in the Magic Castle.  Please, and thank you.  The shows were very, very entertaining.  It wasn't just the booze.  Well, maybe a little.  But the magicians were so personable and charismatic.  I wish they used magic to shrink themselves so I can put them in my pocket and take them with me everywhere.  They were so funny too! I was laughing so hard and the rest of the time I couldn't help but smile.  The kind of smile with a sparkle in my eye because I was so happy.  I sat as close as I could in every show so I could be picked.  They called on me in each show, which made me feel special.  But my fabulous friend, Jenn S. (who received the invite to the castle and took us along for the ride), got picked to go to the front! I was so jealous! She's so lucky I love her so much or I would have pulled her hair because I wanted to get picked so badly.  But, she was an adorable participant.  So... I'll let it go.  UGH. Letting it go... The atmosphere was very fanciful and elegant, and it wasn't as hoity-toity as I was expecting for an invite only venue.  The service and crowd were so friendly and accommodating.  One of the curators even walked us to the upper parlor because we were afraid of getting lost and being late for the show.  At first, I was afraid of having a lot to drink because... well, drunk Crystal isn't always classy Crystal and I didn't want to be shunned by the Magic Castle.  But my tipsy self actually felt really comfortable there.  It really is such an enjoyable place to visit!  I want to go back!P.S.

1683,12/20/2008,"Watch $100 turn into a bad meal right before your eyes!So I read a lot of Yelp reviews before going, which was good, because I knew to order the cheapest thing on the menu and to bring a flask. This is the advice I pass onto you, friendo.My boyfriend and I went with an old friend from out of town on a guest pass. We paid $20 a piece to get in and ate the mandatory dinner. TIP: If you want to order cheap, but not look cheap, act like you're a vegetarian and go with the ""vegetarian special."" The food wasn't terrible. I just got a bowl of lobster bisque and the crab cake appetizer. My friend and my boyfriend got the vegetarian ravioli and a side salad. Drinks were $7-$10, depending on who you ordered from. BUT I got two drinks at one of the various bars, and the bill was $26, so stick with the bar on the main level, if you don't want a surprise ass fucking like that.We were the youngest people by far enjoying the Castle on this particular Thursday, and we're 30, so use that information however you want. I suggest lining up at least 10-15 min before the designated magic shows, which happen in three different rooms, but don't expect anything amazing from these shows. I may be a little more in tune to magic than the average guest, because my boyfriend did magic all through college (and can still do some sexy shit with a deck of cards, if I do say so myself), but the big shows were the most disappointing. There were a few, four to be exact, other magician hanging around in the shadows of the place, doing tricks for whoever sits down, and they were much more impressive. But that's all ""up close"" obviously. The biggest disappointment of the night, talking strictly about the quality of the magic, was when a guy pulled out the ""rope and ring"" trick you can buy at your local magic shop. My boyfriend actually bought this a year ago, and the guys working at the shops do it much better than the guys at the Castle. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW:**You'll spend a lot of money. We each spent over $100/ea, and we all brought small flasks.**Don't expect much from the food. Just don't.**If you like to drink, bring a flask. Even if you aren't cheap like we are, the lines back up enough to where you don't want to deal with it when you can knock out peeing and fixing your drink at the same time.**Doing the 6:00 dinner is good and allows you to see any and all shows and side shows you want to see.**Go around and see all the side magicians. Just sit down with them.**If you want to participate in the shows, sit in the first row. Nothing crazy, but its more fun that way. This means line up outside of the shows early.**Dress up, but there's no need to obsess about looking ridiculously good. It's just not that kind of opportunity, you know?**Most bitches be wearing black, and guys can wear khakis if you want.I will only return WITH A MEMBER, meaning, no entry fee and you can skip dinner.",3 star rating

There's something old and mysterious (creepy) about the place that makes it so intriguing. Just seeing the decor, artifacts, and infrastructure alone is enough to boggle your mind. I can only imagine what the blueprint of this place is like - be careful not to stray from your group because you'll vanish. Good luck!You do have to dress up which is a tad annoying, especially if you eat a big meal here and happen to need fat pants to hold your prime rib up. By the way, prime rib? Pretty damn good if you get it medium rare. I'm picky about my PRs but this place does it right, oddly enough. You think spectacles or food, surely never both right? If you can afford to, get that as your main and the wonderful Nutter Butter-crusted cheesecake. Yes, Nutter Butter as in the PB biscuit (not cookie, dessert heathens) They have this wretchedly huge Metamorphosis dessert too - order it as a part of your magic show but don't expect it to be your satisfying after dinner bite.

Dripping in sweat!  Why he couldn't explain the same thing in the entrance or lobby was beyond me.  When I started complaining ( we were in line for 1/2 hour) he told me to wait my turn.  When others in line complained we were dying from the heat and the sun, he told them the same.  Been to the magic castle several times and this never happened to me before.  Do not know if he was a manager or what but obviously couldn't care less about the guests.",2 star rating
1688,10/29/2010,"I'm giving this 5 stars for a couple of reasons:1. I've been wanting to go here for many years and the satisfaction of finally being a guest is trumping the objective, pros vs. cons part of my brain. (But then again, no review is ever objective.)2. It's the morning after, so the excitement of last night still very much runs wild in my veins.3. The magicians bent all laws of physics. 4. It felt like I was at Hogwarts.The experience starts before you even enter through the creaky doors. The windy road up, leading to a glimmering ""presence"" starts to work on your nerves as you anticipate what's ahead. The line outside adds more excitement, at which point you can't wait to see what all the commotion is about. (On the other hand, I'm having second thoughts because of the doucheyness all around. Everyone feels entitled and minimally impressed, me being the only one smiling from ear to ear and gawking at the fountain out front, the details on the walls, and the view from where we are.) The inside is a labyrinth of old photos, narrow corridors, endless bars, and throngs of impeccably dressed elite. It's a mixed crowd of young and old, but everyone seems to feel right at home, except for me, of course, who is still wide-eyed in astonishment because of all the pretty colors and textures. Needless to say, I don't think I fit in as seamlessly as I would've liked. The first show I saw was in the Close-Up Gallery that hosts only 22 people. Andrew ""Goldenhands"" Goldenhersh thrilled and amazed, and my boyfriend was lucky enough to participate in his jaw-dropping trick that included a dozen needles, a single string, and a flashlight. I won't say more. The second and last show for us was in the Palace of Mystery. It was sort of a variety show of impressive card tricks, hula hoop madness, and a tap dance performance by the World's Oldest Working Showgirl (age 87). The only thing that ruined the experience was a drunk girl in the back that laughed like a mad hyena without stopping for the entire 45 minutes. I can still hear her shrieks somewhere in the back of my head buzzing like a bad hangover. I will definitely be back. Someday. And maybe even spend the night for the full experience, but for now I'm happy to have seen what I've always doubted on TV and transformed into a believer.",5 star rating

This place is probably more of a kick on a weekend night. Since it's invite-only, I wouldn't know. Sunday was my invite date.Still, it's pretty cool to say you've been there.

I was wrong.  Got Sephanie the other night and embarrassed myself in front of my guests. We ordered drinks and then were left there for at least 15 minutes. We know that because right after we ordered our drinks, we wanted to change to a bottle of wine but she was no where to be found. Then she brought the drinks so we said nothing.  Then we order both appetizers and our entrees.  We sat there for over 30 minutes without even being served bread! Again she  left this time for 15-20 minutes when our salads were served not by Stephanie. At that time we asked Richard where Stephanie was as we haven't even got our appetizers yet! She came to our table, we asked about our appetizers and she never apologized but did give us excuses!!! really!?!  Some of our meals were cold and others were  undercooked due to her not even asking how we wanted them cooked. If this was my first experience with the magic castle, I would have given less stars but the magic is always amazing. Servers like Stephanie give the Castle customers a bad experience.  It overshadows the great magic they saw because all  they remember is the service was terrible, the food medium and it was expensive.

1692,3/27/2015,"I have never actually been to the magic castle so you may be wondering why I am writing this yelp review.  I am writing this because about 2 months ago I called to speak with a manager at the magic castle to see if I could get my terminally ill, soon to be 16 year old patient, into the magic castle for her 16th birthday.  I explained the situation and told them that I worked at the nearby children's hospital as a nurse on the oncology floor.  I wanted to do something special and memorable for this very sweet girl so I, of course, thought of the magic castle.  To say that they were not helpful in the slightest in the understatement of the year.  They proceeded to tell me that I would have to find a member to invite her and then it would cost her family $20 per person to just get in and then another $40 per person to have brunch.  At the end of the very disappointing conversation, the woman said, ""oh and there is a $13 parking fee.""  I have never been more shocked in my whole career as a pediatric oncology nurse than I was at that moment.  The Mann Chinese theatre once offered to shut down the theatre just to accommodate a pt and his friends when he was close to the end of his life.  I wasn't expecting that kind of accommodation but WOW this was just unbelievable.  The woman's lack of compassion regarding the situation was almost inhuman.  After raising $500 through Facebook and the ""payforward app"" to help send her and her family to this very expensive institution, I called the general manager and left a message explaining that we had been successful doing everything  we could do to get this girl to The Magic Castle but here I was left with a very bad taste in my mouth.  You would think that the general manager would call me back to assure me that they would make this special for Camille but no, NOTHING!  Long story short, Camille never made it to The Magic Castle.  She became very ill and then passed away on March 21.  Shame on The Magic Castle for not being a more charitable institution in Los Angeles.  I will personally never visit the magic castle and I will encourage others not to do so either.",1 star rating

Then after that we went to the small theater. It was very cool the magician showed us some really nice card tricks. I was very entertained.Next we walked up stairs to the very back corner, to wait in what? Another line! w00t. This time I had the fortune to run into a magician Magic Mike Jacobson man he was showing us some card trick that he guessed and changed the color of the card. I had to say that was the highlight of the whole evening.As we were waiting for another 40-50min. The room started getting hotter. I had sweat pouring down my backside. My face was warm as all hell. Then as I was about to pass out, they opened the doors to a bigger theater. Which had to be 10* cooler. But not for long as it too began to warm up. As I was about to tear off my clothes and run around like a greased up deaf guy. Watched a very entertaining show of prestidigitation. Back in the main area, whoa man stepped back into a desert. Went to the dining hall to cancel my reservations, gave me a stink about how I would have to pay 20$ per person (80$ for 4) wow. And then laid into me how they could have had given the reservation to someone else. (I looked around and seen several tables open and tons of people to fill them in line) I explained to him that my party and I were very hot, and that it was very uncomfortable. Also I explained I was not the only party and there were 4 other parties that left. The dining room guy was very understanding and did not bill me the cancellation charge.Bailed and as soon as I got outside OMG 50x better weather. Took me a whole 20min to cool down from how hot that place was. If there are any fire marshals out there you need to go to this place on a Friday or Saturday night and make sure they are not in violation.

Main Entre [Prime Rib (bone in holy crap it was huge) with Lobster Tail and a side of Mashed potatoes.  Desert [we actually ordered all of the deserts and so I go to try all of them...  Out of all of them I was quite impressed with the creme bruile, Chocolate Souffle and bread pudding.All of it was very good (highly recommend) - although I probably wouldnt order the Castle Signature Lobster tail appetizer again.  Drinks are strong and good priced.  The bartenders here do a great job of keeping your glass full!  Excellent service!The magic shows were pretty good.  The best show was the Card Trick Guy - it was nuts.  Second was probably the Psychic.  Third was kinda some run of the mill boring standard magic stuff.  Birds, cats and a card trick.In all the experience was GREAT SANS ONE THING!!!This place was built around 1909 (or something) and apparently the place has not been cleaned since then either.  A co-worker and I immediately began noticing that our allergies were going out of control.  It got to the point where I had to run to my car to get two Claritin to take immediately.  I am fairly allergic to dust and mold and this place made me go bannanas.  I mean I woke up the next day with a migraine and all kinds of congestion and sinus pain.  I have only been in one other situation that freaked out my allergies that much and that was at a college friend's apartment where he and she had a whole collection of animals (from rabbits, fish, turtles, cat, and all kinds of crap)!This place is cool but if you have allergies like me - I would stay away.  I actually wanted to get the membership but decided against it after I started getting a headache after about an hour and a half being there.  They really need to do something about it - I am not sure whether its a dust or mold problem but I am definetely going to go dry clean my suit ASAP.  It was THAT BAD.  I think that its due to the fact that they havent remodeled and still have alot of the same stuff - IE wallpaper, carpet, etc.  Did anyone else out there noticed this too???",2 star rating

The magicians are also geared towards kids, so I felt like I was on a school field trip, but with alcohol. I'll be back for the dinner service, but no more brunch attempts.",3 star rating
1699,5/7/2007,"I had the pleasure of experiencing the Magic Castle this past weekend and I have to say, I was pretty excited. First of all, if you don't already know this, you need to either be a member or know a member who can give you a guest pass to go to the Magic Castle. I was lucky enough to obtain a guest pass from a fellow yelper and it accommodated up to 8 people including me. This is one of the reasons I love Yelp so much. I was pretty astounded over the fact that a perfect stranger was willing to help me out.The dress code is strict. Tie and Jacket for men, a dress or matching pantsuit for women. It's definitely fun to dress up so make an event of it and have an elegant night out.The night is going to be a costly one... There is a $20 entrance fee per person. Valet parking is $7 without tip. Dinner.. is very expensive for mediocre food. The drinks from the bar are costly as well.. A vodka tonic set me back $10. The bread they bring out is pretty interesting tasting.. It's smells and tastes like Cinnamon. Reviews on the prime rib amongst my group weren't so great... Neither was the steak... Nor the seafood louie salad... The daily fresh fish special which happened to be an orange roughy was a bit better.. However, the side vegetables were comprised mostly of squash which wasn't that appealing.  Dinner for 2 including drinks came out to about $80 including drinks, tax, and tip.The shows are funny and entertaining. The mansion itself is fun to roam around in and it's worth it to stop by the bars that are located on all floors since there are magicians who tend bar and do magic there. My favorite was the magician at the Hat and Hare pub. His card tricks were AMAZING. There are also numerous magicians in the numerous nooks and crannies around the entire place.  If you can score a guest pass, this place is a great place for a fun night out with friends or entertain out of town guests. That is, if you don't mind paying an arm and leg.",4 star rating
1700,11/21/2010,"I don't care that there ARE 400, almost 500 reviews of the Magic Castle here...I still feel oh-so-exclusive for being able to score entry here.  So... let me have my moment, okay?My husband literally grew up up the street from here and though his parents have been lucky enough to go a few times, he hasn't and I definitely haven't.  So we jumped at the chance to go when we got an invitation this past Friday.  Dinner reservations for 6 pm....so exciting.  We got all dolled up in our finest and though I was annoyed at having to wear fancy shmancy clothes and heels...I then realized I RARELY ever get to play dress up like that so I just embraced the whole thing.  Service was impeccable from the start.  From the guys at the Valet to the adorable lil woman greeting us.  Not once did we ever feel like we were surrounded by snobs - by the staff nor the other guests.  Every little detail was beautiful....from the 'secret' door you open with the 'magic words' to the paintings on the walls that move.  The characters you find in this joint will blow your mind....beautiful women dressed in full goth evening wear regalia, men in ascots and tuxedos, people of all ages dressed to their finest.  It's a wonderful sight.  So we sat down for dinner and were promptly greeted by Rich, our awesome server.  The decor is Old Hollywood meets a bit of kitsch and just plain ol' beautiful.  For a place that has everyone hemming and hawing to get in, I'd imagine the food could easily get away with being mediocre.  But it wasn't!  The food was actually delectable!  Our table's orders:3 cheese garlic bread (whoa whoa whoa... this was so oooey gooooey and yummy!)Portobello fries with a ponzu dipping sauceCaesar Salads with some yummy yummy croutonsSalmon served with artichoke and risotto...some of the best 'restaurant' salmon I've ever tried...not dry AT ALL!Beef WellingtonSpire of Onion RingsLobster Mac n Cheese (yup... you read that correctly!)Lobster Bisque.  So... we're a bunch of hungry fatties... whatchu gonna do about it? Everything was truly delicious.  I was impressed.  Everything was juicy where it needed to be, crispy where it needed to be, and creamy and decadent where it needed to be.  Ok.. so we did have to take some food home... and even that, the Magic Castle handles with grace.  They bring you a lil black box to pack up your food and a silver pen to write your last name on it.  Then they take it so that you can enjoy the rest of your night.  When you're ready to leave, you just let them know your last name at the exit, and they hand you your take home food. Genius. So, on to the shows.  There's just a multitude of shows spread across a multitude of beautiful rooms.  Pick up a show schedule to find out who's performing where at what time.  Make sure you get to a show about 30 minutes before it actually starts.. the rooms fill up QUICK!  We happened in on a night of old school magic.. you know.. the kind where you cut women in half and the box girls dress in glittery apparel.  We also carnie acts.. you know, the old school carnival guys. tons of old school humor with magic thrown in.  Bar service in every room, magicians around every corner...the Magic Castle definitely wants to impress.  Sure, it's kitschy, sure I don't believe in magic and am a skeptic from the get go... but this place does a great job serving up some Old Hollywood with a magical humorous twist. And they have good food... I'm sold.",5 star rating

1702,9/3/2010,"Don't complain about the cover charge.  If you don't know a member that can get you in for free, then yes, you have to pay to get in.  (I am not am member but have always been invited by a member and never paid to get in.)Don't complain about the magic shows during the day being geared towards kids.  That's the purpose of having the day shows.  Go at night if you want to see an adult show.The Magic Castle is a private magician's club.  It is not Disneyland.   There are no rides, no hidden tunnels, no special effects.  It's a place where you can dress up for the evening (how often do we get to do THAT anymore?), have dinner (or brunch), and just enjoy magic.  If you are the kind of person that scoffs at every magic trick, then why even come? Brunch at the castle is delicious.  Dinner is a hit or miss.  I was very disappointed once when my roasted chicken and risotto came out cold.  I did, however, have the filet once and it was perfect.   The lobster mac & cheese was too salty once, but I gave it another chance recently and it was delicious.  I wasn't too much a fan of the lobster bisque.  If there are at least 4 of you in your dinner party, try the Metamorphosis for dessert.  It is made with three different flavors of ice cream and Oreos and candy bars... and it's HUGE.  Every time I've had a not so good experience at the Magic Castle, it's due to rude, pushy guests.   I've waited patiently in line for a show, only to have 20 people line up in front of me because their one friend was saving their places in line.  I also hate going to a show where someone is saving a whole row of seats because their friends are late.  And why why WHY would you reserve a table for 18 so you can be loud and rowdy at dinnertime so that your neighbors can't have a normal conversation at their dinner table?I've seen some great magic shows and not so great magic shows.  If you're THAT picky about how amazing the magic will be, find out who is performing before you decide to go (yes, you CAN do that).   But if you're not a fan of magic, don't bother coming.  You just ruin it for the rest of us.",4 star rating
1703,7/31/2007,"About a year ago, my friend says to me, ""hey, I want to go to the Magic Castle for my birthday.  Do you want to come?""  Of course, I love birthdays and any reason to celebrate.  But I was a little apprehensive about the food. After my meal, I would say the food has definitely improved since the last time I went (well over 6 years ago). We had the oysters, calamari, crab dip and fried artichoke hearts for appetizers. The oysters were fresh and creamy- quite wonderful. The next best app was the calamari but the plate was extremely small for $8 or $9 a pop and too little marinara. The crab dip was passable but also $$$. I could have done without the breading on the fried artichoke hearts.The Caesar salad I had to start was terrible! Too ""soupy"" with the dressing and the little bits of anchovy was distracting. I would have preferred none or filets of anchovy. The lettuce was also very yellow.My NY steak was surprisingly good. My favorite cut is the ribeye which they didn't have and I don't care for prime rib or filet so NY steak it was for me. Whatever that little bullet of sauce they serve with the steak was worth it but the meat stood out on its own.My vodka tonics were fine but I was disturbed by the number of glass types it came in. My first drink was served in a tall skinny glass and the second in a shorter stouter glass.The service could have been better. Our waiter was trying to accommodate our large party but he rubbed me the wrong way. I think the general pushing of people to order more drinks to up his tip was really bad.I passed on dessert but the group seemed to enjoy the chocolate soufle. The group also seemed to like their lobster tails (huge!) and various cuts of steak. Overall, I rather spend my money on a better steakhouse but I'm glad the food has improved for those who have to eat at the Castle.I spent about $75 on food, drinks, tax and tip.",3 star rating
1704,9/5/2007,"Yay! I'm going back to the Magic Castlle while I'm on business in LA. I haven't been back in years, since I performed there (that's the full disclosure happenning again)This mansion is what so many magic hotels and clubs and bars are based on. It's up for sale damnit, and it's one of the last classy magic destinations every lover of magic should visit.It's a private club, so you must know a member, and you should really plan on staying all night so you can see all the magic shows, in the close up room, the parlour, and the stage, let alone all the various magic that happens in the lounges, halls, and other secret rooms.  have the expensive dinner and explore the secret staircases, talk to Irma the invisible piano player who will play any song you like, see some ghosts, come back for Halloween Seances in the secret back room, when you're sober, come back and check out the library (with a magician to guide you of course)I'd love to open the NY version of this luxurious scene in the next few years. It is coat required lol. My ex made the mistake of forgetting and they made him wear a plaid tie and jacket. lol a scene straight out of a  Dean Martin comedy. The acts range from astounding oh my god I need to change religions, to omg this guy sucks get me the hell out of here but it is worth the experience. I've met quite a few amazing people here, magic wise, in the sciences, the arts, and some cool celebrities, like Tony Curtis--awesome! FULL DISCLOSURE AND SELF PROMO: I'm performing there the week of Jan 21-27th.  if anyone wants to meet up, I might be able to hook you up with admission, just let me know.

The castle itself is just gorgeous, set on a hilltop overlooking LA, and the turret sold me the minute I saw it. PARKINGValet is $8 per car, kind of expensive, so i suggest you carpool if possible. LOBBY / ATMOSPHEREAwesome. The furniture, the walls, the decor are all 5 stars. I felt like I was in this old mansion castle with all the mystical and historical aura surrounding me. The castle is huge and you can easily get lost in it, so I stuck to my group as we explored the museums, the close up shows, and the different drinking parlors. MAGICThe main magic show was a huge disappointment. The best part of the main show was the host, because he was funny and personable. The 1st act was better than the 2nd, but we all could see the lines, the pockets, and the slight of hand giveaways. The 2nd act was insanely cheesy with overly expressive faces and I think the girl was doing the macarena at some points. I know that magic shows are overexpressive already, and was expecting it, but this was really really ridiculous. We were all laughing but it was still a good time to be had talking about it afterwards. CLOSE UP MAGICThis was my favorite. Helder was the close up magician's name. I think he is from Portugal and has been awarded the best close up act ever. I agree. He was charming, funny, charismatic, and incredibly good. He did this vending machine act and somehow got a bottle of wine to come out of his pants. I don't know how he did that but any man that can pull a gigantic bottle of wine out of nowhere gets my vote!! ..:: AHI TUNA TAR TARAppetizer. Came with chips. The tar tar was nothing special, but it was good and refreshing. I should have just ordered this and another appetizer for dinner. ..::FRIED MUSHROOMSThe mushroom was really flavorful and good. The sauce was also good, and I wanted more of this. The appetizer is big and good to share. ..:: SAUTEED MUSHROOMSIt was cooked in a cast iron bowl with a top. The mushrooms were really rich and flavorful, but was kind of soggy and overpowering. I actually used it as a sauce for a wellington steak instead of having it as a side. ..:: WELLINGTON STEAKI asked for this steak rare. It came out pink and pretty tender, which is nice. However, the sauce was way below par. It was a dark sauce that almost tasted like hoison sauce, and I was not a fan of that. I ended up eating it with the sauteed mushrooms instead. The vegetables were ok, but nothing really that flavorful. I left a lot of my plate as I tried to finish the expensive steak, but i wasn't that impressed overall. ..::RACK OF LAMBI thought this was quite good. I only had a few tastings of friends' but I thought it was the best dish of the night. ..::NEW YORK STRIPVery bland. MY friend asked for it rare and it was really bland and dry. I didn't eat more than a bite, and did not want any more.

1716,8/11/2007,"This review is for the food, not the magic.As a restaurant and for the price you pay, this is a sub standard place.   The lobster was frozen and had a mealy texture.   Not what you would expect for a $50 entree.  The seafood linguini was good but not worth $30.   The mixed grill of pork, rack of lamb, steak and sausage was good but again not worth the $40 entree charge.   A side order of mac and cheese was $7.  It was more like cheese flavored macaroni.   They should have used more cheese on the dish.  It turned out dry.And as you can guess the drinks are outrageous.  $2.75 for a coke.   Most bottles of wine approach $100.   Buy the wine only if you want to impress your party that you can spend lots of money.   The food is subsidizing the magic...which is all well and good if you understand the math here. This is on top of a $20 cover charge.  You can only get a main theater ticket if you eat here.   At these prices, they should hire a 5 star chef to manage the kitchen.   My advice.  Eat a light dinner before coming here...and order the minimum amount of food to get a theater ticket. Like the magic, the food is all show and no substance...(that is a compliment for a slight of hand magician)",2 star rating

Yeah the place is more exclusive than a sleepover at the neverland ranch (too soon?) You have to get dressed up in your finest digs which makes the place even more fun. Suits and cocktail dresses abound and you're guaranteed to see a few sweet magician mustaches if you look hard enough. I'm having a hard time coming up with words to describe the vibe that is created by the decor and the crowd but everyone is super friendly and for the most part everyone just seemed super excited to be there. I could probably spend another night there just checking out all the cool stuff on the walls and listening to stories about the amazing history the place has. It's truly fascinating to be at a place that is solely dedicated to such a specialized and awe-inspiring craft. The place isn't an event hall that sometimes does magic shows Its sole purpose in life is to bring magic to the people, you've got to respect that.

Couple of shrimp and some calamari rings does not constitute a ""seafood"" in the dish name.  At $50 per person, it was a bit much - by the way - not including the $25 at the door. We skipped dessert and went right into the shows.  I am writing this a week later and I can't say anything sticks out in my mind as amazing.  The guy that MCs the show in the main room was pretty funny, but that was about it.  Great first time experience.  Not sure if I would come back.",3 star rating

It just so happened that my parents were visiting from out of town the next day - so I called them up and told them I had a BIG surprise :)George met us at the door, where we bypassed the people standing in line for their dinner reservations. We were lucky to have such a great tour guide in George, as he told us about all history that is a part of every feature of the castle. I was pretty happy that my mom got to say the magic words...""open sesame"" to move the wall and grant us access inside. Once inside, we saw tons of bars, strolling magicians, 3 very awesome shows (one...I got to be an assistant and debut my acting chops) and my husband and step dad saw Mickey Rourke.

1721,7/6/2011,The Magic Castle had great food and service. I enjoy eating there however the actual castle itself and decor is a bit tacky. I don't know what they do with the membership fee money but it certainly is not going into the decor at the castle. It's fun to explore the many hidden little rooms but unless its busy it's a bit dead and boring. The magic show was funny and entertaining. While living in LA I frequented the Castle but since moving to NYC I have been a few times and lately I am a bit disappointed in the amount of tourists.

1723,3/10/2010,"I've been here three times now; it's ""exclusive,"" but it's just one of those places you keep ending up if you live here long enough.*  It's a good place to take someone visiting the city for the first time; if you talk them into staying at the hotel there, they can even be the one to score you the invite.  The dress code is a bit obnoxious but you get to dress up and make a night of it, which can be cool.The Castle itself is cool; it isn't necessary well maintained, but that's part of its charm.  It's nestled in a beautiful hill above hollywood; go up the hill and you'll catch some great views of the city (as well as Yamashiro).  You can walk around and explore, and you'll wander into parts that feel ""secret.""  The food is mediocre at best.  Really not up to par for what they're charging, or for the building itself.  I mean, this is a castle, after all -- we should be eating like European royalty, not like Jersey Shore wage-earners.  This is a cut or two above diner food.  It's not bad, it's just not that memorable.Of course, food isn't the reason to come here.  What you come for is the magic, and unfortunately, I just don't care for magic all that much.  It can be impressive when it's well done, and it occasionally is -- but be prepared for an interminable sequence of card tricks and tedious sleight of hand.  If you've spent any time around magic or magicians in the past, don't come here expecting to find anyone testing out clever new material.  And of course, this is Hollywood, so every magician is also a comedian and an actor -- for better or for worse.  At least they generally don't try to sing. My favorite magic trick in the Castle is probably the cheapest gimmick they have -- the player piano that is supposedly played by a ghost; you pick a song and shout it out and the ghost plays it.  It's not that the trick itself is that exciting, but the range of music in the ghost's database is impressive -- classical, jazz standards, blues, rock, funk, and more.  I spent a half hour trying to stump her with no success (to be fair, I did stick to requests that weren't totally obscure and would sound good on a piano). Also, an evening at this place is definitely a sausage-oriented event.  There's the occasional group of hot women looking to cause trouble, but mostly the joint will be full of single men and couples.  The actual members of the Castle are certainly well-to-do financially (I've heard a membership is in the five figure range, but it's hearsay), so as someone else posted, it's probably a great place to cruise for sugar daddies.  If you're looking to talk to the ladies, however, you might want to check out other locations.I've had a decent time here, and I would go again under the right circumstances, but I can think of a lot more entertaining things to do when I'm feeling dressy and spendy.  *OK, I was going to give this place only two stars, but right after I wrote that first sentence, a friend called me completely out of the blue and invited me to the Magic Castle.  Tonight.  I'm not going, but I am blown away by the coincidence that she called just as I started writing this review.  So the place gets an extra star for whatever actual magic may have been involved in that creepiness.",3 star rating
1724,1/22/2010,"Add a visit to the Magic Castle to your list of things to do in LA.  If you don't know what this is, imagine an old Victorian mansion which houses an upscale bar, with features reminiscent both of an R-rated Disneyland and a spy movie.  Oh, and they do magic tricks here, too.  I came here on a random Tuesday night with the bf and his co-workers (someone knew someone's cousin who was a magician, and we got an invite), and had a fabulous time. So I suppose I should break my review up into three parts: the mansion/club itself, the restaurant and bars, and the shows.Part I: Mansion/club: Fun, quirky, and old-fashioned.  You enter this mess by speaking to a wooden owl on a bookcase, and it just gets better.  The place is basically an extremely ornate, mildly disorienting maze of hallways and rooms.  Since it was a weeknight, many of the rooms were empty, giving the place a nicely creepy vibe (note: vibe enhanced by alcohol).  Highlights included the downstairs ""museum"" (a series of dark hallways with neat retro magic props in glass cases), and a haunted piano which plays songs upon request.  Part II: Restaurant/bars: Excellent service and food, if not a teensy bit overpriced.  Bar glasses of wine ran about $10 each, but were tastier than your standard house wine (I had a particularly good zinfandel), and glasses were poured generously.  Since we weren't members, we had to spend something like $25 each on dinner, which was not difficult or unreasonable.  Items which stood out were crab cakes (full of crab meat in an excellently caper-y sauce) and the rack of lamb.  Suprisingly not as good were the chili and the lobster mac and cheese (yes, I know it sounds exciting, but it really just tasted like fishy cheese!).  Part III: Shows: The shows definitely make this place.  I would probably have been bitter about having to pay $20 cover plus dinner just to run around in someone's magical mansion, no matter how cool it was.  The shows here were a real treat though.  Real stand-outs were Jason England--the quintessential card sharp who gives a lecture-style show on card manipulation and gambling--and Ed Alonzo--a really wacky guy who is actually just a little weird!  Catching a show in the close-up gallery is a must (you are right next to the performer and you still get fooled), but usually means a twenty minute wait or so, since there are only about 25 seats in the auditorium.  So to recap, my evening lasted about 6 hours, I spent probably $100 total (for valet, cover, food, drinks), and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.  I highly recommend anyone who gets an invite to go!",5 star rating
1725,6/22/2014,"I had a great time here enjoying the old Hollywood atmosphere. I ordered the lobster tail with mash potatoes and veggies they were cooked perfect. The lobster was like butter. My bf ordered the filet mignon it had a croissant type of breading around it. When I first saw it I thought it looked gross because of its rawness, but its actually delicious. I will definitely come back within the year to watch more magic shows. I only saw 2, and it was the headliners. It was the host from cup cakes wars and some other dude. I can't remember the names at the moment, but the second magicians type of magic is theatre like. Both were entertaining. There were times it felt camped up in that dig though it didn't really bother me. 5 stars for the experience!",5 star rating
1726,6/4/2015,"This review has nothing to do with the magicians, hosts, bartenders, ambience and overall experience and is simply based on one thing, our server. Being a guest at the Magic Castle I am fully aware that every time I go I have to pay for an expensive dinner. I have absolutely no problem with that even though the food is only good at best but I'm there to see the magic. In fact, I was trying to plan out our evening so that we can see as many magicians as possible. Unfortunately our server had different plans. While he spent all his time singing songs to other tables and constantly pushing extra food on our table he was otherwise nonexistent. Why? Because he knew he had an 18% gratuity off of our table regardless of his service because we were a party of six or more. So he spent all his time with all the two tops and four tops so that they would give him good tips knowing that we had no choice but to pay for whatever crappy service he was giving us. The most frustrating part was that we were trying to catch the last show of a really popular magician that night and we would've made it had our server listened to us when we told him four times that we would like separate checks. Instead it took him 20 minutes just to bring us the check with its 18% gratuity on it and we were left to figure out who is paying what. Then it took another 10 minutes for him to return because he was singing yet again to another table and then another five minutes to run the credit cards. When it was all said and done the show was actually wrapping up. I will visit the castle again and hope to have a different server.",2 star rating
1727,9/29/2010,"Had dinner reservation for 6pm to celebrate our anniversary.  Had to deal with a pretty rude guy named Anthony on the phone to make the reservation (you can tell he hated his job...)  Read some of the reviews before arrival so I wasn't expecting much for food so I wasn't surprised when the food was mediocre...esp for the price.  Dinner for 2 with no drinks cost us over $90.  We also got seated at a pretty bad location eventhough I had previously requested a nicer seating since it was such a special day.  Also, since it's still bright outside at this time, the dining room isn't as pretty with all the bright light...we noticed how much nicer it looked once it got dark later as we walked through it again to get to a showroom.One good thing about the night was that we randomly met a member of the MC while standing in line for one of the shows and he gave us the inside scoop on which magicians were worth seeing for the night.  We ended up seeing about 4 different shows and had a great time!You can't take pictures inside so take your shots outside.  Also Valet expects to be paid when you drop off the car so have some cash ready.$20 entrance fee per person unless you can get hooked up.My husband and I agreed that although we had a great time and our visit definitely satisfied our curiousity about the magic castle, we probably won't be back.  Nonetheless, it's ""different""....everyone should try it once!",3 star rating

1731,1/3/2008,"Wow.  Talk about being totally exclusive - AND FUN!  The Magic Castle brings back the childhood wonders and amazements of good ol' magic shows.  And it literally is a castle.  It's too bad you have to be a member or know a member to get into this prestigious house of magic to experience something like this.  This is probably what ""Gob"" (if you watch Arrested Development, then you would know) would have been a part of when he joined the Magician's Alliance. It feels like you stepped into a high rollers' estate club, as everyone is formally dressed - a strict dress code is enforced.  The atmosphere is great and the experience begins the moment you check in.  To actually say ""Open Sesame"" to open th entrance door - How awesome is that?!   It's great to bring a group of friends along and watch magic performed right in front of your eyes from real professional magicians.The shows are separated by times and in separate small rooms.  That means at different times, there's always a show to catch with a different magician performing tricks to puzzle and intrigue you.  You'll surely ask yourself how they do those tricks and each night is different.  The downside? The rooms hold about 20-30 people so waiting in line early for a show will occur frequently if you want to be entertained the entire night.Then there's the restaurant.  Our dinner reservation was at 9:30PM which gave us time to catch a few shows prior and then after dinner.  The food was merely decent.  Nothing spectacular and quality was okay.  I ordered the prime rib medium rare, and it came out much rarer than I was expecting.  Sweet corn and sweet potato fries were good though.   Also, a couple of my friends found their wine glasses not fully cleansed.Nonetheless, the Magic Castle is one of those rare special opportunities you can't miss if you've earned an invite.  It's very different inside, with a spooky...almost haunted vibe inside but oh so fitting.  It's definitely out there a la Harry Potter.  You'll find plenty of interesting things to look at, including a myriad of  portraits of famous magicians old and new on the walls, up and down the various halls, and stairsways.  Don't forget to check out the lone piano in the bar, with Irma, the ghost pianist, playing your requests.  Oh and check out the fortune-telling phone booth ;).  It never lies!You will be enchanted.  You will be mesmerized.  You will be entertained.  And you will want to come back!  Definitely check this place out if you're into magic and know anyone who is a member to get you in.",4 star rating

1733,3/5/2013,"i've had an invitation to the magic castle floating around my treasure chest for many years now and i finally got around to using it this past sunday. my boyfriend and i rolled up to the valet around six thirty pm, dressed to the nines in a monochromatic scheme with bold splashes of color. him in a three piece black and white pin stripe suit with a french collared tuxedo shirt and a bright bubblegum-blue tie. me in a simple yet elegant black and white cocktail dress that was offset by my atomic pink hair. i don't know why people complain about the dress code being so strict because it seems like if you at least made an effort to put yourself together, they're not going to scrutinize every single detail of your ensemble. the girl at the door barely gave us a glance before asking for our invite and in no time, i was saying ""open sesame"" to the owl and the bookcase slid aside to let us in. it's a sumptuous and quirky place, sorta bordello meets disneyland, and we spent a lot of time exploring the labyrinthine corridors and numerous bars. there's a lot to see and we saw almost all of it with the exception of the close-up gallery which was jam packed all night. we first stopped by the grand piano where i dropped a couple bucks into the birdcage and asked invisible irma to play ""yer birthday"" by the beatles (it was my boyfriend's birthday). she gladly obliged and we had the first cocktail of the night, toasting to our youth while listening to her lovely rendition of the song. we then went downstairs to check out the small display of magical artifacts that is referred to as the museum and ended up being treated to a one-on-one exhibition of close up magic by a magician hanging out down there. it was a lovely, intimate display and it might have been my favorite part of the night, with just my boyfriend and me seated at a table while monte the magician performed for, and with, us.our dinner reservations were for the eight o'clock seating and the food was decent. the calamari was a little limp and the main entrees were a bit too salty (although the prime rib was perfectly rare, as requested) but the chocolate lava cake for desert was delicious. the meal was pricey for the quality but, hey, it's all part of the package when visiting the magic castle. we saw two other shows over the course of the evening, one in the parlor of prestidigitation and one in the larger palace of mystery. i thoroughly enjoyed the performance in the parlor, which only seats sixty people- it was a lovely mix of sleight of hand and mentalism that left me awed and vexed. the palace show on the other hand, was a mixed bag. it was an ensemble act with three magicians teaming up to put on the performance and while i absolutely adored rob zabrecky and tina lenert was an enchanting sight to see, i did not at all enjoy the comedic contributions of ardan james. overall we had a fantastic time. we drank a lot of alcohol, saw all kinds of magic, and left full of wonderment... definitely a unique los angeles experience.",5 star rating
1734,10/20/2008,"This place is AWESOME! You start off by telling the doors to open... OPEN SESAME! Then we had a tour of the castle! After the tour we were seated for dinner... Why did i give this place a 4 rather than a 5 if i think it's so awesome? Because the food was, well, mediocre. HOWEVER, the magic castle house wine is very good. What was mediocre about the food? The salad was good (house field... yummy tomato dressing), but the mashed potatoes that came with my filet mignon were not so good. I felt like they might have been made from a packet.  The filet was okay... not very well seasoned. However, it was cooked to the right amount like i asked (medium). The cheesecake was pretty good... but not great. For the food portion of the evening, i would rank it at a 3.BUT FOR THE MAGIC, A 10!!! (If possible). I'm pretty skeptical of stuff... so in reality, the big performances where i'm not close to the stage tend to leave me dissatisfied. However, the close up shows were AMAZING! Because I really have NO IDEA how those coins/ cards/ marbles/ sugar kept disappearing/ reappearing/ changing. It was AMAZING! And the shows aren't the only place where magic's happening! It's EVERYWHERE! Ask people (when you go... and you SHOULD go) if they are magicians... your bartender, your tour guide, your waiter. Because many times they ARE! And they will totally show you! We were walking around because we missed 1 show... and we just RAN INTO a guy doing card/ coin/ whatevs magic! It was pretty freaking cool!Here's the breakdown on money for this place... because it's not a cheap evening. Glasses of house wine: $7.Valet Parking without tip: $8Entrance: $20Filet Mignon: $33Salad: $7Garlic Bread: $6 Cheesecake: $ can't remember! HA!GOING TO A MAGIC CASTLE... PRICELESS! (JUST SAYING!)

We got the burrata to start and it was very thrown together and i didn't like the grapefruit pairing, we also got the chipotle Mac & Cheese and it was pretty much dry noodles and a crunch on top...I think they forgot the cheese...seriously. Our main dishes of Beef Wellington and Beef Short Rib were ooookay and the side veggies and mashed potatoes tasted like cheap wedding food. The cost for it all including a round of drinks was almost $200 for 2 people...which was a major disappointment for the quality of food. However, like I said, the service was excellent. Entry was $20 each, a photo was $20, and valet was $13. It was an expensive night and worth it if you've never been there and love magic.

1737,10/16/2009,"went here for the first time on my bday last nite and i had a really great time there. my friends and i had smiles on our faces the whole time.   if you are invited and have an invite card, it's $30 at the door and you are required to have dinner.  we did not have to eat dinner since we were walked in by one of the magicians, so i won't be able to give any info on what they serve, but i do know that plates range from $40-90 per plate.  the drinks i do know were about $12.50 each for a grey goose or any top shelf drink.  it is a very upscale dress code. guys have to wear a coat and tie and ladies have to wear a cocktail dress or some sort of equivalent.  it was fun getting dressed up and having a a nite out with a bunch of friends. this is a perfect place to bring a date. you and your date will not have a dull moment. all of the magicians that we saw were friendly, made us laugh, as well as amazed us with all their slight of hand tricks.   i read some reviews from people who gave this place bad reviews, and i think those people in general don't have fun anywhere they go, and are probably negative about everything they rate, so don't pay attention to them and go have the time of your life at this place!  i definitely will be coming back here again. it beats going to some bar or club where you have to pay $20 or $30 to get in and pay the same amount of $$$ for drinks and get no entertainment value.",5 star rating
1738,6/29/2014,"A real deal review on The Magic Castle.  First and foremost it's a relativity expensive evening. Cocktails are. $10 to $12. $30 cover on weekends unless you have a VIP pass or come with a member. The food; I've read that the Castle had been working to improve the dining experience. Our server was great. I've read people get their feathers ruffled because the server didn't take the women's order first, our server did. Food quality, my filet and lobster was comparable to the same dish at Claim Jumper or Outback. Filet oscar style was $40 including sides. Salad/soup was. $10 and good. $9 Garlic cheese bread was good. A really good version of this meal at Ruth's Chris or Donavan's, etc. would have been $55 for the filet oscar style plus sides at $10 each. I think the disconnect on the food is the formal dress dinner and fancy high end atmosphere with food that falls short of high end dining. My suggestion is take the food up in quality or lower the price of each dish by $5. What to expect: I think you need to be the type of person in touch with their inner child to really appreciate this place. Much like a castle in a scooby doo cartoon with a very Disney esq touch this isn't a high end club experience. If you get turned on by sophisticated adult contemporary restaurants, clubs, and turned off by eating in the Pirates of the Caribbean ride restaurant the castle probably isn't for you. On the other hand if you enjoy themed, fun fantasy type experiences you'll love the castle and you'll be amongst friends. The Magic was quality. The crowds; my wife's take was that after spending a good chunk on drinks, food and cover there were too many people allowed in. Paying $400 for an evening, access and comfort should have been better meaning less lines, less crowded spaces.I gave an extra star for unique factor. I say you should go at least once and spend the money. Unless you are a uptight, trendy person that goes out to be seen... And won't accept anything but the best then you should pass on the Castle. Ideally the Castle would make it more exclusive by limited guest passes, lowering drink and food prices so it can be a regular spot and not too over crowded.",4 star rating
1739,1/23/2007,"Holy crap! My first Five Star rating! I've been invited to The Magic Castle several times and I need to go many more times. The food is overpriced basic American comfort food like meatloaf and turkey -- but the whole point of going to this ding dang place is to get dressed up (guy are required to jackets and, I believe, ties) and tap into your childlike wonder (by getting really really drunk) and enjoy the magic! Of course, I respect the illusionists like I respect anyone who's trying to make an honest buck, but I have always laughed my ass off in sheer pleasure when I go to this joint. Since working in the entertainment industry for so long has robbed me of most of my youthful innocence, two of the handful of things that I hold onto to keep from jumping off the Capitol Records building are great food and prestidigitation!

1740,8/3/2007,"The Magic Castle is pretty cool. I like magic and remember watching the old David Copperfield specials in the 90's. This place, though, brings you back to the old mystique of magic and has a great feel to it. Old school mansions are rad. Yes, I said ""rad"". I must agree with most here that the food is average at best and very expensive. But you kind of have to just buck up and weather through it, because the meal isn't the main attraction here - the magic is. The acts always change and the night I went it ranged from ""so-so"" to ""hilarious"" to ""excellent"". In one of the small show rooms we saw a Japanese magician who had won a few different rewards, and he was probably the best act I saw of the night. Making things disappear and reappear, he was lightning quick. Also saw a random act that just happened to be added which was a combination of magic and odd dancing, which was just the right mix to keep you interested.I hadn't seen so many ""older"" people getting so thoroughly hammered at a place in a long time. And they definitely throw a few back at the MC. Which was funny yet also a little scary - both because the drinks are expensive and because you know they're driving around Hollywood later that night. But we left somewhat early since my brother was a party pooper and didn't have to worry about it too much. Anyways, I enjoyed the MC and would come back again if I got an invite. Fun times had by all, that's for sure.",4 star rating
1741,4/28/2011,"Magic! MAGIC! Twas an expensive, but nevertheless, magical night!Valet Parking: $8, Cover: $25, Dinner: $50, Soaking up in an adult Disneyland-like Magical Universe = priceless. Close Up gallery is THE BEST (Maybe because I'm slightly biased since I got chosen to be the volunteer sitting right next to the magician for the entire show). Intimate theater for 22 people max. On a busy night, probably should line up 30-45 minutes before, because once it is full, it's full. Main theater show was slightly disappointing. 3 varied acts, but it was definitely ""more for show"" than magic, I felt. They do have rotating magicians for every week, so maybe we caught an off week. Caught our last show at the Parlour of Prestidigitation (i can't even pronounce that word!). Another first come, first serve show. Not as intimate as the Close Up Gallery but still enough to be in the thick of the action. Seats about 58?   Definitely plan to make an evening out of the trip, to explore (may not look big when you pull up, but the castle is structured like a labyrinth), and there is a lot of idle time just waiting around for shows to start, standing in line for shows to get the best seats (which is why I compared it to Disneyland) so make sure you are with a good crowd (maybe slightly liquored up). 21+ only at nights. Next time (crossing my fingers for another invite), definitely skipping the dinner (the menu now clearly states: MANDATORY 1 ENTRÉE PER GUEST; cheapest entrée was about $26) so I can catch more of the close up shows. They are totally serious about the Dress Code. My friend tried to get in wearing a black leather jacket, and they made him take it off & swapped it with a weird faded coat jacket instead.CAMERA: I wished I brought mine!!! Even though they say no photography in the castle, we took a few grainy camera photos in the bathroom, & there was no bag search so definitely do bring your camera for a few stolen pictures!",4 star rating
1742,11/22/2010,Had a friend who got us into magic castle so decided to check it out. We came mainly to see Mike Jacobson. $25 dollar cover.When we got there the guy at the door was super nice. Came into a pretty cool looking room where we approached a door and said the secret word to open the door. fuuuunn.The shows are scheduled and there is sometimes a wait and a line in order to view certain ones. They are fairly small intimate settings so you can view the magic tricks up close. The magicians really interact with the crowd which made it a lot more interesting. Upstairs was for guests who want to have dinner and see more elaborate shows. I was told the food was sub par and so we opted out. Overall I thought it was fun and somewhat entertaining. I am personally not too into magic unless I've had a couple drinks and then a rock could amuse me. I wouldn't come here again but I would suggest maybe checking it out once being that it is a special landmark.,3 star rating
1743,2/10/2011,"I didn't know Magic Castle was supposed to be this exclusive 'cool guy' club. I really don't see the purpose to shun the public out, but whatever. Before you can enter the castle, you have to say 'open sesame'. When you walk in, it's very old and vintage. There are about 5 bars scattered throughout the castle as well as a bunch of magicians doing mainly card tricks. The only impressive show I saw was the show all the way downstairs by the parlor bar. He mainly did card tricks, but he was a pretty funny guy.They told us we had to have dinner at the castle as well and everyone needed to spend at least $15. In all honesty, none of the food sounded appetizing. It was your basic chicken, steak, and seafood that most American restaurants have. But since we had to order something, we got the Roasted Half Chicken, Deviled Eggs and Portobello Fries. The Portobello fries were alright, they were fried tempura style and were a bit heavy for my taste. The deviled eggs were just straight up unpopular with our table. It literally smelled like sweaty feet. The chicken was surprisingly the best dish of the night; it was actually pretty juicy and the lemon au jus was really interesting. The chicken also came with a side of risotto. Now, I'm a big Top Chef fan and during last week's episode when Tre got eliminated, they said that risotto was supposed to be runny and just spread on your plate. The risotto at MC was stiff, a bit hard and overly cheesy... I wonder what those Top chef judges would of said about it?I'm glad I got to go to the ever so exclusive Magic Castle at least once, but honestly, I wouldn't go back. There are way too many.... 'cool guys' there. Not for me.Recommendation: Eat before and don't spend a lot at dinner. Use that money to get hammered, magic is always more fun when you're toasty.",3 star rating

1748,7/10/2007,"For your reference, I am rating this as 5 stars because of the overall unique experience of the castle. This is not a rating based merely on the food. I've been here over a dozen times because I know a member and my clients also work here. You need to either be a member or be invited by a member to enter the castle. There are two types of invitation. One is a VIP card which allows you plus three others to enter without the standard entrance fee. The regular guest card allows up to eight guests but there is a $20 entrance fee per guest. Magicians come from all over the world to perform here. There are also lots of magicians who frequent the castle and watch the shows. Parking is valet-only and runs roughly $8-10 (unless you want to park across the street and walk up the driveway which I've NEVER seen). There was a Dateline special about the valet stealing the change and valuables in guests' cars but I've never experienced this personally. They most likely fired the staff after that special aired.Unless you know someone, you usually have to have dinner as part of the package. Dinner will easily run roughly $30 per person. If you want dessert and drinks, expect to pay more. Good appetizers are the filet mignon steak tips, the fried calamari, the dungeness crab dip, and the garlic bread. For entrees, I usually get the Steak Milton although the Filet Mignon is pretty decent . Please bear in mind that if you're a steak purist, don't expect this to be comparable to Flemings or Maestros. Your dining experience will be better if you accept this reality beforehand. During dinner, a photographer will ask if you and your party would like your pictures to be taken. You can graciously decline but if you decide to purchase the picture(s), there will be a guest card inside as a added ""thank you."" I'm not sure if they still give a guest card when you purchase a picture but that was how it used to be last year. Also, during the Christmas holiday season, they have Christmas Carolers singing acapella to songs requested by the guests. After dinner, you will receive a ticket to the main show in the largest theater called the Palace of Mystery. It is first come, first serve (unless you know a staff member who will reserve you a seat) so if you are adamant about getting good seats, you should try and get to the Palace of Mystery early and wait until they allow admittance. Drinks can be ordered once you are inside so don't worry about getting drinks at the bar outside.After the main show, you can go to the smaller theater (the Parlour of Prestidigitation) located right next door to the Palace of Mystery or you may venture downstairs to the bar and billiards area where there is usually a performer doing pool tricks and miscellaneous magic. You also have the option to see magic up close and personal at the Close Up Gallery. If you are short on time, I highly recommend the Close Up Gallery as your next destination because the magic in that room has never ceased to amaze me. The magic there is all sleight of hand based which makes it that much more amazing.There are bars located everywhere so you can stay at the Magic Castle and be entertained for a good eight hours if you arrive for the earliest dinner slot. In summary, there is no place that I've been to that rivals the Magic Castle in terms of uniqueness and entertainment. It's great for special occasions and group settings. What's wonderful about it is that no matter how old you are, you will always feel like a little kid when you visit the Castle.",5 star rating
1749,4/19/2011,"2.5 stars, really.Here is my God's honest opinion about Magic castle. We came here for my sister's 30th birthday. She knows a member who got us all in. It is VERY pricey. Here is what we got for our money:Drinks- They did NOT skimp on the alcohol. I was pret-ty tipsy that entire evening. No complaints about that! Dinner- I ordered the Beef Wellington. The best part of that was the potatoes that came along side it. The beef wellington itself lacked flavor big time. Not at all worth the high price tag.Shows- I feel like we paid a lot of money too see a lot of card trick shows. Oh, and some slight of hand cup tricks. No real magic. That was a bummer!The best part of the evening? The bar with the magic piano! You ask the piano to play anything, I mean ANYTHING, and she'll do it! From Lady Gaga to the Beatles. She even played us a goodbye song as we were on our way out to one of the shows. That was the best. I had a good time because we were celebrating with people that I loved. We could have done that and had just as good of a time anywhere though. Overall a pretty underwhelming experience at this ""exclusive"" club.",2 star rating
1750,7/9/2013,"What a magical night! My bf surprised me for my birthday with an invitation for an evening at the Magic Castle. We spent close to 5 hrs there, exploring the bars, attending shows, had a wonderful dinner, and shared lots of laughter. I really enjoyed the evening and didn't want it to end. My favorite bar is the Owl Bar and my favorite show was the 10pm show held in the Palace. The acts are fun, daring, and mysterious. Please try the cocktail, ""Lovely Assistant"" it is so freakin' good!",5 star rating
1751,5/29/2015,I found the Magic Castle to be very confusing and slightly disappointing there was no showing we stood around for 45 minutes waiting to be seated for dinner we were ended up being sat late for dinner unfortunately this meant we missed the show we wanted to see and after ordering too much food we wanted to take it to go but wasn't clear on how to retrieve the meal :((,1 star rating
1752,9/22/2009,"I've gone here probably five or six times, which is quite a few considering I live in Phoenix.  It's a great alternative to the usual date night or a fun prelude to a night out.  I love that I get to wear fancy dresses here and I love the decor.  I highly recommend exploring as there are many hidden suprises.  It's best to go on a weeknight as it is much less crowded and the shows are more intimate.  I've had the pleasure of being asked to assist multiple times, which was always a sort of childhood fantasy of mine.  (geeky, I know).  The magicians can be hit and miss, but most of the shows I've seen have been nothing short of awesome.  My favorite of all time was The Unholy Three- absolutely hilarious, with Zabrecky a close second.  Also check out David Minkin.  Although I've never seen him perform a proper show at the castle, he's entertained me in hallways and at parties numerous times and I owe him for heckling him and trying to steal his table. I've only tried the appetizers here, and they are forgettable- I would advise saving your money and eating before or afterwards.  Also, there is no smoking patio as far as I know (I don't smoke, but my friends do, and I can tell you that the ambiance outside by the dumpster is slightly lacking, and not to mention Very Chilly if you are wearing a cocktail dress) If you haven't been yet, Go go go!",5 star rating
1753,7/10/2011,"Great entertainment for a night...I highly suggest that you come at least once in your lifetime (if you like to see magic).We didn't get dinner here because i heard it was just mediocre and really expensive.Lots of rules to follow before arriving - guys must wear a full suit and tie, ladies must wear a nice dress.Somebody in your party has to have a membership - which is running for $100/month (you get 2 entrances free every day in that month).Everybody else in that party pays $25 entrance fee.Valet is the only way to park at $8.No picture taking inside.21+ only.We went on a Saturday night and it was packed!We didn't get to watch 2 main shows because they reserve seats for dinner people first.Expect alcoholic drinks to be around $12/pop.We did watch a couple of side shows and a 2 big shows.I was highly impressed and some tricks left me thinking ""how is this possible?""Not the David Copperfield or Chris Angel type tricks but expect lots of card tricks, comedy, and magicians interacting with the crowd.",5 star rating
1754,7/31/2016,First time there. I had the lamb and it was great. It's a bit pricey. Cost entrance fee + parking of $73 for four people.

1756,6/30/2013,I want to go again. Someone please invite me back. I had been wanting to visit this place ever since I moved to LA four years ago and I finally got in. It really is a magical castle. I met some magicians that frequent the place and one of them even drew my portrait while I was at their bar eating their signature chili. It was really good chili. The magicians I met were really friendly and really treasure the place. There is a lot of memorabilia on the walls which you can read for hours. I didn't eat dinner there but the bars make pretty good drinks. They have a strict dress code and everyone at the castle looked fantastic and classy. I hope I can go again soon.,5 star rating

1759,4/18/2015,"By far one of the worst places ever! I don't even know where to start. The food is just awful. You would get better quality probably at some chain crappy restaurant like Applebee's or worst except that at those restaurants you'd only spend a fraction and have lower expectations going in. So after we were all disappointed with our gross, salty, dry, chewy foods (we were a party of 8 so we had ordered a lot of food) we were thinking that the ""magic show"" would wow us. But no! The magic show was surprisingly even worst then the disgusting dinner. Just think something you would see at a kindergarten- it was that bad. It was so bad it was ridiculous. They require men to wear suits and women to wear a dress not because the place is fancy or anything it's because it's filled with your grandparents and their friends! All and all, we spent approx $300 per couple and came home hungry and extremely disappointed. Lastly the place is sooooo old it smells like mold and dirt.

1763,11/15/2008,"Yippee! We finally made it over to the Magic Castle last night! I won a VIP guest pass and a gift certificate from an auction about 3 months ago and decided it would make  an excellent birthday present for my beloved boyfriend. The entrance fee was waived, hence the VIP status on the card, and we didn't have to pay much else except for alcohol-Which was a little steep-$10 for mediocre drinks. I did some yelping before going so I knew the food wasn't going to be great. But here it is anyway:Appetizers: Artichoke Hearts: OkayGarlic Bread : Needed Cheese or somethingMain Course:Veggie Dish (Spinach ravioli): OkayLobster tail: Good, I thought. Boyfriend said ""It tastes like ocean."" BIG ASS Steak: Okay, but definitely not worth the pricePotatoes Au Gratin (AKA: French Fried Sweet Potatoes) DisappointingDessert:Chocolate Souffle with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream: HELL'A GoodService: EXCELLENT!All in all we spent $120.00 on food. I wanted to max out the $150 gift certificate but I didn't want to feel like a fat cow. Oh well.As for the show:Magic show was fun. I forget how much magic makes me giggle. I felt like I was five years old even though everyone around me was like 60. I don't remember the magician's name but his girl's name was GINGER LEE. There was lots of audience participation which made it even more fun. My only gripe is that it's hard to see if you sit anywhere past the first five rows and we were sitting in the 7th or 8th row.After the main show, we stumbled into the Close-up gallery, and the two magicians we saw were just so much freaking fun! Phil Van Tee was the first-Great card tricks. The second guy was a ventriloquist. He came out with a little lamb first and then with a creepy little doll tied up to a mini-lawn chair. Both of his acts were GREAT! The Magic Castle would get 5 stars but for the way overpriced food. It's not bad food, it's just that at those prices it should be better.

1765,2/21/2010,"This place sets itself up for disappointment by being exclusive and requiring elegant attire. I was expecting The Illusionist, the Prestige... just one defining moment of aw to give reason for the $25 cover and enforced dinner. I was highly disappointed. Driving up I think everyone asks themselves how the hell they never noticed this place right behind Hollywood Blvd. Castle? They actually had stones painted onto the walls as murals. The ceiling was leaking. Everything needed to be repainted, a lot of the floors were a bit uneven with open drains showing in corners.Valet $8 right up front, entry $25 cash only, coat check available. No photography anywhere but the lobby, which made all the women who had spent an hour getting ready and digging up an ""elegant"" dress a bit annoyed. I thought maybe this was to preserve the secret of the magic I was about to see...Magic? Card tricks. I saw so many card tricks. I know how to do card tricks, I had a family friend who taught me a couple. It was boring then and tedious now. 1 or 2 to warm up I expected, but ALL damn night.Dinner... meh. Lobster bisque, shrimp cocktail and truffle fries were all ordinary and fine, nothing excitable. We were on time for our seating but seated so late and served so slowly we were rushed over to the big show and forced to skip dessert. Lovely. The show... Ice and Mystina. Cheesy, odd, anticlimactic. Not one good trick, not one. All tiny parlor tricks with trick props. Small ones. Note to magicians, small props on stage are underwhelming. Ice was sweating and sniffling within seconds onstage... Mystina had a trick which ended with something being changed into a cat, the cat looked horrified and frightened, and immediately tried to claw Mystina's face when she lifted it out of the tiny cage. Animals are not for our entertainment, especially not cheesy bad entertainment. The cat was probably just embarrassed to be a part of the act... odd random dance moves included. I was happy when it ended...We sat for a close up magic show right before leaving. Seating was ridiculous, I couldn't see anything at all, I sat for 30 minutes half attempting to watch yet another card show around some guys fat freaking head. Seating should be done according to head size. I was getting claustrophobic and falling asleep, when the doors opened and we were finally released. I was ecstatic to head home.2 stars because the place really was unique and had good strong cheap drinks, but I wont be back.",2 star rating

I was worried it would taste too gamey but I tried a piece and it was actually pretty good! Wow! It's hard to go through all the shows so make sure you check the schedule and pick out the ones you want to see for sure and make those a priority.  The place is a maze!!!  But it's definitely worth the trip up there and the wait.  Bars on every floor/area so you won't have an empty glass for long!  They even serve drinks in the auditoriums also by a waitress walking around.  Magic is sooooo cool!!!  At any age. We went during the week where the top kids performed their magic acts on stage.  They were AWESOME!!  The ambiance is dimlit antique style with a flair of early 1930s I think.

We wondered around the other rooms and watched some shows before they started.. I guess the magicians do solo shows to practice during show breaks.. anyhow all the shows were really great and the 730PM show or whenever it was in the main hall was superb! The old guy who was the magician really out did himself. He did some card trick with help of 3 people in the audience and then threw the cards in the air and used a sword to catch them!. The three he caught were the three that the audience chose!OH as far as dinner it was ok!  Very quick salad and appetizer service.. The dinner was ok.. nothing really to write home about.. The service was a bit off (MINUS 1 star) and even inquired.. the GM stated our server has been with the Castle for 3 years!..

I called ahead of time to ask if you could order two appetizers as a replacement for the overpriced entrees. What I should have asked is if this included the soups and salads. Nope, just the garlic bread, fries, calamari, etc. I'm not really one for oily food, so I wasn't very pleased. Instead I spent over $30 on alright seabass, extremely watery sweet potato puree and bland vegetables. As it was youth week, I was able to watch the performances of the Castle's young magicians.

I can't tell you that they're all good.  You can probably fit about 5 shows in an evening and each week, they have different magicians (some better than others) so it's hard to say if they're good or not.  For the most part, they're absolutely fantastic (like when Gazzo was there, my goodness!).  But then there was that one guy who did balloon animals... wtf?!  I mean, yeah it's cool and maybe nobody else can do them like you can but this isn't magic!  I wanted my time back!Also, I would, for the most part, skip the big stage performances... they're usually really cheesy.  The best ones are in the parlours and done in small groups.  Once you see all the scheduled performances, you can go down to the little hidden areas where magicians will hang out and do some tricks for you... those are usually the coolest!The place itself is pretty cool.  I wish it was a little bigger and had more ""hidden"" areas but still, it's fun to roam around.  Oh, go to the piano bar to meet their resident ghost pianist Irma.  Bring some dollar bills to offer her ghost bird and request a song...

It's not as mysterious as I imagined it even though I've seen pics of it. Parking is valet.  We entered the building and waited a bit to pay for our entrance.  The hostess told us to walk to the bookcase and say the secret word.  It's really not a secret word if she tells us.  I know that people have said it in the reviews but I wished I didn't know so that it would be part of the mystery.  I have to say that the magicians that performed that night were B++.  We watched 2 great magicians who did amazing card tricks.   The others that we watched were not impressive at all.  It was a bit comical too.  For dinner, the food was great.  I ordered the regular prime rib cut and it was a good size.  It was cooked perfectly too.  My other guests ordered the Filet Milton and the Beef Wellington.  We ordered a side of sauteed mushrooms and calamari to share.  The mushrooms was delish!  The entrees were definitely pricey.  Prices ranged from $25-$44, I think.  Overall, it was a fun night.  The food was good, the acts were decent and it definitely took me out of LA and into a different world.  If you go, remember that you'll have to get dressed up and expect to pay a lot for dinner if you order their entrees.",4 star rating
1779,8/5/2010,"Reviewed by Christopher S.I believe in magic.No, I'm not a Hogwarts dropout, nor do I dabble in the black arts.  The Force doesn't run strong in my family; I can make a Lego minifigure levitate, but I do it with an electromagnet, a photodiode and an L.E.D.The magic in which I believe is the magic of illusion; the magic that comes from descending into a basement and feeling, for a moment, that you are in an English pub.  The magic of velvet curtains and and chandeliers and hand carved wood and stained glass is combined in such a way as to convince you, for just a moment. that you aren't a couple of blocks away from peep shows and tourist traps and people from the middle America taking pictures of a sidewalk.The magicians were genuine showmen; I saw quite a few at my time at the Magic Castle.  Most of the tricks were the types that magicians have been performing for over a century, but classics never get old.  The levitating table, the rope and knot tricks, the making bunnies and doves appear out of nowhere...these are all well performed illusions that keep children wide eyed and adults whispering ""Okay, how did he do that?""  Even their appearance was often in character; I swear I saw Lucius Malfoy walk by, with his long, straight silver hair flowing down his back.This illusion was accompanied with a brunch buffet.  As far as buffets go, it wasn't bad.  But I certainly would not spend the $40 on the merits of the food that was served, though, the waffles were surprisingly acceptable.  And, as if by some sort of magic, the champagne kept flowing very generously...to the delight of a certain teacher.  I would certainly love to go back one evening and enjoy that subterranean pub when it's open.  L.A. is full of hidden gems, but to find this cross between the Museum of Jurassic Technology and Disneyland, and to find it in my childhood neighborhood...that takes some real magic.",5 star rating
1780,5/3/2011,"So as an out-of-towner, I didn't understand why my boyfriend was so stoked that he snagged passes to this place. After spending an awesome night there....it totally makes sense. Our night started out with dinner. The service was great, and our waiter was friendly and accommodating. The menu is very meat-heavy, but there was a vegetarian ravioli option on the menu. Tip to vegans and picky vegetarians - there is an off-menu vegan option, which I ordered. It was a delicious gumbo, with just the right amount of spice. After seeing the desserts at the table next to me, I really wish I had saved room for a slice of cake. It looked delicious! I hate to say it, but the main magic show of the evening was mediocre. It reminded me of something you might see at a child's birthday party. There was, however, one magician who worked with marionettes, which was by far my favorite act.Following the main show, we checked out the close-up show. It was AMAZING. My mind is still completely blown- I've been trying to figure out how the magician did one trick for the last two weeks. Be sure to get to that show at least a half hour early to secure a seat- our showing filled up about 20 minutes before it started, and they don't let you hold places in line for others. We saw another magician doing card tricks at a table in a hall- I'm blanking on his name, but he too, was fantastic and had a very engaging personality and lots of fun stories about hanging out with Sinatra. My biggest complaint about this place is that it was FREEZING. Guys- you'll be just fine, since you need to wear a coat and tie. Ladies - bring a pashmina, anorak, mink stole, poncho, whatever- just something to cover your inevitably freezing arms and shoulders. Brr!",4 star rating
1781,4/24/2009,"Hilarious, interesting, unique, entertaining... magical!The Magic Castle bring together cookey Hollywood and real-David Copperfield-leveled magic together in one! My husband and I went with some Life-Time members so we didn't have to pay an arm and a leg to get in (actually they paid for us, and I think it totaled to $25 each). Totally worth whatever they spent, as we had the kind of night where our smiles were infectious and contagious. My favorite part of the night was when the 99-year-old magician (the cookey part of the place) asked me to join him onstage and hold a rope for him as he ""magically"" untied it. Not only did I see every move he made to ""undo"" the knot, but so did the audience. Hilarious.After a few (expensive) drinks and listening to the invisible woman play the piano (that chick must have attended Julliard), we went into the deeps of the beautiful yet mysterious basement to see two VERY impressive shows, one a pure magic show and the other a PIMPED OUT card show. I think the magician at the later was hitting on me, and if he wasn't wearing a Kangaroo hat over a black bandanna over his greasy long ponytail and measuring at a freakish 7-feet in height, it might have been a more relaxing show. If you go and want to see one of the main shows in the Magic Castle's theater's while you are there, either be sure to book dinner tickets (which include admission to the large shows) or get in line EARLY ON. Thankfully I have a mad wink about me and performed some magic of my own to get into a show.",4 star rating

Food was decent and good but now on to the magicians ....me and my bf went on a Sunday to celebrate my bday!! And it was a bday to remember..wasn't too packed so we got to see all the different magic shows..and guess what i got to be a part of a couple of them,,,yes I was effen drunk..couldn't remember my lines ....but who cares it was my bday biotch!!!..... And Irma she's a blast me and my bf were to embarrassed to say ""can u play **** Irma"" cuz who the eff were we going to talk to, do we walk towards her, do we just yell it ...how the eff do we do this lol.....so we whispered it like idiots and thought oh I guess she doesn't know that song cuz she didn't play it ....might I add we were the only ones in the room...so we sat there most likely looking like idiots ..finally some older men's came in and said out loud ""can u play shout Irma"" ...me and the bf looked at each other and said oh that's how u do it ....that's when we started shouting out songs like no other! The castle is awesome and there is so much to look at...we stood till it closed and even got to go in a room where the person who takes pics of u and ur guest (for a fee if u want to purchase them) since we didn't spot him to the end and asked if he could take a pic of us...told us a lot of interesting stories as we waited, he even gave us a ticket with a code to make reservation for next time! Can't wait to come back!",5 star rating
1783,6/30/2008,"I think that the novelty of the Magic Castle has worn off.  I've been 4 times now, and each time I was less impressed.  A few things of note:1. Cover charge for guests has increased to $25.  They don't tell you that until you hand over your credit card.2. Valet parking has increased to $8.3. The main stage hosts only ONE performer now.  It used to be THREE!  I really felt ripped off!  When I went on Saturday, it was this lam-o Chuck Jones & Co. act that looked like it should have been at a 5-year-old's birthday party.  We could see how he did every trick, and he had these amateur boxes that he put his assistant in and he would ""magically"" slide swords through it.  Really his magic was just so cheesy.4. They now assign numbers for each seat in the close-up gallery.  If you don't get a number, you're out of luck.  Also, it seems that the clientèle of the castle has dwindled a bit... there were a ton of really drunk, heckling, belligerent people in some of our shows and they were EXTREMELY annoying.  It would be best probably to come on a Friday or even a weekday when other magicians go.I wish I had written my review after the first time I visited.  Oh well, it was still fun on Saturday, but I think that I understand why my friend is no longer a member.",4 star rating
1784,6/1/2009,"This is def. one of those ""to do"" things for your bucket list- esp. if you live in/ around LA. What an amazing experience! Everything I would hope it would be. I went with a small group of friends (6) of us for the 930 show. It was perfect. Put in a little effort and dress up- you and could even get away with being extra glitzy or having some funky fashion- forward flair. The crowd around that time was pretty young and cool which added to the experience. We started out with some drinks at the bar making their ""enchanted piano"" per from any song we could think it would possibly not know including some Britney spears and Micheal Jackson.- the drinks are LA priced so think $12 range depending on your poison. It was a fun gathering room to get ready for the night. Just looking around the place and taking in the history with a cocktail in hand was worth it. But then you move onto the shows. Our group found no problem getting seating together for the shows- even in the smallest rooms we were able to fit in. The magicians were funny and personable and talented. I just wouldn't wait until the very last minute to walk into a room because you will end up sitting in a back corner and poss. missing some of the ticks in the smaller parlor. I got to be on the main stage and had rings swooshed around me as i floated and i still have no clue how the heck he did it. My friends asked if i felt anything after and i honestly couldn't. I loved it! The food was good- i got some kind of meat specialty dinner with 3 or 4 different types of animal and it was REALLY REALLY good. I don't eat meat anymore but for you carnivore folk- it was def. worth the price [it was expensive tho- no lie] the atmosphere was great, the show was great, the food was great all in all an amazing place to visit at LEAST once in your lifetime.",5 star rating
1785,12/9/2009,"ABOUT THE NEW MENUThe food is MUCH improved, but, again, you're not coming for the food, so don't get your panties in a bunch about it. It used to be institutional grub, so the fact it's pretty good is a big deal. However, there are highlights --The appetizer menu is the strongest part of the menu, I've found (which is a good thing). The portobello mushroom fries are very good, the crab cakes are solid (lots of crab), the french fries are okay, the calamari (when I had it) was good, though I've heard mixed things about this from other people. The fries are okay. People seem to love the deviled eggs, but I can't stand boiled eggs, so I didn't try. The oysters looked good. As always, the chili's a good choice.AVOID the lobster mac and cheese, as it's super fishy tasting. The creamed spinach is tasty (although I'd love it with some bacon, umm!) and the fish was solid (got the special of the day, so won't dwell lest it never reappears). So go, eat and enjoy. And as an aside -- DON'T BE THE A-HOLES WHO GET DRUNK AND SAVE SEATS, because someone will find a manager, you will have to give up those seats, and you will be publicly embarrassed (seen it happen). And if I am there, I will laugh at your jerky ass. Seriously, there are signs EVERYWHERE telling you to 1) not save seats and 2) not save places in line. DON'T DO IT. You're a GUEST IN A PRIVATE CLUB (because members don't do that shit -- because magic is a small, small world). Behave your damn selves!",4 star rating

Lucky for the guys, jackets are mandatory.Other than feeling like I'm in cryogenics, this place had charm and intrigue. In one evening my group managed to watch 3 shows and in two of them, there were drunk hecklers. That's the one thing I don't appreciate. Everyone's dressed formally so it would be great to have respect and a great attitude towards the magicians, but unfortunately, not everyone thinks that way. In one room when the magician tried to guess which hand the coin was in, the lady flipped him off. Uncool & so immature.In the other room, a loud, drunk woman made inappropriate comments. With class and wit, the magician retorted back, ""If you're going to heckle me, make sure you annunciate!""",4 star rating
1787,7/9/2008,"incredible.The Castle never lets me down. this week we got ""Goldfinger and Dove"" as the main headliners. they were quite possibly the worst magicians i've ever seen. it was amazing. google them and you'll see why. i loved every second.the food...waaaay better than i remembered it. i had lobster bisque, mixed greens salad, spicy garlic shrimp, and artichoke hearts. all of it was good. the rest of the table loved their steak and prime rib. tell the waiter its someone's birthday and ""the wizard"" comes out with a cake for you. DO NOT FORGET. our entire table was crying and drooling with laughter. the ""wizard"" is really something else.my favorite part...there are bars EVERYWHERE!!!! so go get annihilated and stumble around into the little magical theaters. or sit at the bar and don't leave...there's usually magicians hanging around that will do magic for you right there.Although you can't see her, go visit Irma in the parlour...",5 star rating

Once we got inside, it was pretty clear, it's really a ""magic castle""! What a beautiful, old building decorated in Victorian theme, with different rooms, bars, theaters, and cubbies where you can be entertained by all types of skilled magicians. We had dinner and it was delicious- filet mignon, wedge salad, lobster tail, 2 beers and a Coke came out to $120. Not too bad considering the ambience! Everyone dresses to impress. Cocktail dresses and suits are a must, making the experience feel even more exclusive. It was a great visit! From 6pm-1am, we were able to see a variety of shows and got to explore the castle. I would recommend everyone go at least once! That is IF you can get invited :) Thanks to the person who got us in for my birthday! It was pretty awesome!",5 star rating

With the help of a kind Yelper, I was able to score a pass and take my parents for an evening that ended up being the highlight of their trip! The evening started with magic and mystery from the moment we stepped in the door. We had dinner reservations for 8pm but got there around 6:30 to have drinks and catch a couple of shows before dinner Our main Parlor show (guaranteed with dinner) was at 10.  That sched worked great and we could have stayed late into the night to watch shows in the smaller rooms (had the 'rents been able to stay up!). The staff was friendly and helpful and the vibe in the place was relaxed and warm. There are a bunch of little things all around the castle that are sure to make for a memorable evening. Listing them all out here would take away from the fun so I'll let you explore yourself.  The dinner was so-so but since that's not the attraction so it's totally fine and we didn't have to grab a midnight snack after or anything. Also, our party of 6 was mostly vegetarian yet we were still able to have a good meal from all the sides and main veggie dish (ravioli).

I literally didn't know where we were going until we pulled up, so I only researched it after. To be honest, when we pulled up, I was thinking that this was just going to be one of those things where you eat dinner while watching someone put on a magic show. Thankfully, it is nothing like that! It's a whole ""castle"" to explore and it really made me feel like we were in a different time period. It's also fun (to me) that you have to dress up formally.I really enjoyed all of the shows we watched throughout the different rooms of the castle. My jaw dropped a few times too! There's still some stuff that, to this day, I think ""How the heck did they do that?!""The magic and the castle definitely get 5 stars -- heck, 10 if I could give that many.

Period.I do like to dress up and hang out in strange mansions from time to time, and love to dine out in said dress-up clothes and mansions with friends as well.Open Sesame, Irma the Piano Lady, and up close prestidigitation - I LOVE that word - this is why you come here. It's all about the show.The first time I came here - many years ago in fact - it was novel. I think I was so in awe of my surroundings that I ignored the fact that my food was just so so. I just remember having lots of fun, dressed up with my posse (use of that word alone should let you know just how long ago that first visit was), having drinks and being entertained. I think I had the underwhelming, overpriced steak, and I remember that the horseradish was good. My second, more recent visit was made all the more memorable by the magic trick they played with my food. There I was sitting down to enjoy an overpriced pasta dish and - VOILA! - like magic, a metal STAPLE, of all things, just kind of ended up in my food! As you can imagine, I had a really hard time, er, holding it together...not coming unglued...insert bad staple joke here.So attentive was the management and wait staff that they brought out what they thought was the offending pasta box, showing me it's intricate construction and how a staple might make it's way onto my plate.I think they made the charge for my meal disappear, which was right decent of them.

I don't mind spending $25 to get a tour of this place and to see the random show. I had a private tour from a magician who worked there. He told us some pretty interesting stories.

C+Shrimp scampi had really great prawns (the big shrimp).  Nicely grilled and still juicy.  Pasta was the really flat wide kind.  Egg noodle kind of?  Tasted fresh.  Sauce was okay, a bit lemony but  still good.  Portion was a bit smallish.  B+Entrees comes with salad.  Pretty good/typical.",4 star rating

The shows themselves were good, but more geared towards children because the brunch shows allow anyone to come, unlike the dinner show that requires you to be 21 or over.

You must try the award winning chili as appetizer. We also ordered the portobello fries and liked it.The free salad was nice with house salad dressings.For entrees, we ordered prime rib, lamb rack, New York steak and snapper (special of the day). The medium-cooked lamb was amazingly delicious. New York steak was awesome too. Only the snapper was a little disappointing as it smelt very fishy.Our server Chris was super nice and fun. He even served us complimentary champagne to celebrate the 2 soon-to-be married couples. After the dinner, he helped us to secure a private show with a magicians he ran into. 5 star service!We ended up spending $50/person.Castle:The castle looks like an old church, which is a little disappointing, but the inside is pretty spacious, dark and mysterious, which suites the magical theme well. There are 3 stories for you to explore. You can basically get alcohol anywhere in the building as there are bars and waitresses walking around to serve.Shows:There are a lot of scheduled shows, and you should check their website for the details.The 2 scheduled shows we saw are awesome! Way better than the Criss Angel - Believe rip-off we saw at Vegas, which we paid $70+. However, we liked the intimate ""impromptu"" shows in the hallway more, where magicians randomly perform to small crowds. You could see the performances up close (even see their tricks although you should not) and interact with the magicians. We especially enjoyed the private show by the magician Alfonso (I think) that our server arranged for us.

They are great even if sometimes the jokes are a little corny the ventriloquist was my absolute favorite. Cons Members only club so find someone wonderful on yelp who is a member who may even send you an invite if they are awesomeEven if you get a invite you still have to pay like 20-25 per person, plus like $8 parking, plus dinner which also isn't cheap so save this for a special occasionRecommendations You must dress nicely but there were a couple of extremes. Some were in formal floor length dresses and others a knit summer dress so it seems they aren't as strict for women. Also they let men borrow a tie at the front as long as they leave their drivers license. Which is very nice. Seemed a little cool inside so bring a light jacket or sweater.  If you want to get picked on by the magicians sit in the front.

First off, expect this place to be a little cheesy and so just go with the flow.  The decor is somewhat tired and needs updating and/or cleaning but it's the showmanship that you're there for.  Everything, from the upclose tricks, to the more elaborate presentations is utterly engrossing and mind-blowing.  I really did not expect to be surprised and yet I was, time and again.  When a Swedish magician made his assistant disappear after swooshing some chiffon in front of her, my jaw dropped.  I felt like a little kid again, full of wonder and glee.  By the night's end, I felt like I went back into childhood and I left surprisingly more lighthearted, if that's possible.I'm not sure how others take to a prospect of ""magic"" but I would say this is definitely to be tried by anyone who hasn't been here before.  Magic Castle is most certainly not your standard run of the mill, garden variety nightspot.",5 star rating

They made me put on their shawl as requirement for entry and stated that I should have came in dress code. ....Ummm, maybe the backwoods staff didn't understand what an ""evening pant suit ensemble"" looks like???????FOOD: overpriced for merely edible.SHOW: good but not impressive.OVERALL: $250 for mediocrity.",1 star rating
1820,5/26/2014,"First off, I'd like to say that when I went to the Magic Castle 10 years ago, it was amazing!! I would give them 5 stars all the way around!! But 8 of us went there last night and the only 5 stars I'd give would be towards the food and a few of the small side shows.  Last night the main shows were HORRIBLE!! I guess it was ""Japan night"" and all the performers did beginner tricks and even did them horrible. It was more of a comedy, then a magic show.  I asked to even see the manager, but never met him.  We were all very disappointed!",1 star rating
1821,4/23/2011,"I've been here a handful of times, and each time is better than the last! With that said, I've never been here for a sit down dinner (save for watching Neil Patrick Harris & Max Maven chow down for an episode of Top Chef). I've been here just to see shows and drink at the bar. The decor is fun and kitschy the minute you walk in the door, I love it. Secret password required for entry, check. Invisible piano player, check. Classy dressed folks abound, check. Even the legendary Dai Vernon's ashes are interred here! There's multiple bars around, and magic performed at each one... The drinks are not cheap, but I enjoy the ambience enough to not care about the price (especially since I don't eat dinner here). The structure of the building is by no means easy to remember, hell I've been here 5+ times and I still forget. There's big parlours for magic, close up galleries... the works. I've brought friends here before and they loved it- I can always count on the Castle for a good night! :)Dress code is strictly enforced. Visit their website for details. Valet parking only, and it's $8. If you are interested in seeing one of the shows on the program, you should line up at least 20 minutes beforehand. Some rooms like the Close-Up Gallery and the Parlour of Prestigitation fill up quickly. One thing that annoys the hell out of me are the people standing there ""holding spots"" for a party of 8. So even though you think you will get into the show, you might not because of these people... line up early. If you miss getting into a show, roam around the castle... you'll often find some impromptu magic being done in a smaller room. And keep it classy people, there's nothing more annoying than an obnoxious, completely smashed person at a magic show!",5 star rating
1822,10/3/2010,"We're definitely going back!A few tips:1.)  Men:  you're hosed from the start because you have to wear a jacket at all times--wear the lightest jacket possible because the Castle can get too warm at times especially in small venues.  Ladies, short dresses or at least something sleeveless.  At times I was dying in my long formal.2.)  Come early!  Like, 5 pm early!  This way you can check out everything!!!3.)  Chat it up with the members there, they can give you pointers with really neat things to check out.  Be sure to check out Irma on the ground floor.  Oh ya, there's a cute phone booth to check out (nothing scary) near Studio 31.4.)  Don't bother bringing in your camera (that kinda sucks) and keep that cell phone SILENT.Alright, on to the actual experience:Valet--8 bucks up front.  Meh, we had worse.   If you don't want to chuck out the cash for valet this is probably not the place for you because 8 bucks was about the cheapest thing lolFront desk (check-in):  polite and promptFood:  my food was perfectly fine.  I shared with the table my sweet corn ravioli (with a vanilla saffron sauce) and I had for my main course the salmon with risotto.  Okay--it's not the BEST thing I've had ever but it was good.  Okay, the risotto may have been a little too mushy but risotto for the masses is not an easy task and it wasn't THAT bad.  Yes, it was expensive for what you got but......actually I have no justification for this one--it's just expensive.   I had no room for dessert.  Ah yes, a friend of ours had the infamous lobster bisque and he too said it was too salty.  Avoid that bisque like the plague.On to the performances:We got really lost and I didn't catch some of the performers names.  Basically we got to see every performance, which was AWESOME.  I have to be perfectly honest--the guaranteed show (at Studio 31) you get with your dinner was just okay.  God, I feel like I'm going to go to magic hell for saying that but the venue was HOT and the performance was kinda dull.  The magic was pretty good but the presentation had too much dialogue.  The close-up room was the highlight of the evening.  Johnny Ace Palmer gave one hell of a show--it was so good I would have stayed in line for another 30 minutes just to see him again.  His tricks were AMAZING.Everything else we saw there was fantastic--I can't do their names justice at all, sadly.  :(Libations:  expensive but strong, one was plenty for me!!Ambiance/cleanliness:  bathrooms were totally up to snuff, not dirty.  The feel of this place is just....magical.  :)Overall, we had a great time--we left at 1:00 a.m. and I didn't really want to go!  This place is very expensive but to me, worth it.",5 star rating

1824,6/5/2011,"A very classy place to go!  The attire is very formal, so don't dress cheap if you're going!  My boyfriend surprised me and took me here for our anniversary.  Prior to going to the Magic Castle I had heard nothing about it... that was probably the best way because I really did not know what to expect.The close up magic shows are amazing and very entertaining.  You could literally be sitting right next to the magician and he will blow your mind and make you believe in magic.The Magic Castle consists of a bunch of different stories (I think 3??) that are decked out with pictures of magicians and castle-like decor.  It seemed that everywhere we walked within the castle had a bar just around the corner.  Needless to say I got quite tipsy. :) I kept having to tell myself to keep it cool, especially since it's not the place to get sloppy drunk.Since I was pretty tipsy I thought it would be a good idea to have some mac and cheese and onion rings for dinner.  lol.  I'm a vegetarian, and I didn't like the other options at the time.  My dinner was perfect drunk food, just super pricey for what I ordered.  My not-as-drunk-as-me boyfriend got the filet mignon.  He said it was amazing and perfectly cooked--I'll take his word.  The staff was very courteous as well.I ordered hendrix gin with st. germaine and club soda all night--try it.

1825,2/16/2011,"If I were just rating this on the fun we had, it would totally be FIVE STARS!But, considering the following, I felt I should tone it down a notch:It's ridiculously expensive if you plan on just going one time: $100 for the open sesame membership (which gets you unlimited entry for 30 days) plus dinner, plus drinks.But, WAY COOL swanky fun and the cocktails are strong.   We felt we got our money's worth of entertainment for FIVE, yes 5, HOURS.    But, the initial cost kinda outweighs The magicians aren't doing any super crazy, mind-bending pranks or anything, but their routines are solid, basic tricks that are chock full of comedy.  Seriously, it's more like going to a comedy show ABOUT magic rather than a super-serious ""this is my craft and i will totally mystify you"" show.  We left each show with several ""how'd-they-do-thats?"" The rooms are intimate which allow the crowds to really share in the laughter; i'm sure the super strong drinks help the camaraderie.I'm not sure magic is the main draw for most of the open sesame (one-timers) members.  I would say most would pay the money to go to the Magic Castle once.   It is a classic staple of Hollywood,  so you should try to see it on a special occasion to justify the expense. It is a FUN, something-different kinda date place.  Just bring your wallet and have fun with it.",3 star rating
1826,7/22/2015,"Went to the magic castle with my family and wow the food has improved amazingly! We ordered both types of the bisque they had and they were both delicious.  We also tried their stuffed mushroom and their crispy pork belly appetizers and they were both great, the crispy pork belky was my favorite of the two. I ordered their filet mignon with dungeness crab and they cooked it to a perfect medium rare.  Thanks to our server Celina, we tried all her recommendations for drinks and they were all really good, I especially liked the rumchata and their blood orange margarita. Celina was great, very fun and took extremely good care of us.  She was so right about the lobster which was probably the most delicious lobster I've ever tasted. Loved the eating experience and afterwards we saw an awesome show with Matt Marcy, Chris Randall, and Joseph Tran, all of whom were not just hilarious, but really good at their art.

1827,11/17/2009,"PROS: Food was delicious So many different rooms to see magic Friendly staff The Castle is decorated so well (it feels special) You get to say the magic words to get in and a hidden door opens for you The history of the castle is interesting. We went during Halloween and they had added fun decorations including a coffin filled with candy that you could help yourself to. Irma the ghost who plays the piano (even though she didn't know some of our songs). CONS: Expensive Main show was more circus than magic (pretty sloppy) I'm sure it would depend on who was performing but the magicians we saw weren't fantastic, mildly entertaining. This was such a fun experience, even if the magic wasn't outstanding, it was all in such a fun spirit. I could get lost in there, the home is so big.

All the magicians were entertaining and professional.  Once again, the theaters were beautifully decorated in castle decor.We were worried about dinner, since we are vegan.  I asked the waiter if he could make the one vegetarian item vegan.  No worries, the unadvertised vegan dish is curried noodles and vegetables.  We were brought a vegan salad of mixed dark leafy greens (no cheap iceburg) with cherry type tomatoes, purple onion, and cucumber, with a slice of lemon.  It was delicious.  Then we were brought the noodles and veggies.  They were amazing, and that is rare for an establishment that doesn't solely cater to vegans.  We were blown away at the food. Of course though, no vegan dessert, but hey, we were stuffed from the generous servings any way.We went to more shows, enjoyed some of the artifacts and the decor, the ghost piano was fun (plays any song you request) and the people working there were all very kind and helpful.It is a bit pricey and you are expected to dress up, which adds to the feeling of being somewhere fancy.  Overall, I would love to return and highly recommend it, especially to tourists.",5 star rating

1832,11/30/2010,"I've been hearing about the Magic Castle for years but for some reason though it would be cheesy. Then Robert C. brought me for a birthday surprise (he got a guest pass from a member friend of his). Without any time for preconceived ideas, he paid, put on his tie, and we went inside through the wall of books. We were in the Castle for at least three hours and I think my eyes were double their usual size the entire time. I felt a bit like Harry Potter when he first learned that he was a wizard and went to Diagon Alley to get his school stuff. It's a labyrinth of rooms decorated in Gothic velvets, chandeliers and knights' suits. Large paintings with eyes that move, a piano that plays itself, a staircase with carved banisters, the whole bit.There's so much to look at and everyone is dressed up so you forget where you are and what time period you're in. When we left, I seriously felt like I had been somewhere very far away and that never happens in Los Angeles! The magic show was phenomenal. These people are the best and they are real performers. Each act was completely unique and very entertaining. Every room has it's own bar but you can get food or drink anywhere as there are waiters walking around constantly. The food is hit and miss so check out other Yelp reviews to find out what's good. The wine was not so I'd stick to beer or hard liquor. We enjoyed the mac and cheese but the garlic bread was a bit soggy. Overall, the Magic Castle is a very special experience and everyone working there makes sure of it. Get a pass and go! They also open their doors to non-guest/members at times.",5 star rating
1833,1/21/2009,"I'm so glad my coworker is a magician! I finally got there last month and saw Ed Alonso (for those of you who saw Saved By The Bell - he was Max the restaurant owner). Two people from Heroes were there - the Japanese dude (Harold and Lloyd / Get Smart) and the new Spock. I actually didn't notice the new Spock but noticed Harold and the guy in front of me mentioned both of them where from Heroes.Walking around is great, there are all sorts of little rooms to check out, and a few bars to drink at. Yes, it's expensive, but HEY - you're at an exclusive castle...filled with magic! You have to be invited to go in there, and unless you have the VIP guest pass, it's $20 a head.In addition to being invited, they also have a strict dress code, but again, the entire evening is worth it - and make sure you get there early - so you can look around. When you have dinner reservations, you can get there after 5PM. no matter what time your dinner and show is at.I guess I should also mention that Ed Alonso and all the magicians around were excellent. They all had us stumped with their tricks.Technically - you can take a train there - as it's above Hollywood and Highland - but w/the dress code, your female date probably doesn't want to ride the redline all dressed up and walk up that hill w/high heels.",5 star rating
1834,2/23/2008,"The Magic Castle is a Hollywood Legend. A private club by invite only, you need to know someone who is a member to give you a guest pass.

Classes are offered at the castle.In the lobby of the enterance is an owl. Speak the secret password to the owl and the bookshelf slides open to the main bar of the castle. There are lots of waiting areas with old velvet chairs, patrons enjoy drinks as member magicians marvel them with simple card and coin tricks. Don't forget to visit Irma the ghost sitting at the Piano in the lower lobby. She will play almost any request, spooky!The dining area upstairs is very classy, tables are a bit crowded though and the food is just so so. But it's all about the ambiance, the history and of course the magic.The main stage show is very entertaining with different magicians performing nightly. I was blown away by the talent.

1837,7/2/2010,"After doing some research on the performing magicians of the night, my friend scored us 6 guest spots, free of charge, no paying off the magician either. No forced dinner as well--the food did look pretty terrible. (Although eating dinner will guarantee spots at the ""Palace of Mystery"" room.)Yes, the average age was nearing 55+ on a Thursday night, but doesn't matter, I never had so much fun at a magic show--it beats ever Copperfield, Siegfried & Roy, and Lance Burton show we dished out Franklins to watch. We arrived really early, around 5:30, and gave ourselves a mini tour of the castle before any of the shows began. By then, almost everyone was eating dinner or hadn't arrived yet so it wasn't too cramped. We planned our night well, starting off with the Close-up Gallery, which is a must and should be the first thing you try to do (the wait is usually an hour--it fits no more than 17 people at a time). We chatted it up with a few members of the castle or students and realized it's not too difficult to become a member and get in for free anytime along with 3 people. For 6 weeks, $250 total classes are offered. And they'll supply all the materials. I hear all one needs to do is audition to become a lasting member (I guess just to show you really care about this magic business), pay a small fee, and one is finally in! That certainly breaks the $6,000/year myth I've been hearing...Though getting back in will take a few strings, magicians are all around us, much more than you'll think!

1838,11/22/2010,"If this review were to only focus on the entertainment value at Magic Castle, it would be five stars. When it comes to having a uniquely good time in Los Angeles, I can think of just a handful of places more vibrant, fun and special than Magic Castle. Of course, most nights involve food and drinks, and this is where the place suffers.The night that I went there was a singing event downstairs. A vocal concert. It was entertaining for a bit. The bar menu here offered some pretty intriguing options, but the ones that we ordered fell flat. I tried the hamburger with a side of fries, and I also tasted the lobster mac and cheese. The latter was okay, a bit skimpy on the lobster and not as cheesy as I would have preferred, but by no means BAD. The burger, on the other hand, was pretty bad. You could tell the meat was probably not generic, frozen, store-bought fair, but the preparation and construction was poor. The pretzel roll was unnecessary. The dipping sauce for the fries was nice. As one Magic Castle member told me before I went there, ""Don't expect much from the food -- if it comes out good that'll be the best magic trick of the night.""Of course, the magic shows are top notch. And that's the essence of the Magic Castle, so this aspect of the place should be weighted much more heavily than the food. I couldn't believe what I was seeing in the castle's small parlors where 10-15 people can watch a performance up close and interact with the magicians. It was truly a one-of-a-kind opportunity. The only other detail that could make or break your trip to the Magic Castle will be the crowd. I've heard of people going there on nights when there is a big party that will ruin your ability to have a good time. When I was there it was pretty mellow and not too crowded, but I've heard horror stories of 21st birthday parties and corporate events that have left visitors disappointed. Good luck! Have fun!",3 star rating
1839,2/20/2015,"My wife and I along with five friends had a reservation in early February through another friend. Out dinner reservation was at 9:45p - a bit late. But this allowed us to split some of the magic shows before and after dinner. Be warned that you do have to dress appropriately, i.e. suits for guys and evening wear for the ladies. I do have to say the valet guys really are top notch with one of them noticing that I had my suit jacket on a hangar in the back seat and opening the door and getting my jacket to help me put it on. As other reviewers noted, before you even actually get into the main part of the ""castle"", you have to fork over $20 per person ""cover charge"" and $10 for valet, but I guess they have to gouge you somehow. We started off with a drink at the main bar downstairs. I was disappointed that they served Manhattans with crushed ice and the bartender did not use a shaker to make the drink but just poured directly into the glass, but I guess that's just my personal take. We saw two shows before dinner though there were a lot of people already milling around and around the various bars. If you want to see the shows at specific times, you have to get in line quickly as the rooms are small and, when they reach capacity, they will turn you away. The two shows were enjoyable especially the guy from London who was very entertaining. We then went to dinner. While the menu looked appetizing, in actuality, it was very disappointing for the price they were charging. I had the beef wellington and it was not warm and dry even with the accompanying jus. Following a disappointing and overly-priced dinner, we went to see the main show (you receive tickets if you have a dinner reservation, otherwise you are relegated to a different show). The opening show with another British magician was very entertaining though the two ladies from the audience was painful to watch. The other act with the elderly ""magician"" and his puppet/mannequin was just plain bizarre, boring, and a waste of time such that I took advantage and dozed off for a bit. The same goes for the second act with the same elderly ""magician"" with his female associate. After the main show, we decided to go home as it was already close to 1a and we did not want to risk sitting around and watching another disappointing show. It was our opportunity to cross this attraction off our list and also to keep it crossed off. The cost simply did not justify the quality of the food and shows as well as the amount of time spent.",2 star rating

1841,5/29/2009,"I was under-dressed.  Although,  I did see the pictures on their website and I did read about the dress code, but I didn't realize how fancy and glamorous they expected your attire to be!  My sister's friend dressed in what she described as a ""potato sack"" didn't have any trouble entering the premise.  Whereas,  I was dressed in casual business attire, slacks and a silk blouse, had to borrow one of their jackets.  Albeit, the jacket was a perfect fit and it added a certainly flair to my outfit; I was so tempted to forgo my driver's license for it had I not needed it for the weekend. So, best to overdress to an exclusive event like this where it's members and invitations only  - bleh.  Bring out the bling - fake or real!The place is like a labyrinth with multiple rooms, auditoriums and various opened areas where magicians were encouraged to perform their magic tricks.  We were there to see Henock Negash, a good friend of one of the acquaintances that got us in, and he wowed all of us with his card flipping, disappearing illusions.   Many of the magicians there are very talented, but don't expect anything over-the-top a la David Copperfield or David Blaine because I got a little carried away imagining what this ""mysterious and exclusive"" place was going to be like.",4 star rating
1842,2/12/2010,"It's probably best that I'm writing this review some hours after returning from the Magic Castle because it would be hard for me to restrain my enthusiasm otherwise. I've lived in the LA area my whole life and never once been to this old-school LA landmark. I finally did yesterday, and couldn't be happier with it.The new-ish executive chef has apparently completely turned around the menu, and made dining here a first-rate treat. The three-cheese garlic bread was enough to tempt me off my low-carb diet for the night, a transgression I repeated with the beef Wellington. Apparently long the Castle's signature dish, the Wellington was superb, as was the lobster bisque. My wife's Chef's Vegetarian Creation was devoured with gusto, and my in-laws had similarly positive things to say about their choices. We were lucky, and arrived early enough to get window seating from which we got a fine prospect of the Hollywood Roosevelt hotel and the street below.The Castle itself contains five bars, all of which are, like the Castle at large, at once charming and idiosyncratic in a shabby chic way. The magic shows themselves manage to fascinate and amaze, with performers you've probably never heard of from quite literally all over the world showing off skills you can't quite imagine until you see them. The overwhelming impression you take away here is that you've been brought into the living room of an elderly and once-very-wealthy uncle who used to be in Vaudeville, who now puts on private shows for  friends. Everything about the Castle radiates with the love the people there have for magic, and for the place itself. I have to admit to both feeling suddenly protective of it, and that it was in immensely good hands.",5 star rating

To be honest, at first i was a little worried cuz i dont know what to expect really. but once i got inside and started to observe the place, i must say, i grew to appreciate it! i started off with a long island ice tea..and that was the ONLY drink i NEEDED that night. i was buzzzing from the beginning! =) i love the fact that we can walk around the entire castle and watch shows while drinking alcohol. awesome.as for the magic shows, i always tried to figure it out., which was quite fun for me. =) whether i was way off or surprisingly close, i always payed close attention.. and then AHHHH-HA!!! I KNEW IT! hahaha Dinner was maybe 4 stars for me. nothing great about it. but the room that we dined in was pretty cool. it was a room dedicated to Houdini. it actually had real belongings from the famous Houdini displayed around the entire room So overall, including the dining  room experience, i would give it 5 stars.Basically, this place is awesome, fun, and memorable! if you ever get the chance to come and experience this place, you gotta do it and go! you wont regret it, promise!!!!",5 star rating
1845,7/31/2011,"Dinner: Rock shrimp on penne.~$30. Good individual portion, tasty. Shrimp was nice and juicy. Penne was cooked just right. Comes with a house salad. A very entertaining place over all. However, there is a line for all the shows. If you stay until closing, you might be able to watch 2-3 half-hour shows. I wished there were more magicians at the small tables all around the castle like before. It might be a better idea if they admit less people/ night, so everyone could fully enjoy this experience.Pricey event, strict attire. valet is $8.",4 star rating

1848,10/13/2012,"We raved about this place so much that our friends decided to go there for a birthday celebration and we were invited. Unfortunately it was not the same experience. The main show was REALLY BAD. There was virtually no magic, just some mediocre comedy. We also were unable to see anything in the downstairs parlors as the castle was too packed and we could barely squeeze in the room. We did see a show in the Teller theater that was pretty decent... (although we had seen 2 of the magicians from our last visit doing virtually the same tricks). The highlight of our night was the guy who cut paper into our profiles. It was pretty impressive. We ended up leaving early as the birthday boy was feeling sick... he thinks from the fish.  No bueno.",2 star rating
1849,2/6/2012,"I have been here several times and always had an amazing experience. Every magician was top notch and the food and drink was reasonably priced. When I went, guys were required to wear a jacket and tie and the vibe is toward upscale without being pretentious.Sadly I have lost my connections to get invited (a member moved away and an employee is no longer there.)  So I am also posting this review in the hope that some current magician/staff member/ or current member will ""friend"" me and get me an invite. One can always dream.",5 star rating
1850,6/19/2011,"Since being to the Castle a couple years ago, there have been major changes:  First, it's busier than I've ever seen it. Though Saturdays are often busy, this week was crazy!  There were long lines for shows, spending time with Irma the piano playing ghost was only fun for those who like to squeeze large groups into phone booths, and hallways were so jammed with loiterers and overflow from shows that movement was a challenge.  Next, I have to point out that the Castle has raised all of its prices, from parking to cocktails.  This is now a minimum $100 evening - it would be worth it had I not spent the night doing my best imitation of a tightly packed sardine.  The Castle used to have a reputation of having really bad food, though a new chef made that better for a long time.  Last night made me wonder if they've brought back the old chef because the food was mediocre at best.  Hiding bad cooking with sauces is a poor choice.  My medium rare prime rib was delivered with not a morsel of pink to be found - maybe they should add cooking classes to their academy.  Of course, most people go to the Castle for magic shows as it boasts appearances by some of the best magicians in the world.  Well, that's what the Castle says, anyway. As happens far too often, the performances in the large venues were just okay while those in the smaller venues were more entertaining and better performed.  I always hope to find a wandering magician looking to try out a new gag on a passerby - the downstairs areas used to be great for that, though shows are now being scheduled there as well.  I was in luck last night:  a guy who hopes to score a spot on the schedule was trying a couple things out in line for a show - he was as charming as he was skilled and was a highlight of the night.",3 star rating
1851,9/23/2009,"If you're lucky enough to get an invite from a member, please go, you won't be disappointed.Magic Castle is home to some of the biggest names in magic, and thankfully the largest room is probably 40+ people.  The close-up room in particular, will let you see some of the best slight of hand on the planet, mere feet from the illusionist.I've only dined here once, and the Beef Wellington was excellent.  Do yourself a favor: as the night winds down, head to the kitchen and get a bowl of chili.  It's absolutely fantastic.",5 star rating
1852,4/18/2011,"It has been over a week since my experience at Magic Castle and I think my jaw is still wide open. This was definitely an experience of a lifetime.Honestly...it would have been really really hard to ruin the night. I was with my lovely gf and 6 other very fun friends. Just the fact that we all got together and dressed up all fancy-like already made it a great evening. Friendly tip for all the alcoholics, if you want to be tipsy for this journey, make sure to get some drinks in before you get to the MC, simple drinks like a jack and coke or gin and tonic is $12 each in there. Although I do not support this...you could sneak a flask in pretty easily and just get a coke at the bar or something.Atmosphere was great in there. You get the old and mysterious vibe...like when a cougar is hitting on you at some bar. And no, I don't mean mid or late 20 something women who claim they are cougars just because they are not 21 anymore or they like guys who are 4 or 5 years younger than them. That is not a cougar. I'm talking about 40-50 somethings that you could see having brunch with your Mom, dressed up in a dress that is JUST a little bit too short for comfort. And the only reason you were looking at her was because you wondered if she knew she was the oldest person in this bar by 15 years and she notices you looking at her and then she walks over to talk to you. The way she talked to you, she gave you the feeling like she's done this thousands of times before, but you need to grab on to something because this is going to be one hell of an adventure for you.What was I talking about? The atmosphere. Yea, the atmosphere was exactly like that. Exactly. Alright, we did a close up show first. And this show was undoubtedly my favorite show of the night. We sat about 5 feet away from a man a couple decks of cards. I'm still amazed thinking about some of the tricks he did with those cards. I know it's all slight of hand, but half the time, I wanted to just stand up and say ""f this"" and leave, because it was just too much to take in. The rest of the night, I constantly checked that my wallet was still in my back pocket. These quick handed bastards weren't going to take my wallet. I can just see me checking, and the wallet wasn't there, I turn around, and there is that slight of hand magician with my wallet ""Looking for this sir? Well, I have magically turned your wallet into....100 vodka shots!!""""Yayyy!"" Everyone at the bar screamed.""NOOOO!!! Damn you magician!!!"" I cried.So yea, that didn't really happen though. Moving on to dinner. The rack of lamb was very good. The portabella mushroom fries were also very delicious. I looked around and it seemed like everyone at the table were satisfied with their meal. If I was just rating the restaurant, it would have been a 4 star, but this overall experience easily brought the rating up to a 5.We were worried because we had a ""main show"" to go to right after the dinner, and they were definitely taking their time getting our food out. But they actually held the start of the event to make sure we made it to the show on time. Nicely done, because if they rushed our nice dinner or started the show without us, our group was not going to be too happy.The main show was fun, but not amazing. It was very ""vegas"" styled. Big crowd, big stage. ""Gob-like"" illusions. I don't know, after the crazy close up shows, someone eating and blowing fire just didn't do much for me.Overall, an amazing experience. Something I wish I could do every weekend. The magicians and shows always change, so I feel like it could be a different experience every single time. Can't wait to go again!",5 star rating

1854,1/4/2010,"For my friend Tom's 30th birthday celebration his wife and good friend invited 13 of their closest friends to be part of a celebration that included entry to the infamous Magic Castle. I have to say it has been awhile since I've been part of such an entertaining and exclusive event. As entry is only available for those who are members/magicians or guests of members. You can be sure to make an evening to remember with dinner, three main theatres, bars at every level and corner of the castle, and magicians that seem to magically appear around every nook and cranny (make sure to stop by Bill Joslin's table, he was by far my favorite of the night)!

You can tell that the place was magnificent when it was built but the remodeling of the building for it's commercial use has destroyed some parts function and flow.I was the only one in our entourage that recognised the location as the same used in the opening credits of the television show, ""the Magician"" starring Bill Bixby from the Incredible Hulk. despite being the youngest amongst us, and the crowd I was with included former child stars and porn stars.  I thought the former child star amongst us might have known.Even funnier, I had walked into the magic show right as it was ending only to realise it was the same magician I had accidentally upstaged in Vegas, and he remembered Me, lol...ooops.Really I would want to give 5 stars but the only thing that prevented Me from doing so is that the division of the rooms from the commercial remodeling had made most areas uncomfortable and awkward.",4 star rating
1856,4/13/2016,"The magic castle is really a great experience. Just got invited the second time around and it seems even better than I remember! You can't just show up here without proof that you're a member or invited by one. Dress code, for men at least, is pretty strict. The castle itself is a huge place to explore around having several bars and showrooms. If you aren't a member yourself, you're mandated to make dinner reservations. This sucks because you're looking at $50+ per person for dinner and it ain't even that great. The magic is truly the best part of the experience.",4 star rating

1860,6/18/2012,"I had my birthday celebration there this past weekend and it was my worst visit there thus far. I've been to the Magic Castle maybe a handful of times before, and although I do think each visit is pretty much a hit or miss depending on the magic acts there, even when the show is disappointing, I'm able to still enjoy myself because I just love the ambience of the castle and the whole ""secret society"" vibe of it all. However, planning a birthday dinner for a group of 18 was a little difficult since it is an exclusive venue, and although I thought it'd all be worth it in the end, it definitely wasn't. First off, getting reservations was a little tough even though I made them a month early. Also, the receptionists all told me different things...the first time I called, the receptionist told me that I could take in as many people as I wanted without paying cover, but then later on, I found out that even with dinner, everyone still had to pay the $25 for entrance. I was also told different things about how many people I could bring in, but found out ultimately that 18 was the cut-off to eat at the regular restaurant, whereas if you have 19+ people, you would have to sign a group contract and stick with a prix-fixe menu for your party. Anyways, getting on with my review...my whole party was required to have dinner in order to get tickets to the Palace of Mystery show, and dinner was NOT good. I ordered the vegetarian dish which the waiter told me was a veggie burger, so I just thought it'd be a veggie patty, but instead, it was a burger with just lettuce, tomatoes, and a huge portobello mushroom in it! I only had 2 bites and could not finish it. Service was also horrible...with our party of 18, they split us into two tables, and I would've appreciated a notice in advance that they were going to split us up, because I was expecting us to be able to be seated together. The waiter also did not come around the table to take our orders, which I thought was really weird...instead, he stayed put at the head of the table, and pretty much had to raise his voice almost to a yell in order to ask us what we each wanted to order. Finally, to cap it all off, there was a $2 cake cutting fee per slice and I know they had cake left over since we brought a larger cake, but they didn't box it up and give me the left-overs. Unfortunately that night, the show didn't save the awful dinner either...I think the magic castle really needs to raise their standards for magicians because there is nothing (and I repeat, NOTHING) magical about an old married juggling act. It was funny because I saw this act before, about a year and a half ago, and was explaining to my friends how much I hoped that there would be real magic tonight instead...and unluckily for me, I had to watch their whole act again (which they have not changed or updated by the way...also with the wife making a couple of mistakes and dropping some of her juggling items.) I'm not sure if I'd come back for awhile...the past couple of times I've been, the shows have not impressed me and it hasn't been worth the drive from Orange County. Even though I researched the acts ahead of time on their website (they post a schedule of magicians for the month), it does change without advanced notice, which is what happened to us when one of the real magic acts was replaced with those freakin jugglers again! If you do come, don't come with a large party as it is hard to accommodate, and I think you'd have a better experience coming during the week, because it is really busy on Fridays and Saturdays.",2 star rating

1863,9/16/2009,"I'll admit to being prejudiced because I celebrated my 21st birthday here with friends --- more time has passed since then than I'd like to remember. That was a weird night because all my friends had crises at the last minute and cancelled out, resulting in a table full of strangers filling in at the last moment --- but what a great way to get to know each other, i.e., where there's so much other stuff going on that you don't have to work too hard to get conversation going and people are usually pretty excited to be there. Inside secrets ... what you need to know to optimize the evening: I suggest, if it fits your schedule, that you go for the first dinner seating which I believe is 6:30 p.m. That way, you're just finishing dinner as the show in the main room is going to start. Your waiter will give you a ticket for guaranteed seating for the main show. I also suggest you sit towards the left side of the main room (as you face the stage) so that you can quickly exit through the door which delivers you around the bend to where usually the next show will take place (Parlor of Prestidigitation), because it's smaller and can't accommodate the entire crowd if the main room is full when the show finishes. When you leave the Parlour of Prestidigitation, there will be a bar in front of you and to the right at the end of the bar is a table where a close-up magician is usually working. If you put a 10- or 20-dollar bill down on the table as a tip, you'll usually have a blast as the magician plays to you and your guest(s). The food ... Years ago the quality was horrible. That has, thankfully, changed for the better and I've sat next to wine aficionados having dinner there and heard them praise some of the selections. Some people eat there just because they enjoy the chili which is supposed to be a house favorite ... and it's pretty good. I've ordered the side of mac 'n cheese at dinner and found it yummy. The food isn't cheap, which on top of the entrance fee for the evening, makes the fun a little pricey, but I think most people would agree it's worth it ... and as an historical site, you're supporting a good thing we need to keep alive in Los Angeles --- excuse me, in Hollywood :) If it's a place you would like to visit regularly, you might want to consider their ""Associate"" (non-magician) membership. I took a ""Sorcerer's Apprentice"" (beginner's) magic class here one time a couple years ago and had more fun than I ever believed was possible!!! The problem with doing that is that after mentioning that experience when I was having dinner with a large group of people at The Palm in downtown LA, the senior executive at the table insisted I stand up and prove it. And so I did. Problem was that what I had been taught was mostly close-up magic and the poor people at the other end of the table --- so far away it appeared to be earth horizon --- couldn't see. Anyway, my only foray into magic performance :) I'll admit, there are nights when the magic shows are better than others. You might want to visit their website to see who on the list of magic stars are performing and time your visit for that, but frankly I and friends have still had a good time when the top names weren't on stage.",4 star rating
1864,3/18/2013,"My fiance and I were super excited to check this place out. We heard so much about it but it wasnt until we met a magician at a show in San Fran who was able to give us some passes. Once we arrived at the castle, I realized that my fiance didnt have a tie on. He had a suit but no tie therefore they wouldnt let him in unless he borrowed on from their lost and found tie bin. It made for a good laugh considering he had pirates on his tie. There is a $25 cover per person which i wasnt ready for. So it was $50 to get in for us two, plus the $8 valet. Already making for a pricey night but whatever we are on vacation. The inside of the castle is pretty big! There are rooms below ground, upstairs, and about 4 bars inside. You can find magicians sitting at the bars or wandering around so you can ask them questions or in our case, one actually performed a little trick while we waited for our show to begin. Note, the show times are listed on your brochure but you have to get in line 30 minutes before they start or else the rooms get full. If you miss it, dont worry , you can wander to some of the random rooms where they have card tricks going on etc. We got there around 7:45 and our dinner reservations were for 9:45. We had about 20 minutes of waiting around, other than that we were kept busy by wandering. Dinner time- I totally thought the food was going to be cheesy, typical, banquet hall type food but actually it was REALLY GOOD! I had the roast chicken and my fiance had the filet. The bread that comes standard with the meal was AMAZING! My chicken was moist, flavorful and the creamy lentils were super good. His filet was also well cooked and he wiped his plate clean. We finished with the lava cake and it was also really good..my only suggestion is to serve the ice cream on the side, by the time you got the cake, it was all melted. The main show was at 11:15, the magicians were awesome..overall this is a cool place to check out if you get some passes. Would we go again? Probably not just us two (as it was pricey) but if we wanted to take some out of town guests then why not!",4 star rating
1865,1/25/2008,"This is such a uniquely L.A. place.  I enjoy it every time I come here.  As has been said many times, the food at the Magic Castle is not the greatest.  It's definitely overpriced for what you get.  On the weekends it can take a while to get served in the dining room.  Here's a tip:  head to the downstairs bar, the one right near the entrance to the large theatre, and ask if you can order food there.  We did this once and our food arrived in like five minutes.  We were with a member, so that may have helped our case.  It sure doesn't hurt to try, though.  The drinks are also on the pricy side, but the bartender at the main bar on the entrance level knows how to make them potent enough to be worth the price tag.I do find the magic acts here terribly entertaining.  If it's your first time at the castle, see the show in the big theatre just for the theatricality of  it.  However, I think the best magic is done in the smaller theatres and the sleight of hand acts done at the bars are the very best of all.  You can get up close and personal with the magician and they'll involve you in their act, allowing you to touch their props and shuffle through their cards.  Head down to the level where the members-only bookstore is located and there's often a great sleight of hand act at the small bar there.  You'll definitely want to get in line really early for any of the theatre acts to make sure that you get a seat.  30 minutes in advance is a good idea.  Know that if you get a seat in the front couple of rows, there's a good chance you'll be asked to participate in a trick or two.  Shy folks might want to head to the back of the room.",4 star rating

I felt like it added to the mystery of the castle because it was such a labyrinth. We went during the week Magic Castle was featuring magicians from Spain, and the shows were all very intriguing and exciting!  The food was so delicious - the portobello fries were nothing like I have ever had before. The only thing I would complain about is that it was extremely crowded. The dining table next to us was less than 6 inches away, so they really pack people in to make their money.  Don't be surprised if you are rubbing elbows throughout the night!It's a great place to splurge and have a memorable night!  Just be sure you know someone to get in..",4 star rating

1870,6/13/2011,"I was very lucky to be invited to the Magic Castle by a very kind magician that I know via. my best friend. Upon first entering I was impressed with the decor, ambiance, and professionalism of the whole place. There really are no words to describe this venue - you just have to go see it for yourself. There are bars everywhere, situated in interesting places with interesting decor. Our magician friend told us the frunishings come from various places; movie sets, old hotels, and anywhere. It adds to the feel of the whole castle. The magic was unlike anything I have ever seen. Every magician has his/her own style and it was interesting watching them perform. You have to really admire the acting skill and personalities of these people, as they work so hard on their acts. It really shows. I was so impressed with Arian Black. She made doves appear out of nowhere and did awesome card tricks with a unique, graceful style. I wouldn't say there was a downside that was related to the Magic Castle. Although, to be honest, on a Saturday it can get really really crowded. And lines for the shows can be quite long. What experience I did have that took away from the atmosphere created by the magicians and staff, came from the audience. Some people here get really really drunk. I'm not sure if it was the crowd we were with that night, but my group was cut in line for a private show by a large group of very very smashed 45 yr old adults. They certaintly didn't act their age when they started being rude to my group; calling us names, jeering, and being extremely loud about it. We got into the private show with them and the I saw the worst behavior I have ever seen from an adult audience in my whole life. As we were waiting for the magician, their group became impatient and starting shouting at the magician to come out. When someone came out to talk and chat with the crowd for a bit, someone from their group kept cutting him off loudly - screaming ""MAGIC NOW"" and ""Poof"" or ""Abracadabra"".  The man who came out to chat with us commented on my dress, saying it was nice. A lady from the other group said ""whore!"".  It was just shocking and really rude they would treat Magic Castle Staff that way, yet alone another audience member half their age. The lady finally got impatient and screamed ""I want magic now!"" and the man walked back behind the curtains.He popped out again. Surprise! The very man they had been rude to was our magician for the night. He gave us a great show, allowing me to touch and hold things and participate in the magic. I began to forget about the rude group we were with and slipped into that feeling of wonder and fascination. Thankfully we did not have to put up with that same group for the rest of the night. During all the shows I revisited that feeling we all felt during childhood - a feeling of wonder, bewilderment, amazement, and magical fascination. It felt good to feel these emotions again and slip back into the comfort of knowing that sometimes we need not know the reason or mechanics behind everything.  Sometimes we need to just surrender ourselves to feeling that there is something greater than the confines of our control.

1871,6/17/2011,"A truly magical place. The exclusivity makes it all the more exciting. Prices are definitely steep ($25 cover for guests of members, one entree minimum for dinner, which is at least another $25), but the atmosphere and shows make up for it.The food was okay -- nothing special. Service was fantastic in the dining area. I got the rotisserie chicken with risotto and spinach and was satisfied, but not particularly impressed. Afterwards we wandered around the castle to try to get a feel for the layout. The castle is a lot smaller than it looks, but the decor is amazing. There's a self-playing piano named Irma that takes requests if you talk to her! Best part was the bars around every corner -- expect to leave with a significantly lighter head and wallet at the end of the night.The magic was great! If you want to catch one of the close-ups, be sure to get there at least 20-30 minutes ahead of time, because the room is tiny and fills up fast. I was a little disappointed that I was able to see through some of the tricks in the close-ups and the palace of mystery show we saw. However, I loved Pop Haydn in the parlour -- he had great showmanship and kept the crowd laughing the entire time. And the palace of mystery show had a good variation of magicians, which was a nice break from all the card tricks we'd seen.The crowd is incredibly classy (but also very drunk towards the end of the night), so make sure you dress up. Keep an eye out for magicians walking around. Some of them will perform spontaneous tricks for you if you ask nicely enough :)",5 star rating
1872,6/20/2011,"The magic shows are very spectacular and comical, which makes it that much more entertaining! If you get yourself involved in the acts/shows, you will enjoy it even more.If you did not eat dinner, plan to stand in line early for the bigger show (Palace Magic). The seats get filled up quick by guests who have had dinner (because they get t o sit first). Or, if you don't want to wait, go the the last showing. But this one is definitely worth it.The dress code is very strict. Guys must have tie and jacket; they won't let you in without a jacket. Girls must be in evening wear; and if you girls plan on wearing a jacket, don't wear one with a zipper, it's considered casual. Must valet ($8).There are plenty of bars around. There is even a coctail waitress going around the stage before a show starts to make sure you keep your buzz on. The bar food is good. I recommend the Magic Burger, the Calamari, the Breadsticks, or just a side of Onion Rings. The bar food is about $8-$20, so it is totally affordable. Drinks are like any place/clubs. I recommend the bar next to Invisible Irma. You can request her to play any songs on the piano. We had a fun time trying to stump her; admittably, she was very good.",4 star rating
1873,3/31/2015,"Came here on Friday night.  Dress code strictly enforced.  You have to know a member in order to get into the magic castle. We were here to see special guest Michael carbonero from trutv. He was really entertaining and fun to watch. There are magicians from all over the world that comes here to perform. Eating dinner here will get you ticket into the main show, but you would have to reserve and if it is full then you can have dinner if someone cancels. Dinner here is little expensive,  i would say between 30-40 a plate.  The sea bass was pretty good and the steak came out as requested,  medium well - juicy and not overcooked. Soup of the day was clam chowder, i thought it was really good.  The key to the main show is to have dinner reservation and each person will receive a ticket.  We were able to fit in 3 other close up magic shows that were really fun to watch. Depending on the night and how crowded the place gets will determine how many shows u'll be able to fit in.  There are also couple bars inside, you can lounge around in between shows and there are magicians that will hang around and you'll see there's a lot aspiring magicians as well. You will also have to valet your car and the gentlemen outside are all very polite. Great time!",5 star rating
1874,2/18/2007,"Totally cool place to go if you wanna do something different.  You feel like you went back in time here!  The magic shows vary by performer.  One that I saw was amazing, while another on the same night was just OK and kinda boring.  You have to be a member or know a member to go.  Just that part makes it cool!  And you MUST dress up...that means coat and tie for boys and cocktail dresses for girls.  It's nice to go somewhere you get to dress up once in a while!  The food - I thought the food was not as bad as others had said.  I went there expecting really mediocre food but it sure surpassed my expectations!  We ordered the oysters for appetizer.  Good sized and fresh!  Then my bf ordered the prime rib and I had the rack of lamb.  Both were delicious, but I think the lamb was a little better.  The jalepeno jelly it came with gave it a god kick.  Don't miss this place if you ever get the chance to visit (invite by a member).  fun fun fun!",5 star rating

1877,11/10/2010,"Bahahahaha. I've always thought what it would like be like to go to the Magic Castle. One of my favorite dudes, Neil Patrick Harris aka Barney Stinson is on the board here! Anyway, my gf's dad knew one of the magicians and got us on the guest list for a Saturday night.Even though dinner is really pricey ~$30-50 .. the grandeur of the castle itself and the atmosphere really make it a unique night unmatched anywhere else. Everyone is in their best suits and nicest dresses and magic is being performed casually everywhere you go. On a side note, we saw Shia LeBouf, which was nifty being in Hollywood and all.What I really want to talk about though is the magic. Dinner reservations give you a ticket to the main show of the night. For those w/o dinner reservations, there's a standby line. This particular room has the largest stage in the building so it allows for bigger props and illusions. On this particular night I wasn't very impressed with the main show as one of the 3 performers played the role of a reject magician who really didn't show any magic.. well he was sort of funny I guess.For the other performances, it's merely a wait in a queue line and wait your turn to get in. Wait 20-30 minutes before a show to guarantee admission. My favorite highlight of the magic castle are the casual magician shows. You see, it's a magician's club so other magicians also come out to watch and perform! You'll see someone giving a show in a cocktail table or in the lobby or at the bar. Downstairs there's a small gallery where magicians rotate and give shows throughout the night every 10-15 minutes or so. I saw a lot of card tricks that night. I also got to see a magician who had mind reading powers! He'd ask you a question about your past and write the answer down on a tablet with correct spelling and all!Magicians rotate in and out and one night at the castle will probably be different from another night. But I have a feeling card tricks are a staple of magicians and will be there to stay any night you're there. We did see some repeat magic tricks but it was still fun to see. The magic castle stays open until 1am! So live it up!",5 star rating
1878,2/26/2007,"Wow! Bam! Alakazaam! It really was a magical night and I came on a slow night (there was still a good crowd). You start out your first magic with ""Open sesame"" which opens the door to the magical mansion. I love magic, and going to a place where everyone is just so excited to be there is fun. THe magicians were really funny and the shows personal (they really want you to tallk to each other at times). The shows are a hit and miss, there are some done by professionals and you will be fooled, but there are others where you can see the tricks. If you go to the dungeon, you can practice some magic tricks. The food is mediocre but enjoyable, don't think you're here for the food. Cocktails were strong. People show up dressed up (cocktail dresses for girls). It does get pretty pricey: the $20 cover, the food $50+, the cocktails, be sure money is is not an issue for the night. Go there with a big party or with some of your fun friends who won't say ""i think i know how it's done... it's so obvious"" to every single magic trick. it's just an awesome new activity to do.  If you decide to go there, say hi to Irma. Now if only magic is real...... !!",4 star rating
1879,9/25/2007,"I'm a scientist, but when it comes to magic, all sense of commonsense escapes me. I am the perfect spectator, because without a plausible explanation as to ""how"" the magic happens, I'm perfectly happy to agree that the phenomenon at hand is, in fact, ""magic"". ""I don't know why quarters spill from my hands""....WHAT?! How did he pick out all the aces from that deck?"" I've noticed that the magicians like to exude a false sense of ease.They'll tell you, ""Would you like to see how this trick is done?""""Why yes mister magician! I want to know all the secrets of the trade!""They will tell you nothing!Another magic trick that will get you is their sorry excuse of food. I had the chef's vegetarian special (vegetarian lasagna $16) and was disgusted. I am not a picky eater. Ok ok...I lie....I'm a little bit picky but the prices could not fool me into believing the food was good. I also tried the chicken marsala and that was good, but not spectacular. The drinks help a lot. I think it cost me 9.25 for my midori sour and $12 for a sapphire tonic. These prices are not ridiculous for drinks, and like many have stated here, they really try to push the alcohol consumption.Go for the magic and the ambiance.So....be gullible.

1881,10/28/2008,"This place is super-fun! My boyfriend got an invite from a coworker, so we were able to go without eating dinner (which I've heard mixed things about). I honestly can't wait to go back - I've got to find a way to get another invite!It may be a bit cheesy (as one reviewer said), but after the first ten minutes you're hooked. We saw three shows - a card show, a mentalist, and a balloon animal guy. All were breathtakingly awesome, and I'd see them again in a heartbeat. We went on an off-night, which I loved. It wasn't super packed and the crowd was mostly comprised of regulars who were very nice to us first-timers. I scored a cocktail napkin rose from an older guy at the bar who wanted to practice his routine, and a mini-pearl poodle from a lady waiting in line for her car. Not to mention our killer hippo balloon animal, which has impressed everyone we've shown it to. (Weriously, the balloon animal show is amazing. That guy did things with balloons that aren't physically possible!)The space is really amazing, and hard to explain in words. Labyrinthine corridors and hidden spaces are the norm, and the decor is like a much cooler version of the Haunted Mansion at Disney. The whole building is imbued with a lot of history, and if you take some time to read some of the plaques on the wall you'll gain a good understanding of the history of magic in Los Angeles.  The service is great - we ordered our first drinks at the bar and our later drinks from the super efficient cocktail waitress at one of the theatres upstairs. Prices seemed reasonable for what you're getting - any place that requires a cocktail dress and a suit jacket isn't going to have cheap drinks, but it wasn't exorbitant either. Valet parking wasn't too bad either - I think about $6 plus tip.",5 star rating

But it as a great experience! This time around we were invited by Fr. Jim Blantz who was one of the performers.  We had dinner before we arrived so all we had to pay for was parking and drinks.  And we still had just as good of a time!  The big downside is that the traffic to get into the castle sucks a$$ and the driveway to the castle entrance is a pretty steep incline so be careful about cars rolling backwards.

1896,5/27/2009,"I surprised my boyfriend on his birthday with a visit to the Magic Castle.  What better way to celebrate a b-day than with a night filled with magic, alcohol, and illuuuuusion.I give it 5 stars because we both had a blast even though there was the following:1. We had to dress up.  I'm kind of a casual sort of gal but, alas, I had adhere to a dress code and wear a cocktail dress.  But if you're super creative you could get away with something fun like bedazzled fedoras, leather pants, and piano key ties.  The possibilities are endless.2. Waiting an hour for the close up magic.   It was like waiting for a roller coaster ride or a really crappy band.  For the other shows, we had to wait about 30 minutes for great seats.  We didn't mind because we were enjoying each others company, we had drinks, and because we would randomly get into conversations with other people.  It was a waiting adventure!  Sidenote: if you plan on going, small groups are best.  There are only 22 seats for the close up magic and about 58 for the magic in the parlor.  Second sidenote: if you want to be pulled into the magic act (or trick your friend into being pulled in), sit in the front row or in an aisle seat.2. The food was expensive.  It's expected.  We went all out with the beef wellington and the filet mignon with dungeness crab.  It was the best thing they yanked out of a cow.  We experienced multiple food-gasms.  I kid you not.  If you're on a budget, just live on the alcohol and don't bother with the dinner.  Or, if you do require solid sustenance, buy about 15 bucks worth of appetizers and desserts.  I only say this because each person is required to spend at least 15 on dinner.  The great thing about dinner is that you get reserved seats to the main show, therefore saving you extra waiting time.Some other tips:1. We had 9:30 dinner reservations.  This was the perfect time.  Since the place opens around 5, it gives you plenty of time to see 2-3 shows before dinner.  Then after dinner, you can catch the main show at 11:15, and then any other show at around 12.2. Take advantage of the magic at the bars.  If the lines seem way too long to wait or if you missed a show, there's magic going on nonstop at the bars.3. Look out for the Castle Knights.  They're guides who'll show you around the castle and tell you which shows you should catch.",5 star rating

I let him do it... just in case, it was a prank. :)You open into a bar and most people are dressed up. Dresses for girls and suits for guys. I like the dress code. It makes it seem much nicer... since I don't have to look at everyone's Ed Hardy jeans for an evening. The crowd is mostly older and that was kind of nice. I didn't want to deal with young hoolingans behaving badly. Anyway... it was really old-fashioned looking on the inside and is a place I will never forget.The meal, which you must purchase, was pricey! But, at least it was rather tasty...and we did have salad and beef wellingtons. But I'm not used to spending nearly $130 for two people.

1901,1/15/2011,"Attended Magic Castle with a meetup group, a party of 7, on a rainy Sunday evening in late December. There was a $20 cover charge per person. Valet parking as well, so $8 plus tip.The decor was festive, as it was a week before Christmas. The Magic Castle has a Victorian decor, which gives it a vintage charm. There is an upscale dress code, which I had heard was strictly enforced prior to attending. Though when you look at some of the outfits the ladies were wearing, they ranged from cocktail dresses to formal. Perhaps they're more lenient on women?We had dinner as well. One of the odd things is that they have a $10 splitting charge (to discourage sharing), as well as a $15 minimum charge for food per person. I ordered the shrimp penne pasta, and the red velvet cake for dessert. My friend had a slow roasted... meat dish...? (Sorry, blanking out here.) Overall, the presentation and quality of the food was decent, though overpriced. Some of our party found their portions smaller than they would have liked.The acts themselves are much like going to any live act show. Some acts are a hit, and others are a miss.The main show had three acts: the opening act was the host performing simple tricks in a comical and entertaining fashion, the second act was a ventriloquist (which I felt was out of place and boring), and the final act was a magician that incorporated birds into his act.We managed to catch one other, a parlor show. The magician was hilarious. My friend was even selected to participate, which makes it all the more worthwhile.Let yourself be dazzled by the tricks (and environment), don't overthink everything, and you'll find yourself fairly entertained. Go in a group or a date, as there'll be a lot of down time waiting in line. Get there early, and manage your time to get the most for your money and see more shows. It is more pricey overall than I would have liked, so I'd only come back if it were a special occasion. Perhaps skip dinner here if you want to save a bit.

I don't know, but it was just excellent service!  HOWEVER, the food was just ok :(  We couldn't finish our prime rib or steak and lobster dinner.  Their house special chili wasn't all that special either.  The food was pretty expensive for the quality and taste.  I think it was around 135 for the both of us.The shows were amazing!  I loved the close-up gallery.  How in the world did he switch the cards right in front of my eyes?!!!  I still can't figure it out!  The close-up galleries were my favorites.  I also liked Toto.  He was great!  Overall, this was quite an experience.  You have to experience this at least once in your life.  I wouldn't come back to this place once a year or anything, but I won't mind coming back here in 5 years or so.  It was a nice experience and I might come back in a few years on the weekend, as I would think they'll have better shows on the weekend.",4 star rating

1906,5/18/2008,"We visited the Magic Castle with six friends on May 16th, we had a pass from a member, (if you don't know a member guests of the Magic Castle Hotel  have acess to Magic Castle)     At first I was hesitant to travel to Hollywood from the Bay Are for dinner at a Magicians club.   Sounded kind of strange but did a bit of research and saw that the Magic Castle is an 'institution' with rave reviews.  Let me add I am not a huge fan of magicians but it sounded too good to pass up.The cover charge is $25 for each person in your party,  plus cost of dinner/drinks.  Considering what it costs to go to a concert or play, this was really a great deal.    You basically get a full evening of entertainment and dinner for far less than $100 per person.  The  magic shows we saw before and after dinner were excellent (except for the drunk audience member who kept interrupting the show to let us all know it was her birthday).     Aside from that,  the mansion is a lot of fun,  kind of feels like a cross between Harry Potter, the Adams family and a restaurant.   The crowd was approximately 35-55 on average.   If  you go, stay at Magic Castle Hotel  which is beside the Castle.  It is a cozy hotel with suites for $199 (with AAA), a pool, free breakfast, secure parking for $10  and within  walking distance of the Chinese theater and other Kitchsy attractions of Hollywood.",4 star rating

1908,2/8/2011,"I love magic. I love romance. These two reasons may make me biased, but get over it. This place is pretty rockin.Any excuse to get dressed up and wear 6 inch heels is a good excuse. :) My date, luckily, is also a fan of getting dressed up to go out, so the dress code wasn't a big deal for either of us. This place is BUSY. And I don't mean The Edison busy, I mean like Disneyland on a holiday busy. Luckily it is mostly older people and they tend to sit down when they are wasted, so I didn't get a bunch of alcohol spilled on me, but it was definitely crowded in there. However, I did call the reservation desk the morning of our reservations, 9:45pm, and they suggested that we arrive either at 5pm or just before so we would have ample time to watch shows. I am SO glad that we did! We saw all the shows we wanted before dinner.Like I said, I love magic and romance. Arthurian Lore is one of my favorite areas of study, but I digress. In a world that is so literal and cynical, it is relaxing and, for lack of a better description, nice to let go and be fooled by card tricks. Don't go expecting to see Houdini type tricks, but go for the comedy and the sincerity of the magicians. They love what they do, and their passion is catching. You should leave with a smile on your face.The drinks are strong. If you are like me and are a one hit wonder, beware. I know I saw the Hat and Hare bartended put coke in my JD, but the drink was pretty clear and I had a nice Asian glow goin on. :)The food...meh. Our waiter was inattentive and the dressing on my salad was funky. I ordered dessert and it never came. That was annoying. You would think that  since this club is so exclusive and expensive they could hire decent waiters. ESPECIALLY since they get tipped well. The one thing I thought was horrid about The Magic Castle:After the last show we were all walking out and my date had given me his jacket. (It gets pretty cold in there, fyi. If you are like me and never wear dresses that leave a good 70% of your body exposed, bring a jacket.) And this power tripping waiter walks by my date and tells him to put his jacket back on. Um, hello, freezing girl here. Honestly, he made me give my date back his jacket and put it on. WHAT AN ASSHOLE. Luckily that happened as we were leaving, otherwise it may have pissed me off the entire night. My date, though, is such a gentleman and politely did what he was asked, and as soon as he was able, gave me the jacket back. Overall, I'd go but don't expect great food or service. Go for the magic and the romantic atmosphere.",5 star rating
1909,3/2/2011,"One of my most FAVORITE experiences in LA since I've moved here. I bought the open sesame membership as a gift... the cost stung for a little but after months of sitting on the membership without a single visit, I've forgotten how much it hurt my wallet. Open Sesame allows for you to bring one guest without charge... I had the AWESOME benefit of being that guest :)From the moment we walked in, it was obvious that the experience was going to be unique. The staff was incredibly friendly and informative as it was our first time; believe me... I am most DEFINITELY the type to ask questions. The decor and layout of the castle made me feel as if I was in a scene from the early 1900s... I felt as if I were part of an exclusive flappers club with everyone in character from the finely dressed patrons to the exceptional staff. In the dim lighting, we sat in the main dining room to eat brunch. While children are allowed for daytime dining, it wasn't at all a bother as the kids were well mannered. (THIS IS NOT DISNEYLAND!) Chatter in the room was the right volume and (for the most part) in good taste... we unfortunately sat next to a snotty group of 6 who were interested in nothing but 1] being completely intoxicated at 11 am and 2] talking about their goals of stardom as a celebrity. Food was EXTREMELY pricey for what we got. $40 each for a brunch buffet. The selection was decent but we ended up maxing out on FRUIT (the safest option) after tasting the super greasy eggs and chalky waffles. The waffle topping containers looked as if they haven't been changed for 2-3 days (I KNOW how this looks... I worked in an ice cream shop for a year... don't ask). Needless to say... I probably will not eat here again.BUT!!! We saw three shows, each of them very different from the other. While the magicians had to make their presentations under 21 appropriate, the jokes were cleaver, meeting the adult needs, and the tricks were fun. While I was not ""blown away"" by most of the tricks, it is impressive seeing the discipline and passion of these performers. The Magic Castle was truly entertaining and completely different from any other experience I've had. I will go back and next time, probably with a group. Not for the food (although I'm considering giving them a chance at dinner) but to mingle in a fun atmosphere unlike anywhere else. Once you've been out and about in LA, roof tops and dark lounges start to get boring and repetitive. Can't wait till next time!!!",4 star rating

We saw a few magicians perform but nothing was better than the Asian Harry Potter. That guy did some sick tricks. The great part was that at the end of the show, we hung out with him and he was a real cool guy. This place is a hit or miss with magicians. Some times you get really lucky like we did.

There is nothing like this place, and I assure you you won't leave unsatisfied.We went on a Sunday evening, which was perfect because we didn't have to wait in line for any of the shows like you would have to on Friday or Saturday nights. We ended up seeing four shows, all great, though some were better than others.We also dined at the Palace of Mysteries, and enjoyed every dish we ordered. Garlic cheese bread, portobello fries, crab cakes, beef wellington, everything is exceptional.The signature drinks there are great too, they're always VERY strong, which is unusual at some places.All in all, a remarkable evening -- highly recommend that you go this place at least once in your life -- amazing experience.",5 star rating
1915,1/18/2015,"first and foremost, yours truly is reviewing the magic castle as an experience, because that's exactly what it is!  one that not everyone has or will have the chance to partake in given the castle's exclusivity, but if you do, well, my friend, you're in for a treat!on with the show!  first things first, we got a monday reservation at 8:00pm for dinner.  the best option possible if you ask me.  this is my third time there and the previous times, we were there on a weekend and it was an early dinner... so this was perfect.  plenty of people, not over crowded, we arrived at 6:00 pm so we had time for yummy cocktails (yes, of course it was my gin and tonic two limes, thank ya!) and we were able to enjoy a few shows...  i definitely recommend mr. rich ""the hands"" freeman, cool card tricks, humor and super cool gentleman.  how cool? so cool that he invited my pals and i to return to the castle!  drink (or drinks) in hand, we moved through the maze that is the interior. the drinks are fairly priced, even for premium alcohol.dinner, now let's remember that this is not technically a steak house, buuuuuuut, i can't complain about my medium-rare new york steak, my favorite!  not the best steak i've had, but it was still pretty delicious, my cavewoman came out for a wee bit!  creamed spinach, asparagus, potatoes, everything was magical!  eh? see what i did there? service was fantastic, our waiter couldn't have been the nicest and most attentive.the sad part: we missed the main show, but ended up at another show were i got to participate! we technically had our minds read.  I know that's not possible or is it???we stumbled upon the library, took a peek at magician school, drank some more cocktails, had our picture taken by the in-house photographer (i recommend you spend the $20 as there is NO photography inside and you'll get a little gift with purchase, trust me, or my name is not vintage vee!) and lastly did a little drunk shopping at the gift shop.  still waiting to use my magic wand!now go, have a good time, dress to nines (definitely observe the dress code), come hungry and thirsty and go in with an open mind!  cheers!",5 star rating

First off, I love that you have to dress up because it's not everyday you get to wear a fancy dress/suit on a night out in LA. Boys - Wear dress shoes and not casual shoes that kind of look like dress shoes because my bf had to take his off and wear the loaner shoes they had (ew). For dinner, I had the caesar salad, prime rib, and flourless chocolate cake, and it was all just okay. I didn't hold high expectations, since obviously they're not known for their food, but it's nice that they have the whole experience of a show with dining available. The magic shows here are intimate and MIND-BLOWINGLY AMAZING! We saw one of the short half hour ones in the small theater and left in awe because I had no idea what just happened. After our meal, someone had mentioned not seeing any card tricks yet, and next thing you know, a magician comes up in front of us and starts doing a bunch of card tricks that I cannot even fathom! Finally, we were able to see the last show in the larger theater, and that was a lot of fun and still...mind-blowing. I guarantee you'll leave here just as confused and amazed as I was!",5 star rating
1918,4/29/2015,"I never thought I would ever get tickets to the magic castle, it was one of those places everyone knows about but none get in kind of places. My girl and I won some tickets at a charity raffle and have gone twice now. OMG, its beautiful outside and in, the quality of service and entertainment is top notch, and the food is delicious! We went once at night and once for brunch. The brunch buffet is better value for money and has so much amazing food, but the magic and shows tend to be very kid/family oriented. The dinner service is delicious, but is a bit more expensive and does not have large portions. Still a VERY good meal though. Also the evening shows tend to be longer, and of higher quality. Overall I'm very pleased with both experiences and am so happy that I got to go. If you get a chance you must hang out with Erma the ghost piano player, and buy a picture for extra passes.

Ponytails and glittery vests abounded.  Just terrible.  - Drinks - Overpriced. Go here once because it is a landmark and then you are done.",2 star rating

1922,9/2/2011,"I can not get enough of this place. There are pros and cons to it of course, but the old school feel to it is exhilarating. I hate that you have to order dinner here, unless accompanied by a magician. I've been 3 times, and the first two times I didn't mind, since they had the best tasting short ribs, but my last trip there I realized they took the Short Ribs off the menu. The shows can be hit or miss, one night you'll laugh your A$$ off, and the next you might yawn a bit. Overall this place is a must see for any fan of magic, or just of historical buildings. And go as a group cuz valet ain't cheap! -I tell it like it is.",4 star rating
1923,3/21/2014,"First off - don't buy into the hype of this being super exclusive - just Google free invite magic castle and you can go to a guys webpage and he will send you an email invitation. So ANYONE and I mean ANYONE can go.The building itself is awesome. Everything is beautiful. Carved wood, long winding staircases, and just am amazing vintage feel. That's were awesome ends.1.) $30 a person just to get it. Just to go around, look at shit, and that's it. Even if you eat dinner - it's still $30. Plus mandatory valet at $10. So you are already down $70 the moment you enter. 2.) Dinner. We spent $170 for a meal (not counting tip) that was just OK and one that I was rushed through. For the quality of the meal, I would have felt better about spend $50 less. And would have then given it a better rating. We got the shrimp cocktail, I had the ravioli (4 little ravioli - that's it). The dish was $28. They were just ok. I don't mind paying big money for food, but that shut better blow us away. I have had better ravioli at the Cheesecake Factory for less money. I get part of the price is ambiance, but that's what I paid for with then entry fee. I also felt very rushed - because we were. They had two seating for dinner. So they rush you through it so they have time to sit their next seating. When i am at a ""nice dinner"", i like to sit back, enjoy my company, drink some wine and relax. That isn't happening here. Dinner was from start to finish, as hour. We weren't even done with our app before they brought are main course.3.) Next piece that sucked was that you are only guaranteed access to one of their shows. The others are all 1st come 1st served and they fill up super-fast. We went to go stand in line for one that started in 30 mins and the line was already completely wrapped around itself. We didn't get in to see it. You need to get in line at least an hour before each big show. So you would sit around and do tons of waiting. Then the show we did get to see - was like 20 mins long if that. You had to get in line so early - even though this was our guaranteed show. Then you have to wait for 30 mins and sit there for the show to start. I just felt like it was set up in a way that you spent more time going back and forth from finding a show and standing in line and you get to only see one show. 4.) One cool thing is they had like 3 bars throughout the place. You really didn't have to wait to long for a drink. But damn expensive. Seriously $14 for a grey hound that had a one ounce poor. Come on now....this isn't Vegas.5.) Then they cram FAR too many people into this place at one time. I'm sorry, but i don't like moving through a sea of people that are shoulder to shoulder. I'm not clubbin'also had to drive an hour to get there. For a total of $400 spent - it was a HUGE disappointment. I wouldn't go back if someone paid for me.",2 star rating

1926,8/6/2011,"Oh man.How is it that I lived in Los Angeles for over a decade, had a friend (well, really an acquaintance) who was a magician, and never came here? No idea. You only realize once you move away what you were missing out on.So, when I found out I could gain entry by being a guest at the Magic Castle Hotel next door on my next business trip to LA, I was all over it. I went EVERY night to the shows. And it turns out it's pretty different every night. Which is pretty awesome. I love close up magic and these guys were good at it. I knew how the tricks were done, having some amateur magician in me, but still, they did it so well. Great presentation. Great stage presence. Loads of laughs. Lots of fun. Tom Ogden was hilarious, especially his impromptu remarks.Basically, the whole inside of the building is a series of bars, with a few rooms reserved for magic acts. There is a lot of drinking going on and the drinks are good. The upstairs has a large dining room. Everyone is dressed up in suits and ties for the gents, and skimpy low-cut ""dresses"" for starlets. The staff, of course is all in tuxedos. To me, it was nice not to be subjected to fat men in polo shirts, jeans and loafers without socks. I felt classy like Cary Grant for once, and there was his picture up on the way. Well, cheers! Let's toast to Cary! The food is in my opinion awesome, especially nice vegetarian selections including a great risotto and a nice ravioli in saffron sauce. Desserts are deadly: gigantic slabs of chocolate cake literally too big to fit on the plate, huge scoops of ice cream, a banana cream pie with a crust made out of peanut butter cookies and enough fresh whipped cream to give a rhino a heart attack.

I was worried we were going to be charged or something, but that didn't happen.Dinner Review:dinner rolls: SMELLS. DELICIOUS. These oh so soft warm cinnamon delicacy were as good as they smelled.House salad: We got 1000 dressing. I really enjoyed their dressing, I wish I could get the recipe for it. Portobello fries (shrooms in tempura batter): Juicy. Surprisingly really goodNY steak: Full of fat. Quality would have been ok for... denny's? maybe even black angus.

Oh you must be talking about that faint taste of diluted kraft cheese sauce from the blue box. We enjoyed most of the shows. Some shows seem to rely heavily on the comedic side but still entertaining none the less. Two ways to have more fun: 1) Get churself a drink (very generous) 2) Either you or someone from your party should participate in the magic trick if possible it makes the shows that much more entertaining.",4 star rating
1929,8/23/2013,"So, going to the Magic Castle has been on my LA bucket list for a while.  How to get that elusive invite?  One just dropped in my lap one day so to speak.The dress code is strict so guys you must wear a suit and you must wear a tie.  They are checking your shoes too.  Firstly, you must make reservations at the restaurant in order to see the main show.  They literally hand you the tickets to the main show after you pay the check.  Unfortunately the food quality is not that great.  They charge you an arm and a leg however they have not matched the food selection or quality in my opinion.  The main show was a bit cheesy and one of the acts didn't work so we accidentally saw the ""magic"".  The rest of the night you spend lots of time standing in line to get into a show.   You have to wait about 45 minutes in line if you don't get in before the next show starts.  A little annoying.  I found the close up magic to be very fun.   As you explore the castle you will see magicians set up at tables and doing their rope/card/etc...tricks.  That was cool because on two occasions I got to participate in the magic trick.  You can also talk with the magicians easily in this area.  There are tons of bars around the place so you don't really have to wait for a drink.  I would say to get there early and try getting into the smaller magic rooms before going into the main room since the main room is so big and you can probably get in easier towards the end of the evening.It was fun to do once but not sure if I would go again.  I felt like it was a lot of hoop jumping to get tickets, get in, have a mediocre dinner and deal with those huge crowds.",4 star rating
1930,4/21/2012,"Tacky, mediocre, and amateurish are the words that come to mind when I now think of the Magic Castle....I went there for the first time on April 15, 2012 for brunch. I had heard how difficult it is to get in because you need to know someone, you have to be a member, special privileges, etc, etc....Well, I guess I expected more. The ""castle"" reminded me of the haunted house in Disneyland....tacky. The place looked rundown, dilapidated, and dirty. For brunch I felt like herded cattle just to get food that was mediocre at best, and way over-priced. And the most important part - the magic - was amateurish. Some of the tricks were poorly performed.  Overall, I walked away feeling cheated and gouged. I don't recommend this experience at all. Save your money for a vacation somewhere, because for two kids and two adults we paid $230.

I ordered the Beef Wellington and it was alright.  The puff pastry was a little soggy and the tenderloin was a tad undercooked, but overall the flavors were there.  The ""grand finale"" show was in better terms, PAINFUL...  The opening act seemed like he was preforming a act to a bunch of 5 year olds. His use of balloons was pedestrian and outdated.  The customs were ridiculous and the music was ear piercing.  The second act had a similar ear bleeding music and about this time I had enough, I left halfway through the act, luckily I was in the back and could escape without interrupting the performer.  I'm glad I went, but I'll NEVER go back again.  Unless you have an guest invite, you're not missing anything.",2 star rating

1934,7/23/2013,"I did a search on Google and was able to find a magician (thanks, Mike Wong) who would issue invitations to the Magic Castle via email for up to 7 people.  You are required to have dinner there, though, with this invitation.  If you can, try and get an invitation from someone that doesn't require dinner.  Dinner was better than I thought, but way overpriced.  $27 for some rigatoni and sausage?  I had to make reservations about two months in advance to get an 8 p.m. dinner on a Saturday - so plan far in advance!.We arrived around 6, but valet took a few minutes.  The driveway going up to the Magic Castle is too short to accommodate all their customers, so you end up waiting in one long line.  Valet is also $10.  Everyone is very dressed up - I wore a regular dress, but I felt underdressed.  My friend noticed that a woman who wore dressy sandals was not allowed to enter, so she had to wait for her friend to bring her some Magic Castle-appropriate shoes.  Also, my other friend wore a regular black winter coat, but everyone else wore a suit coat.  The bouncer said he might not get in, but he did.  Phew.  Also, inside, one of the workers asked him (not very nicely, either - you'd think that not having your tie shoved up all the way under your chin was the end of the world) to button up the top button of his shirt, which he couldn't do bc it was too tight.  So the man settled for him making the tie knot very tightly pressed under his chin.  Whatever.  Everyone got a drink at the bar, the cheapest on the menu being $11.  Oh, and it costs $25 per person to enter the Castle.It kinda sucks that you only get one VIP ticket per person to one show when you dine at the Castle.  For the kind of money we paid for dinner ($58 pp, with no dessert and no appetizers...just one entree per person and a bottle of wine), I'd think they'd give at least two tickets.  There are bars everywhere, and you can drink anywhere in the Castle - genius, or what?  They give you free rolls dusted with cinnamon, which was one of my friend's favorite part of dinner - they were really good.  The steak and the prime rib were okay, and my rigatoni was pretty spicy.  No pictures allowed inside, so I don't have any pics of the food. We were able to see four shows, and you have to go early (maybe 15-30 min, depending on the show) to get in line to get in.  A lot of time was spent waiting between shows or for shows, so I recommend going w/ people whose company you enjoy!  What sucks is that if you are late, it is possible to not get into any of hte shows.  I saw that the Castle fits over 400, and I think they were filled to capacity.  We also saw Dianna Agron, who played Quinn from Glee, in line behind us!  Anyway, we were lucky and sat in the front row of two of the shows and second row in another, then last row for the last show.  The Close Up Gallery is by far the most intimate, which seats about 24.  You are right up close to some nifty card tricks.  The Palace of Mystery is the largest, seating well over 100.  I guess the Peller Theater (downstairs) is their newest venue, which pairs two different magicians in one show.  I loved all the shows, and was able to figure out part of a few tricks (like the ""pick a card"" - you think you're choosing a random card, but they place it so you pick the one they have chosen), but it was a lot of fun.  Everyone who came had a blast.  We didn't leave until after midnight.  I thought there'd be a long line for valet, but there wasn't. I'd love to go back, minus the dinner part - anyone have a hook up??  :)",4 star rating
1935,3/10/2011,"I LOOOVE this place. Now, I've had VIP access to clubs where the bouncers put the non VIPs behind a velvet rope and hand pick people who look cool enough to get in, but this place is actually TRULY cool. There's nothing about looks here. It's about who you are and who you know. It's probably the most exclusive ""club"" I've been to. You have to be invited to get in. You aren't even allowed to take pictures!I was born and raised in Los Angeles, and I remember passing by the mansion as a kid. I had no idea what went on in there until I was old enough to get in (21+).There is a strict dress code (formal or business attire), and I've heard of ways to get away without having to eat dinner, but I haven't been able to manage that. Being vegan, there really isn't anything on the menu for me to eat, but the waitstaff is usually very accommodating and provided me with a suitable (yet pretty bland) alternative. The regular menu doesn't usually get rave reviews from the people I'm with, but it's not about the food at all. You go for the magic shows.The main room usually has some kind of cheesy show, very akin to the kind you might see Gob from Arrested Development do. It's a must see (because everyone wants to see it), and if you get to dinner early enough, you'll get priority passes from your waiter.After that, try to catch some roving magicians doing magic anywhere they can find a place to sit. If you can, also check out the Parlour of Prestidigitation for some incredible slight of hand! I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot of great things about the Castle, but maybe that's a sign I'm due back for another visit!",5 star rating

1937,8/1/2007,"My friend's dad is a magician and has a membership here so he took us all in for a brunch buffet. The food would be compared to a middle of the road Reno or Vegas hotel buffet. I don't remember it being horrible, nor do I recall it being excellent, bottom line is it wasn't memorable.The magic show was pretty cool. I had my little sister with me and she enjoyed it a lot. You can walk around and see some interesting little things they have set up. I would say it was definitely a different dining experience and would take a 2-3 hours to do it all.",3 star rating
1938,8/4/2010,"I have been to the Magic Castle many times over the past 6 years and this was one of the best nights I have ever been. I went July 31 and they were show casing young magicians week and it was very entertaining. We had dinner reservations for 6pm and arranged to meet and go in at 5pm. I high recommend this, because the Hollywood Bowl is around the corner and traffic can be brutal. Also having an early dinner means you can focus on seeing as many shows as possible. We left at midnight and saw about 7 shows, including theater shows and closeup magic near the bars. They recently changed their menu and let me tell you, it is for the better. I recommend the Portobello Fries, Prime Rib, Garlic Bread and Lamb Chops. The Creme Brulee for dessert was also amazing. Bar drinks are a little pricey but reasonable. You do a lot of walking in the castle, going from show to show and up and down stairs, so next time I will leave the heels at home. It was also really hot and most of the men had taken off their sport coats and carried them around. Don't forget to tip Irma, so she'll play your favorite song!",5 star rating
1939,9/17/2010,I am always smiling when I go to the Magic Castle. Great food-Great drinks-Amazing entertainment. I will tell you though - the reason that the rating is only a four star and not a five is because I'd the front of house staff. I was visiting the Sunday before labor day and my guests and I all agreed afterwards that the only negative was the girl at the front. Very cold unfriendly and honestly just awful. I've had friendlier service at my car wash.  Then I thought back and I've never really had a friendly warm experience at the front of the magic castle. No bueno.,4 star rating

1941,1/6/2010,"Magic castle= Freakin' magical times!When my friend told me he was taking us to an exclusive ""magic castle"" where people got tipsy to watch magic, I was a little skeptical but really, this place is AWESOME.The place is an old, three-story mansion built in hollywood in the 1920s.  It has a very speakeasy-feel in the sense that you have to know someone who is a member in order to gain entrance and they also give you a password that opens up the bookshelf-doorway into the castle!  Don't come in jeans, they won't let you in.  Dress to impress.  That means suits for men (they let you borrow a jacket if you don't have one) and cocktail dresses for women.The wooden interior is very 1920s and the various rooms on the three level chateau features various magicians.  After seeing a mathematical genius who could exponentially multiply basically anything his head, my friends and I lined up to see Latimer in the close-up room, who was AMAZINGGG!  His magic was indescribable.  He was so fast and I cannot explain how he pulled half the things he did.  On a totally different level, I bet you he has a magic stick.  I kid you not every man and woman in that room wanted to hit that.  I took off a star because the bar service could be better.  My friends and I decided to grab a drink at the bar at the second level before lining up for our first show.  The bar tender was painfully slow because she took orders one at a time.  A sign of a good bar tender is someone who can efficiently and effectively serve multiple people at the bar.  Also, the bar was not stocked with the liquor of my first requested cocktail.  The cool thing is though, they always ask if the audience wants a drink before any show starts to make sure you are as boozed as you want to be.  Next time, I'm coming back earlier so I can see more than three shows and to try the restaurant!",4 star rating
1942,3/20/2014,"Holy carp!   I read some of these reviews and I asked myself were they paid to give good reviews?   The best experience I had was valet parking on the way in.  There were no magicians around the facility,  it's the magic castle where is the entertainment?  One guy at a table near the bar doesn't cut it with card tricks.  It was so crowded that you couldn't move,  the drunken members of the land of the great unwashed was staggering,  and since there was only one bar open,  that's frigging amazing.  No direction inside,  running from bar to bar looking for an open one to get anything to drink,  no luck.   Now the meal,  this is what I call Klassy!   I ordered lobster bisque,  it was cold and tasted like cascade dishwasher detergent.   Charming!   As if it couldn't get worse,  I stepped away to use the men's room,  and my meal was placed at my seat when I was gone,  really??   I get there and it's cold like it was cooked 15 to 20 minutes ago and left to cool off,  are you kidding me?   I only was having water,  but only one glass since there is no one to refill the glass.   And watching other people's faces when their steak came out bloody and undercooked even it was medium rare.  Then being stepped on by drunken debutantes and their handlers was awesome again while waiting to get into a show to actually see a magical act.   The acts,  we're decent,  I enjoyed them.  But,  for the  magic castle... That's all?  Now go sit on hard chairs sweating since the air conditioning isn't keeping up and dodging the water dropping from the ceiling and avoiding the buckets it's being caught in while not slipping on wet floors.   Nice!   It's more like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.   Now,  here's the clincher... Thank goodness,  and every one of the 4 of us in the car have the same reply... That wasn't great.   I decide to write a note to the Magic Castle letting them know how the experience went. I didn't get any response for 3 days. When I eventually did hear from the Magic Castle they were apologetic. They asked which member I came with so they could track down my reservation. They then called the member and invited me and caused World War 3. Because they won't talk to me directly because I'm not a member and they don't value my opinion because I'm not. Only members are considered important. So my opinion and the time I spent there consider irrelevant by the Magic Castle.  The member considered my reaching out to be disrespectful,  and the Magic Castle has done nothing but cinch that  I write this and consider the castle a place to must miss.   Horrible doesn't even come close to describe.",1 star rating
1943,4/2/2013,"I've been wanting to visit this place for soooo long.  I finally secured an invite and a bunch of us made a night of it.  This is a lovely victorian mansion that they have converted into a private magicians club.  The inside really makes you feel like you've taken a step back in time.  There is magic everywhere.  We were able to see two shows and a few of the smaller side shows.  I loved the magicians and the magic!  We had to do dinner here which was okay.  The food is okay but you don't really come here to eat. I had the filet which was decent. People in our group ordered the fish, prime rib, pasta...a good variety.  Everything was okay.  Nothing to rave about but it wasn't awful either.    The drinks are good but pricey.  Unless you come in with a magician plan on spending about 200 for a couple with cover, parking, dinner and drinks.Some people in the group ordered dessert later on at the bar.  The chocolate lava cake was pretty good.  Nice and hot with a scoop of ice cream. Dress code is strictly enforced!! I love how everyone is dolled up and the guys look good too in their suits, tuxes.  Definitely adds to the atmosphere.   They do not allow pictures inside but you can take as many as you want outside and inside at the check in area.  This place is definitely worth a visit, a hollywood MUST!",4 star rating

You need to have a member invite you or have a large enough group that they'll accept you, which in my case was my company's holiday party.As soon as you walk in the magic starts. You need to speak to an owl in a bookcase to gain entry inside, then there's lots of mini-rooms within the castle where magicians are performing shows.

Cocktail attire but Seriously ...one of the cheesiest places ever...BUT a good time.. It's super dated and it feels like you fell into the twilight zone with all the creepy magicians and dated furniture.. besides all that some of the acts are really good and extremely quick. The ""big show"" was super cheesy but my friend i went with said the assistant was super hot, you can't beat a cute girl running around in fishnets and thong haha. So guys theres a plus+++ The food was good at the restaurant and they had decent drinks, kinda pricey but fun server and fun atmosphere..they have 11 some bars around the castle and the shows get better when your drinking a little.

There was a good variety at the buffet, and the (included) mimosas were very much appreciated by all. The main magic show was really entertaining - this was the family-friendly daytime show but the quality of the magic was superb!

My wife had the same experience with her chicken dinner.  My brother's vegetarian dish was not good as well.  It went back.  I was sorely disappointed.  I expected much more.If you're going to have some magic fun, then this is the place.  I recommend eating elsewhere.",2 star rating
1952,8/14/2011,"I LOVE MAGIC.LOVE IT TO DEATH. My life would not be complete without some magic in my life. That's where the Magic Castle comes in.Before I even get into my review of the Magic Castle, there are two things you need to know to even get in the door.1) Formal attire, my friends. In all seriousness, you are not allowed in, unless you're dressed according to their dress code. It's serious stuff.2) You can only get in, if you are a member, or know a member, OR if you know a magician. I am lucky to have gotten in once, because we knew a member, and the other time because we knew a magician, and I'm just saying now... Go with a magician, if you can.Any who, my first visit was a family visit for my mother's birthday. We got the dinner buffet and sat in the Houdini room. Sadly, they were no longer doing the Seance show for that day, so we didn't get to see it, but someone who I can't remember (probably the member who got us in) explained everything that would happen leaving a few secrets out should we ever come back to experience it. We had the buffet (i think it was a brunch kind of meal?), and it was pretty average. Not really much to say there... We then went on to see a couple magic shows which were incredible, and I suggest trying to see as many shows as possible and explore as much as you can. Head to the gallery tables too, that's lots of fun. All of the magicians are incredible and great entertainers. If possible though, go on a tour with a magician or someone who is knowledgeable of the castle. The second time I went to the Magic Castle, my friend and I got somewhat of a personal tour, because she had a magician friend. He not only knew a lot of the history of the magic castle but knew all the tricks that made the magic castle... so magical. We went through each room at our own pace, and he would tell us the history and stories about the castle or the famous magicians. He'd also do a couple tricks that literally blew our minds. Seriously there are a couple places that I can't pass by without laughing at what happened or how dumbfounded we were at some magic trick. We even got a private little magic show from him. It was... amazing and, well, magical. Like honestly, I wish I knew what they were doing, and there is no other explanation other than pure magic. It's just really cool. Even if you don't have a magician friend, just going with someone who knows a lot about magicians or the magic castle can make it fun. There is probably some tour that happens, but I wouldn't know since we never did that. Just go with great friends, and you'll have a great time. :)",5 star rating

1954,8/20/2012,"We were invited Saturday night. Our dinner reservation was for 9:45pm. You have to call in advance to make a reservation. You must have a credit card handy to reserve dinner. Also, you are charged $15 for every person that you reserve for dinner and doesnt show.When you arrive, you must use the valet which is only $8, i recommend carrying cash when visiting the Magic Castle. It makes everything much easier on you. There is an atm located inside but im not sure how much they charge to withdraw.Since it was a saturday night, we each paid a $25 entrance fee. Attire is formal ladies and gentlemen, so suit up! Cell phones are allowed inside, but there is absolutely no photography allowed beyond the main entrance. Keep phones on silent. No one really uses their phone inside, which is a nice change from always seeing people on their phone.The inside is beautiful and you are given a schedule of times and shows that take place for the night. There are also show times on digital screens inside. The Magic Castle is full of little surprises. Its entertaining to just wander around. There are a lot of stairs and a lot of walking. I am unaware of wheelchair access as i did not see an elevator anywhere but it could be hidden. There are bars throughout the castle, we didnt really order anything from the bar.  A friend ordered a beer ($7) and a glass of wine ($12) at dinner. Dinner: The menu is very nice, a little something for everyone. I had the Shrimp Lobster Ravioli($32). It was very good and well portioned. We also ordered the Chicken Noodle Soup($6), Garlic Fries, Chicken Breast, and Houdini Cut Steak. All main entree items were between $30 and $50. Also, every person MUST order at least 1 entree.We were able to see 3 shows that night but make sure you get in line early enough. The magic is great, very modern, and entertaining! Overall: The magic castle was absolutely amazing, its a wonderful experience and we plan to visit again soon",5 star rating

Just one advice, go there for drinks and magic show, but don't dine in their restaurant.",1 star rating
1956,8/23/2011,"The food at Magic Castle for the price simply isn't very good.  My risotto was, well, roughly the consistency of the Play Doh I enjoyed as a pre-schooler and the salmon was on par with a fillet I had earlier that week for less than 2/3 the cost at Lala's.  The banana cream pie, lovingly encouraged by our waiter, had all the creamy goodness of a vat of crisco.  For what you eat, your money certainly could be better spent at any number of great restaurants in the area.However, we don't go to restaurants simply to eat and Magic Castle has something wholly unique that makes it a must visit on any Angelino's bucket list.Part museum of showmanship, part spectacle, and part institution of an art that never quite made the A-list, if you don't smile, if you don't laugh, if you don't forget about the overpriced fare and enjoy yourself - then just give up now, you're not capable of experiencing fun.",4 star rating

1961,5/11/2012,"Regardless of the ridiculous amount of money I spent while I was here, I loved it. Strictly speaking, this is one of those unique events in LA that you need to at least experience once while you are in the area. It's a freaking club for magic nerds, folks. How much more awesome can this be?!You'd probably get more perks if you actually are friends with a member, but my friend contacted a member through the helpful reviews on yelp and was able to get us access with a $25 cover free. Dinner reservations were at 9:45, and the food was not worth its price but our server GUSTAVO was just so incredibly friendly. When we ran a little late into the dinner, he tried to make sure that the final big magic show wouldn't start without us. Final tips for the event:1. Doors for the venue open around 5:30. Even if your reservation is for a late dinner, come early to watch the parlor shows that are ongoing throughout the castle. Most of them will be sleight of hand tricks but each magician has his/her own individual personality to make the performance entertaining. I believe the magicians are never the same every week, and sometimes people come in from other countries to perform. I was able to watch the Japanese AMAZING Magician Toto, who was my last show of the night but wrapped it up pretty well.2. Dinner only guarantees you entry to the main magic show (the theatrical performance that includes cutting a person in half and all that jazz). You don't need to have dinner reservations to watch the parlor shows.3. Explore the castle when you can! There are a lot of really cool trinkets and even a creepy ventriloquist dummy.4. The only parking right outside the castle is valet, $8, so bring cash. There is rarely available street parking in the area, and if you are wearing heels it will not be fun to walk up the hill anyways.5. It's a formal event, so you get to dress up for magic! Dress in cocktail attire, and men must have jackets.6. Don't have high expectations for the food, especially the steak. Magic Castle doesn't specialize in culinary arts, so just order something simple and stuff yourself afterwards at McDonald's if you don't want to pay the $$.7. Hot messes get kicked out, so put on your sober face! Our dear birthday boy had a little puking accident in the bathroom, and one of the hosts was adamant about making him leave, but he was able to convince the host to let him stay. 8. Last of all, enjoy yourself! Most of you are probably skeptics who will try to figure out how the tricks are being done, but sometimes the magicians are too fast for you anyways, so just let it be and have fun!",5 star rating
1962,8/19/2010,"I feel like the Castle and I are old friends now. I've been here a handful of times thanks to my boss who has been a member since the late 60's. I always go with a different group of people because each time it becomes a different experience, not to mention you're seeing all sorts of different magicians.I don't feel bad about having to spend a bit of cash on dinner and drinks, it's a fancy establishment, you get dressed up, you drink a bottle of wine, you eat a delicious meal - it's sort of a package deal.Keep in mind, you don't have to order prime rib, you can order 2 appetizers and have that count as your meal without spending $40 on JUST an entrée.Milt Larsen created the perfect place for people of all ages (21+ only) to feel like a kid again! First your eyes light up, your mind gets blown, and then you wait another 20 minutes to let it all happen again. I love it.The magicians are incredible, I've seen my fair share of interesting individuals and I actually got to go on stage during my last visit. I got to help Justin Kredible make a table float, I know, I know. AMAZING, right? It's really really was. I believe in magic, I really really do.",5 star rating
1963,5/20/2007,"Forget the food here (which is super, super mediocre). It's all about the tricks! Maybe it's the kid in me, but I love the sense of wonderment and adventure you get when entering a place like Magic Castle. To be able to experience magic tricks so up close from different magicians in all the different parlours is such a treat. Like Cat T. says, there's something really cool about going to a place that actually requires a dress code. It just adds to the whole experience.Don't let the $$$ membership prevent you from going, there are plenty of ways to score that guest pass -- I've found some on Craigslist and other folks who simply love to share the joys of magic. Great for double-dates!",4 star rating
1964,1/14/2011,"You have to be invited by a magician but my son-in-law was able to secure an invitation on facebook. This is generally an adult only evening kind of place but on Sunday they serve a brunch (10-3) and kids are invited to attend.What a fun place! Magicians in every room were entertaining the crowd and there are several small theaters where short programs are going on. There are all kinds of secret doors, a magic phone booth, and an invisible pianist who takes requests were my favorites.The brunch was great, too. It included: shrimp coctail, salmon, waffles with fixings, fresh fruit, bacon, sausage, burittos, omlettes made-to-order, salads and gourmet desserts, etc.",5 star rating
1965,1/18/2014,"Hated hated hated this place! I went to the Magic Castle for my friend's birthday. I was very disappointed. We ate dinner here. The food was super expensive and gross. My friends got the steak. We were paying Mastros prices for sizzler quality food.The security at this place is a total joke. They have a no photography rule and I totally understand but when I used the flashlight on my phone to look at a dimly lit picture, I was scolded like a child by one of their security people. I apologized for using the light, was happy to show the pictures and videos on my phone. This guy continued to chew me out in front of my friends and fiancée. This guy looked like he hated his life and just wanted to ruin the time of a guy that looked better than him and had a good looking girl. I make a lot of money and would never waste my money on this place again. Will make sure everyone I know never goes to this place either. My goal in life is to warn people about this place.",1 star rating

Food, middling, overpriced, and forgettable.But magic good!  I swear!We had the crappiest luck the night we visited - some sort of dicklick corporation, was having their annual corporate party there.  The place was crammed to the gills with a lot of fatheaded business types and their wives and their caked-on makeup - everyone a little too rowdy for their own good, trying to say clever things during the magic acts and by clever, I mean, incredibly boneheaded and stupid.  They kind of tainted my last memory of this place. So good luck to you, my card trick loving friend.  You could go on a night with sensible humans wanting to truly be entertained, or you could get stiffed like we did and get to visit this wonderful LA landmark with a bunch of giant shaved monkeys.",3 star rating

I gotta say this place is a good as they get.It is great for dates, especially doubles and the restaurant is incredible!  I don't know what is up with some of these reviews that say the restaurant sucks, because it surely doesn't.  It is kind of pricey, but the whole place has the fine dinning atmosphere, so what else would you expect.  It's not Ruth's Chris' Steak House, but it is up there with the likes of Flemming's, and Roy's.  When I go I get the Fillet Mignon with Dungeness Crab and it's to die for.  Definitely, that and they Baily's & Coffee are two things I look forward too when I visit.",5 star rating
1968,6/13/2009,"Forgot I ever came here.Went here once with a group of people...apparently it's so exclusive you have to either be a member or be invited by a member to get into the magic castle.This place was definitely one of a kind.  You get to be entertained all night and have some food and drinks.  I think there are a couple of different ways you can do the damn thang.  Dinner is served at two different times, but you don't have to eat here, you can just get effed up all night if you want.  So we came here when it opened I think around 6 ish and I felt like such an adult with valet and a nice dinner (mind you I was 20 at the time).We watched a couple of magic shows, some great and some not so great.  I determined that the more I drank the better the magic tricks got...surprise surprise.  So we hopped around to a couple of different rooms to watch a couple of different magicians.  The place is big but I thought it would be bigger.Can't really remember much about dinner except that it was a little pricey.  I think two dinners, a salad, and two drinks came out to about $100 plus tip, but don't trust my memory because of all the different stimulants I've inhaled over the years.  But I think the food was pretty good?My favoritest (yes, I know it's not a word) part of the night was getting pulled on stage for the grand finale show.  Come to think of it, it was probably because I was wearing a short dress in the front row.  Oh well, it was a great night and everyone should go if they ever get a chance to.",4 star rating
1969,7/13/2009,"The Magic Castle seems to be one of those things everyone in LA is dying to do. After having been there twice, I guess I see the appeal. I had a decent time, but I don't think it's all that amazing.For $25 it's not too bad if you can see a lot of the different shows going on. But, depending on how busy it is, you may be stuck seeing only one or two, and having to waste time in line at that. The magic acts are hit or miss. Some are amazing, some just okay.  Erma the ghost piano player is cool, and there's some interesting things about the place. The castle itself is charming Victorian.But, the drinks are way way overpriced. The bar food is decent (hamburger is pretty good) but also overpriced.  I haven't dined at the fancy restaurant so I can't speak for that. The service is usually good, though sometimes you may have to remind them about stuff when they're slammed.  And I was mad that I missed the last showing of what was apparently an amazing act because a new bartender made it sound like we had to order our dessert right then or miss out...and they still served food long afterward. Ugh. Parking is valet, unless you can snag a street spot nearby (good luck) and want to walk up the hill.  When you get there, carefully review the schedule of shows and plan out what you want to do. If it's a Friday or especially a Saturday night, you will have to get in line early for some shows (most specifically the Close-Up Gallery).  If you don't eat at the main restaurant, you aren't guaranteed a spot for the Palace of Mystery (the big show), so get in line really early to have the best chance of getting in. Overall, it's a fun place to go at least once. My second visit was okay, but that's it. But if you have the chance to go and you've never been, definitely do it.",3 star rating
1970,8/25/2009,"I once wrestled a bear for two tickets inside Magic Castle, but unfortunately he won.  From there I continued plotting ways to get inside this enchanted kingdom of sleight of hand.  I sold my left kidney to a man named ""Little Bill"" in West Hollywood, I waxed all my body hair including my eye brows, and gave away my entire collection of micro machines, but still had no luck with tickets.  Actually I'm not sure why I did any of that stuff.  No one offered me tickets for any of it.  God, sometimes I'm so stupid.  Little did I know all you really have todo is call them up and politely ask how to get tickets.  If you catch the right person on the phone and it's not a busy day, usually they'll tell you to come on down.  If you get the chance, don't miss it.  Here's a tip, go for the magic and not the food.  It's bland.  But the magic is great.  And they have three different bars inside.",4 star rating

Screw Disneyland, this place is true magic!Ok, so many say the restaurant isn't all that....well what do you expect when they've got fairies and witches making this shit. c'mon. Personally, I haven't eatin there yet...so I shouldn't comment. What I can say is that this building is a laberynth of mirth and whimsy. Cluttered with goofy little bits of nostalgia and contraptions (you can't enter without saying hello to a dusty owl), tiny rooms with magicians of varying degrees of experteeese and posters of Doug Henning. Old timers sit at bar tables demonstrating card and coin tricks and whatnot. Better wear your best smoking jacket and double-winsored tie, cause jeans aint allowed. Drinks are small and expensive...but you'd pay the same for some watered down pepsi at California Adventure, so again quit your yappin.Too many things to describe here. Find yourself a person to get you on the list and spend the night checking out the different acts.Word has it that the lease on the place may be up soon and not renewed...so get yourself there before it closes, this is why i love Los Angeles.",5 star rating
1973,10/26/2007,"3.5 stars is the rating here. So there was a particular industry event here hosted last night, and to be fashionably hip... we decided to show up 1 hour after the designated start time.... BIG MISTAKE!!!  Valet parking was a mess (I know, I know... Valet parking.. normally I self park... but there was no immediate option). However, because the main service was full, they made us go all the way to the top of the hill and park at Yamashiro's (I didn't even know that this place was still around!!!! I took a girl on a date here back in my college days!).  So that was 1/4 mile away.  Supposely they had a shuttle that would take you back and forth, but it was a 4 door SUV and there were like 20 ppl in line.... F that... Once down at the venue, and once inside.. the place has got a billion different rooms.  The instructions to get to our particular party was confusing... there were several different magic shows going on (none of which I witnessed).  If you are a fan of the sleigh of hand (is that the right phrase?) and illusions.. this is the place.  However, to get admittance, you have to know a magician that is a member to this joint.  So not just anyone can be admitted.Also, getting here can be a challenge as it's a stone's throw away from the Hollywood Bowl... so concert night traffic sucks @$$.",3 star rating

1975,9/2/2008,"MAGIC INDEED!!I forgot much of a magic nerd I was. This place brought it all back to me.  I started remembering all of the magic kits, magic card decks, and magic books I had when I was a kid.  Yes, I love magic. I can't so much perform tricks anymore but I am totally entertained by those who can.  It was definitely worth the admission price to get in. Such a unique experience. I also forgot about the not taking pictures thing but quickly got reminded by members, but not in a mean way.I almost got lost going through all the narrow hallways and ""secret"" rooms. I was expecting more of the bars to be open, like the museum bar downstairs, but there was no one there. I enjoyed the owl bar and the most happening place was the bar around the player piano bar. The PLAYER PIANO... hahaha, so fun. Just thinking about it makes me laugh. I had a friend who just kept shouting things out to get the piano to play it and it just kept ignoring him. But if anyone else said it, it would play it. He was totally baffled and amazed by the power of the magical player piano.I don't like the fact that you have to wait in line for shows and there's a chance you might not get in. Luckily, we got in and waited for about 20 minutes. The performers are so amazing. They will totally knock your socks off! I recognized some actor in LA and I guess he's an amateur magician and performed a little card trick for us. Do:-Valet the car. It's $8 and totally worth it. No other parking around except the Hollywood and Highlands lot which costs money too. -Wait in line for the good shows. We saw a card magician, ""one of the best"" close-up magicians, and some amateurs. Sucks to wait, but gotta get your $25 money's worth.-Dress up. Not just for the dress code but it's special night out!-Talk to the other patrons, some of those people are interesting.  Apparently we met the owner or starter or the whole Magic Castle.

He read my boyfriend's!) However, the coolest part for me was MEETING Neil Patrick Harris...you know, Doogie Howser!?..How I Met Your Mother. He's on the board of directors and we found him down in a semi private room having a business meeting. However, he was MORE than happy to shake our hands and tell us a little about the place. With friendly people like him running the place, no wonder it was such a success with us. The food/bar was a little pricey, but to be expected. My boyfriend had the filet mignon and I had the chicken marsala. Both were quite good and the food presentation was nice. They have a very extensive wine list and several bars throughout the castle.

The performers are almost always magicians...I say almost always because they also on occasion will feature sideshow performances....how do I know this? well because I have been lucky enough to have the honor of performing at the Magic Castle on 2 occasions with my group The FreakShow Deluxe! and also world famous Todd Robbins whom I have enjoyed the entertainment of on a few occasions.The night will usually start off with you arriving in front of the castle...and yes my friends this place is a modern architectural marvel...okay so it's not Camelot...or Medieval Times in structure and representation...but imagine if you will and classy joint, where ladies where lovely dresses and guys sport suit and tie...sometimes even tuxedos. you are then ushered through a room in which with aid of the secret password you can gain access to the many bars and rooms that the Magic Castle has to offer. If you made dinner reservations then you will be seated and enjoy a meal prepared by the adjoining restaurant which in case you are out of the loop has recently been replaced. Apparently under new management the magic castle did not renew the contract of the restaurant that was up until recently a long time partner.So! because of this I can no longer tell you how the food is right now....the food of the old place was pretty good...but then again I wasn't paying for it and was appreciative of anything they brought down to feed us.I have performed in the Palace of Mystery which unless you ate dinner there and are guaranteed a seat...is sorta hard to get into (you wait in line in hopes that there is an extra seat left, or someone doesn't show up to the show to get in). I opened up fro magicians Fielding West and Shoot Ogawa...both fantastic magicians and very friendly people. As sort of a sneak preview for the patrons to let them know that my group FSD was performing downstairs.my group played in the parlor area next to the W.C.Feilds bar. (which we would later return to perform in during the Halloween season of 08')Anyway the rooms are awesome...the walls are covered in magician posters. As well as a few treats, in one of the bars located on the entry level floor you can find a ghost playing piano, a mysterious phone booth and a couple treats downstairs including an awesome selection of W.C. Fields short videos you can access with a push of a button.what would the magic castle be without secret rooms...and a secret library only accessible to members....a magic school is offered as well!anyway I guess I can go on and on about this place and the fun you will have as you goto rooms to see magicians perform their finest tricks...but also the walk around and close up magicians that can keep you entertained as you enjoy a drink from the bar as well.I think there are 3 main bars in this place 1 on each floor.magiccastle.comyou do have to be a member to make dinner reservations but if you know a magician or a member you can get in as a guest. Also there are special occasions in which you can make reservations member or not. (Rumor has it that under the new management, they are possibly considering letting this place be available on certain nights for the public, but again this is just rumor...so you ain't heard it from me)I think Sundays for the brunch you can make reservations even if not a member.cost to get in is $20 or $25..plus the cost of drinks and dinner...so this isn't a cheap place...but i figure if your all decked out anyway, well, live it up baby!  you are probably there for a special occasion anyway...why not go all out! tilt your hat buddy, order that drink on the rocks...and enjoy the show! This place I don't think was intended for just anybody to walk in and ""grab a beer"" so if you come here...you should know your shelling out some serious dough...I know I probably haven't talked about alot of the awesomeness here...but its' classy, friendly, swanky, and very debonair!Be sure to check out the website...because if I keep talking about this place some magicians might make ME disappear....ya dig?",5 star rating

1990,9/7/2009,"And for my next TRICK...i'll be reviewing the MAGIC CASTLEHollywood is known for its lavish style and old time glamor. What better way to show that in this turn of the century castle. Off Franklin avenue, you'll find a baroque exterior and subtle waterfalls as you drive up the curvaceous driveway. The affable clean-cut valet will open your door to a world of mystery and magic.OPEN SESAME!!!!Inside you'll find a magic club that is reminiscent of a secret hangout during the prohibition years. The restaurant upstairs offers prompt and professional service. This is to be expect as the price is relevant of its high quality service. Steaks and seafood fill their hefty menu with a few alternative choices for the picky eater in you. Generous portions will make your taste buds fall deeply in love with each groan of satisfaction.Be Sure to book your party early as the shows typically run early. Also make note that there is absolutely NO standing or saving seats for their first come, first Serve magic shows.I have been fortunate enough to have attended this magic club a handful of times during my life. I have always been impressed with the club's devotion to perfecting the art of magic. You will come across many tricks that you have seen before as a child but with an entirely different twist and style that will live you in awe and wonder.There are plenty of the magicians waiting around the bar and lounge areas to perform close-up tricks to give your visit a more personal touch. Just about all of their performers dazzle you with quick-witted humor and mind-blowing illusions.If you ever get the chance to visit the magic castle, make sure you visit IRMA, the piano ghost to amuse with an encyclopedia of music on her grand piano.

1993,3/22/2010,Similar concept as Disneyland's Club 33 - one can only come here if you're invited by a magician or if you know a friend who knows one that can invite you. There is a strict dress code for gentlemen where jackets are required but they do have some on hand should you fail to get the memo. Once in the castle you're allowed into the dining room exactly on the dot of your reservation. Camera and other photography is not allowed but they will gladly come by take your picture and charge you for it should you require a souvenir. The menu is not very extensive so I chose the filet since I knew that couldn't be butchered too badly since kitschy themed restaurants are always hit or miss. Thankfully my steak was cooked just right and my meal ended being quite enjoyable. After dinner you're invited to walk around to the different shows and rooms. We were able to see all the shows that night since we had dinner at a reasonable time. The shows were nothing extravagant. Don't expect Lance Burton or Chris Angel type Vegas magic shows or you'll be very sadly disappointed. The shows were more what I would call amateur shows. They were still entertaining none the less but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again. It's a great one time experience if you haven't been but the food and the shows weren't so awe inspiring that I would be begging my friend to invite me back.,3 star rating

1997,3/5/2012,"In terms of the magic, I think this place is pretty entertaining.  Magicians are fun and present a lot of comedy with their shows which make it enjoyable.  In order to get tickets to the main show, you have to buy dinner which is extremely over priced for very very sub par food.  Although one of my friends who came a couple years ago said that the food definitely improved from what it use to be.  But if you think about how much show tickets cost, you're spending about the same amount so I guess it's not that bad.  Definitely worth coming if you've never been, I'm not sure I was impressed enough to drop that amount of cash to come for a 2nd time.",3 star rating
1998,2/2/2012,"Mediocare food meets outdated magic. We went here about 4 years for magic and it was pretty fun the first time. Went again last night and the magic has not changed or has gotten worse. The food is NOT good. The server was rushed to take our order. The food is definitely prepared in advance as another reviewer mentioned. It is not only cold, but it comes out a few minutes after you order it! The drinks: the server asked just once and refused to take another drink order until I went to order myself at the bar. Salad: drenches with so much dressing, it is hard to eat! Not much you can do with salad, but it just had that feeling of pre-packaged salad.Appetizers: had the corn ravioli and caesar salad. They were OK, salad again drenched in so much dressing. Dinner: Roasted chicken was dry and cold. Brought out quickly after we ordered so definitely pre-made. Filet was decent, also not hot enough.Dessert: Nice to bring an ice cream on the house for a bday.Magic show: We were told we'd get tickets to get in the front of line for the main magic show. Didn't get it and we were told they decided not to do that for that night since it wasn't crowded. We ended up in the back of the line, but still had good seats because it wasn't crowded. The show itself was OK. The magicians are funny and the magic shows are just outdated (the rope, the rings, etc.)The class of people there are suprisingly low given the attire and exclusivity of the show. At one point, we heard these two guys talking about how one of them let out this ""fart that was so loud"". The people certainly don't match the attire. The servers and busboys were all talking beside the dinner table loud in Spanish. It's just not proper for a dinner for two that costs over $150 with drinks.We won't be returning. It's acceptable if it's your first time, but don't get your hopes up for a magical night. It's just whatever.",2 star rating
1999,11/20/2011,"This place was a disappointment. The concept is great. Dress up or you are not let in and enjoy magicians up close or see magic shows on stage. Enjoy food and drinks. Sounds great, right? I went on a Saturday and it was so crowded. We spent most of our time waiting in line for a show, then standing on tip toes to see magicians. The biggest disappointment was the overpriced and gross food. I ordered the salmon and the lobster mac and cheese. Both came out cold. After paying over one hundred dollars to see one show from the back of the room, valet parking, cold and disgusting dinner and having sore feet from tip toeing to try and see a card trick, I felt totally ripped off. The Magic Castle sucked the magic out of my evening.",2 star rating
2000,3/4/2010,Whao...it's been how many years I haven't been back to the castle???Still remember that 'seasame' door at the entrance. Still remember that ghost piano plays whatever songs U told it. Still remember different rooms have different magic shows. What a memorable nite....,5 star rating
2001,6/2/2010,"Dinner - umm.. quite horrible to be honest. I got the vegetable lasagna dish and I wanted to throw it up in my napkin. Sorry. There was this weird Merlin character walking around singing Happy Birthday which got quite annoying when you're trying to have a nice dinner.Shows - The shows made up for the food and I was fortunate to be a part of a card show. It was quite embarrassing at first, but I had a lot of fun. I forgot the magicians name, but it was the act put on in a room left of the bar. I really enjoyed it! The main show was amazing and it was this magician from Las Vegas -- he pulled a bunny in half to make to bunnies! AMAZING!It's a bit cold in the castle so I'd recommend bringing a jacket if you're wearing a cocktail dress. Men, don't forget to bring your ties!",3 star rating
2002,9/13/2011,Had a Company Festivity there on 9-10-11 whole place to us!!! Was AMAZING. Had a food buffet. Steamed salmon was to die for mashed potatoes delicious! Drinks are VERY stiff! Which is a plus! Had 3 and i was good! Magicians were awesome! Invisible Irma playing the piano even played Poker Face! !!! Totally awesome! I even had a conversation with her. Lol kinda weird speaking with a piano but we understood each other by me asking questions and she'd respond back. Weird i know! LoL. Houdini room has really cool artifacts all around! Magic that leaves you saying what! Howd he do that! Overall great experience that everyone has to see atleast once. Members only club but you can ask the front door lady for passes n she will give em to you! Awesome!,5 star rating

2004,10/29/2013,"Couldn't wait to come here and made a commute to come here. Made reservations three months ago. So this was long awaited. We get there and we see most people were in costume. We were like... wtf is going on. Sure enough it was a Halloween special night and you had to be in costume for entry. So, we wasted our time getting all fancy to meet their strict dress code for nothing. Wasted time and gas to get here to find out that they failed to mention this small little detail. Oh, and by the way, it was double cover charge too-$50 a head just to get in the door. Well we went to tell a manager how we were uninformed of this and wanted to make sure that they weren't going to charge us for canceling, because we didn't cancel... we showed up and they failed on their end to mention this. It's not even indicated on the tickets or email confirmation that we received- nowhere. Well, we had the pleasure of dealing with CHRIS HAGGER who ended up being a complete D-bag. No customer service skills whatsoever. He made a comment that 'obviously everyone else knew about it and how we didn't?'. He said they've been doing this for 50 years so we should have known... Right because we've attended here for fifty years. Try again, this was our first time. Even the member who had us attend didn't know about this costume deal let alone requirement for entry. Now, we are being charged 200 for 'canceling' because they failed to tell this to us and we got screwed in every possible way. Chris even followed us out after trying to discuss this with them and said because of how we acted that they would take the membership away from the one who referred us. Perfect, so he had to throw his last words in to make us feel like $hit that we'd be the reason the membership was revoked. Good try a-hole. Our background is customer service and we were treated like dirt. I don't care that this is a private club, show some class. Any manager of a business that accepts this sort of behavior from an employee deserves to get canned too.",1 star rating
2005,2/2/2014,"Not gonna lie, I am a bit disappointed by this place. I like the building, the architecture, the inside, the decor, the place is over a 100 years old, and in L.A that def. counts as "" old"", but besides the atmosphere , I expected to be "" blown away"" by the magic shows, I mean isnt that why there is a $30 per person entrance free ??? My opinion is that the magicians were more like comedians than magicians, and the tricks are the type of tricks you have seen a 100 times before, you know, the types of tricks thata  were "" so cool"" when you were about 5 years old ( cards, ropes, more cards, u get the idea). We had  dinner reservations, and the food was good, not spectualar but def. good, our server was great, and I wish we just had stayed at the dinner table drinking and chatting, instead of wasting time wandering around the mansion, for whatever shows. It was really packed on a Saturday night, and please note that the crowd is an old crowd. We are talking 80% 45 and over. The place is cool, go there if you have some type of deal not to pay the entrance fee and eat dinner. One time, just do it. They took my jacket away from me, cuz it had a zipper, though it was pretty stylish. Guys had to wear a suit and a tie. Hostesses : a bit rude and full of it, but what do you expect from Hollywood ? Dinner for 5 and some wine came to about $400.",3 star rating
2006,7/2/2013,"Absolutely fantastic place to go to for a date.  I was lucky enough to be able to come here twice already.  I would give this place 5 stars, however their food isn't great.  The first time was slightly better than the second...I must say I was tempted to give 3 stars if it would only be food alone.The magicians are great as are the drinks.  The first time we were there, food was just meh.  Nothing special and fairly overpriced, which I guess I'm not surprised since everything there is slightly more expensive.  The second time we were there though, we had a group of four.  ALL of our food came out cold.  Of course the waiter apologized and claimed that he had picked up the food as soon as it was sent out (in which case they need a better microwave).  He allowed us to have two desserts on the house which was nice I guess, though a discount would have been better since at that point the last thing we wanted was dessert.Either way, I will definitely keep coming back just for the magic.  It is truly a unique place that you will never find anywhere else.  I just wish that nonmembers weren't forced to buy the dinners for the show tickets....and if you want to force us to fork over the money, at least put out some better quality food.",4 star rating
2007,1/3/2012,"We arrived at Magic Castle with high expectations due to all the top reviews here. Private club, members only blah blah blah...First impression was ok, friendly valet service.When I came in the front entrance all I saw was old shabby furniture, well, now you can say it's 1920's chic, but really it had nothing to do with 1920' vintage atmosphere...I thought it all looked just run down!We went up stairs so see the first show half an hour before it started. After about 1 hour wait time, they finally started letting people in but now this, the room was full and we didn't get to see the show and would have had to wait another hour!!So we went to the next room to see a show, had to wait another hour again. This time we got in.The show was really below average...I mean, maybe I'm spoiled but I've seen way better magic in Vegas or just in simple circus shows...Next show was a close up show after another 45 minutes wait...it was a fun show because the magician was funny, but the tricks, again were average card tricks you can google anywhere!For me personally, it was a pretty boring night with poor magic tricks, I saw only 2 shows and spent ""waisted"" more than 4 hours of my life.",2 star rating
2008,6/5/2011,"I LOVED this place! It was more than I even imagined.First, they are strict on the dress code, men ties, ladies skirts or business jacket/slacks.  It was fun dressing up and it added to the red-velvet/old hollywood atmosphere. Second, the food was spectacular-I had rack of lamb as my main dish and our group had portabello mushrooms and calamari for appetizers. For dessert I had creme brulee-yum! All very tasty.Finally, the show was amazing.  The tricks were impressive and it ws nice to see how magic has taken a whole new turn-its not the same ole bunny out of a hat or lame card tricks.  All the magicians were good/great and each had a hilarious sense of humor.  We were rolling in laughter all night long.All in all, a wonderful 5-star experience!",5 star rating
2009,8/24/2008,This is the third time I have been here and the second time I have had dinner. This places exudes Old Hollywood and that is the end all be all for me. My Prime Rib was very good as is the dessert we had. Drinks are pricey but no more pricey than you would find anywhere else in this part of Hollywood. Two of the three acts were very good. The third act was by this wanna be Hollywood actor who bragged about some role he had on a shit MTV show I have never heard of that was being being a total primadonna before he would perform. Avoid him like the plague if possible. Everyone needs to come here once. It is in the rules of being from Los Angeles.......,4 star rating
2010,4/22/2009,"Definitely a fan of Magic Castle. My friend was in town and I wanted to give her a very special exclusive-to-Los-Angeles experience and this place definitely delivered. She loved the idea of the open-sesame bookcase. Dinner was very nice, I just wish they had more dinner options. Lots and lots of red meat but low on the semi-veg menu. However, its main attraction is not dinner, it's magic!! I was impressed with the close-up gallery and the prestidigitation act. I was even chosen for one of the acts. I have an excellent poker face, but the ""mindreader"" was able to figure out the answer anyway. HOW DO YOU DOOOOO THAT?! The main act was...alright, I guess, compared to the rest of the experience. Expensive, but a wonderful time for a special day. I found the staff pretty friendly and helpful. A couple of times I thought to myself, ""Get over yourself"" but there's one on every staff.

2012,5/12/2010,"Went to Magic Castle (18+) located in Hollywood with 2 of my friends and their husband/boyfriend. The Magic Castle is a private club, allowing entrance only to members (magicians) and their guests. We saw a couple of magic shows, had a nice dinner, and drank at several bars in the castle. Attire: A jacket and a tie was required at all times, and those that had forgotten to adhere to the dress code was offered a tie and a jacket.Food:Dinner here is pretty so-so. I had some fries, 2 plates of calamari, seared ahi-ahi sashimi, couple by a glass pinot noir to drink. During dinner, our magician friend had to leave for another appointment but promised to be back in an hour. Guys, if you ever do get invited to this place, always remember to get a map or a magician friend to take you around. We got lost quite a few times. Consisting of 6 stories and 12 different areas of interests, it was easy to get lost in the huge crowds of people.Our first show that we watched was in the basement of the chateau, with Michael Carbonaro and Frank Olivier. Michael Carbonaro presented a stunning show using shaving cream to form many different faces ranging from famous celebrities to movie characters. Frank Olivier's performance consisted much of juggling of various kinds, which I found sort of boring. Disappointed that the first show didn't have any magic, I ordered a Mai Tai and moved on to the next show. The next show was called the Rudy Coby Experiment. Rudy Coby's magic tricks were pretty awesome, where his theme consisted of combining magic and science together. It was a good night, one that would be hard to forget. Waiting in line for these shows were awesome too, since many of them were magicians that introduced the tricks that they performed.Overall, it was a good experience worthy of maybe doing again, albeit you will spend some money here so do come prepared.  I'm not a magic aficionado at any length, though if you are, it is worthwhile to check out.",4 star rating

2015,1/13/2011,"Let's be honest here: the Magic Castle is a dying animal. Do I recommend people go? Maybe. It wouldn't be the stupidest thing to do. But those who do go should know what they are signing up for. First, customer service: it's slow, lousy, and has the same feel as the pretentious employees at high-end department stores who could never afford the clothes they sell. And I suppose this also falls under customer service: the dress code. It's outdated, antiquated, and yes, sexist. I get that they want to class it up  a bit, but the whole notion of gender-appropriate attire is as antiquated as the location. It irks me. On to the food: it sucks. Really, it does. At best it's edible. In no way does the quality of the food match the price attached. I'm convinced that the Magic Castle is aware of how bad the food is, and thus they ensure they have diners by forcing you to gnaw their gross bits if you want to get in and see the magic. If you can avoid eating here, do so. The drinks: watered down and as insipid as their superannuated bar tenders. It takes more than a grinning ninety-year-old in a bow tie to please me.  They charge you what the whole bottle costs for a single drink. It would be nice if they added some of the alcohol they charge for. The magic: it's not bad. Good some might say. I wasn't impressed but I did have a good time (there should be a way to rate the venue aside from the magic). It's the only saving grace this place has. Overall, this place is only worth the trip to say you have been. That they are a Hollywood staple is the only reason they are still around. Go to say you have been. Go with a date who is a bit duller than you are and far less discerning. But don't go and expect this place to live up to the hype. It had a heart attacked and died while I wrote this review.",2 star rating
2016,3/21/2011,"Just went Saturday night and to be honest, I wasn't very impressed. It's a cool venue and it's fun to get drinks there and lounge around. The Palace show was weak. The main act was decent but the act before and after were not impressive. I actually felt like I was going back in time with those acts. The food is WAY overpriced for what it is. I must say, the truffle fries and cappuccino ice cream was DELISH but my prime rib was cold when it arrived. The risotto was good too. And the service was whatever; not impressive at all for what you are paying. All in all, I'm glad I came so I can say i've been but I doubt Id ever come back.

But as soon as you walk in, your cramped in a hot, old, grandpa's basement bar like place with odd paintings on the wall.  Very old Fashioned. The food was waaaaay over priced then what you pay for. I spent 30 bux on salmon and mash potatoes which was a small serving. Outback Steakhouse has better salmon and mash potatoes for half of the price. The freakin waiter took forever with our bill and the dude didn't even know magic. Rip-off. The shows were alright. I catched three shows. Nothing mind-blowing. There were funny at times. But again nothing to go gaga over. ""The No Show"" was the best show in my opinion. The handsome jack dude was alright. And the third guy was kinda boring.The drinks were expensive but they are strong. And there is a lot of small bars everywhere.Not a place for my liking.

2025,4/14/2010,"Definitely an enjoyable place to come here for some good ol' fashion Hollywood glamour.  Magic Castle is known for being exclusive but it seems like everyone and their moms know how to get an invite.  (You have to know a magician or a member).  But having an invite doesn't immediately get you in. You also need to pay a $20 entrance fee and buy a fairly costly dinner.That's not to say that the dinner isn't DELICIOUS.  Famous for their steaks, I went for the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus.  My fairly large strip of steak was absolutely delicious. Every bite melted in my mouth and was seasoned to perfection.  Good steak really is a rarity.  I am pleased to say that I finished every last bite of my dinner even though my stomach was already itching in anticipation to burst out of my too-tight cocktail dress.  We were also served salads as appetizers and I also had a glass of cabernet sauvignon that was a sweet companion to my dinner. My dinnermates ordered fresh oysters that tasted like, ""they just came out of the ocean minutes ago."" (her words, not mine)After dinner, we enjoyed a lovely evening filled with magic and tricks.  Each magician had their own unique, entertaining personalities and whether the tricks be marvelously outlandish or just a good ol' card trick, I was amused the entire night.",4 star rating

2030,9/12/2011,"I had pretty high hopes for this place after hearing rave reviews from several friends.  Maybe I've watched too many David Blaine and youtube magic tricks, but this place was awful. Seriously.  I came with a group of 7 people. It was Monday with a MNF doubleheader so we started the night at the pub downstairs to grab a drink and catch some of the game.  It started out great - the drinks were stiff, they had a couple of LCDs in HD and get this - they had an unlimited chili dog bar for $5.  Or so they say.  Now, there's no better way to get me excited than telling me I can have unlimited chili dogs for $5.  I scarfed one down before we went upstairs for the real dinner.  The dress code and dinner prices at the Magic Castle are as everyone else described.  Formal (jacket and tie for guys, dresses for girls) and expensive ($30-45 per entree).  The food was whatevers as my friends had warned, and we were required to order at least 1 entree or two appetizers per person.  I was expecting this so it didn't bother me.  Besides, I had 4 chili dogs waiting downstairs for me.  After dinner we watched the main show.  The host and the first performer spent about 45 minutes doing dumb dances and juggling rubber balls.  I'm not even exaggerating there was literally little to no magic at all.  If I knew that was what the show was going to be, I would've gone to 3rd street and watched that shit for free. The host did 1 unexpected trick with a bowling ball, but seriously, that was it.  The audience seemed to be about half actual audience / half ringers because there were a couple of people eating that shit up.  Maybe they're just easily entertained or have never left the house before that night, but you could literally find better acts at the mall.   The 'headliner' was said to be the first black magician to ever win some kind of award in Monte Carlo so in my head I was thinking, 'finally, some real magic'.  The dude came out and proceeded to pull comatose looking doves out of his sleeves and wave around his scarf.  He did the 'pour liquid into a newspaper' trick too.  Let me guess, you're going to shake out the newspaper and the liquid won't come out.  Then you'll fold the newspaper back up and pour the liquid back into the cup. My mind is blown! The only unexpected trick he did involved a white cat that he pulled out from some pocket at the end of his set.  After the show I was pissed.  WTF was that and why were people clapping? I thought this place was a magic castle. We watched some other guy in the hallway do some card tricks.  Some were cool, others just didn't make sense and he started to get snippy with the participant who questioned his wack trick.Completely underwhelmed, I was still ready to forgive the Magic Castle because I could still catch the 2nd half of the doubleheader downstairs and enjoy some more chili dogs and beer.  Only not.  We head downstairs and find that the chili dog bar is gone.  Not a hot dog in sight.  I ask the bartender 'WTF BRO?' and he tells me 'Oh, I'm so sorry, we cleaned it up after the first game'.  I ask if he can just grab me a couple from the back and he says no, they're all gone.  WTflaj;oidjf ;lksdjf??? The one positive aspect of the entire night just turned into the biggest fucking fail.  How are you going to sell me an unlimited chili dog bar for $5 and not even mention to me that it's going to end by the time I get out of the first fucking show? Mind you I just fucking paid $5 for 1 small chili dog. I enjoy getting dressed up, but my night at the Magic Castle was by far the biggest waste of a dry cleaned 3 piece suit that I've ever experienced.  ABRA CADABRA YO.",1 star rating
2031,3/24/2012,"AMAZING!! That and similar words were coming to my head as I was leaving this place. I think I saw a total of 4 shows. I really liked the 3 small shows. They were incredible. The main event was ok but I didnt like it because I was able to see through the tricks. The show with Toto was AMAZING! The other two small shows were pretty good too but they were mainly card tricks but with Toto, you are definitely going to get mind-f**ked.I will agree that would is overpriced consideration the taste of the food but you also have to take in consideration of the environment as well. The service was excellent, the castle is well maintained and very clean. Drinks are overpriced but that's normal so nothing to complain. Full Bar and extremely nice service. Valet parking, formal attire REQUIRED and the staff is here very polite. No photography allowed. Best part about this place is invitation only or membership required.

Thus I spent all my 20s and half of my 30s without ever visiting the mysterious and allusive magic castle. However, thanks to the magic of facebook I posted my status as wondering if anyone knew of anyone who was a member or a magician and surprisingly several people responded. Thanks to Ben Roman who works at the magic castle I was able to finally accomplish my quest to visit the castle with a good amount of my friends at hand. Now going to the magic castle is not cheap. On weekends its 25 bucks for entrance (and when you go you see why). You also have to come in a coat and tie for guys. Dresses, pant suits and heels for women. I actually enjoyed dressing up for the magic castle because you feel like you are attending a sophisticated private party. Parking is valet as well.To enter the Magic Castle you must say Open Sesame to gain entrance, which is a nice touch. You also find out the president of the magic castle is no other than Neil Patrick Harris. Yes that one. Supposedly he comes there on Tuesdays and lets you take pictures with him (photography is not allowed in the magic castle). If one is not familiar with magic castle, one could practically get lost (good thing I had a map) for it is rather large and the dimensions are quite strange. The interior has a early 1900s feel to it, with bookcases, painting and elements of magic everywhere, as well as several bars to get your drink on. There are also magicians all around who can show you a card trick or two. There is also Mona, a ghost piano who can play you a tune by giving her ghost bird cage a buck or two. Before we got our magician fetish on, we had dinner at 8 PM. For future reference I must come earlier or lie to my friends to come early to the magic castle. If you have a reservation that day, you can come anytime and see some early magic before you have dinner (if you make dinner reservations). Unfortunately came close to 8 and thus no early magic until later. Anyways back to dinner, our waiter was pretty funny and witty and always attentive. Now we had a big table and we were kind of squished against each other both to the back and the side (not good). Ordered some appetizers, the cheese bread and Truffle Fries. The cheese bread was goodand the Truffle fries were quite divine, wish we had ordered more. Being the chicken eater I am, I ordered the Roasted Chicken with Risotto. The Risotto was tasty but my chicken was rather dry and that was actually the only real down part of the evening was the food, pricey and not too special. However, the Magic presented by the magicians after was awesome. I was actually honestly left mesmerized wondering how did they do that. We checked out the main show where we saw Losander and his amazing levitation tricks. I wish I could remember the other magicians I saw, for they equally amazing and left me with my jar wide open in puzzlement of how they did that and as well left me in stitches with their comedy factor. So hopefully I get another chance to go to the magic castle, because it was quite an a fantastic experience.",4 star rating
2033,9/15/2014,"elementary magic, the classiest thing in the place was our attire. They make you dress like a wedding reception, then the entertainment is gutter humor. Im no prude but I could have tolerated that low life humor in jeans. Wished I was across the way at Hollywood Bowl for entertainment matching my mandatory dress code!",1 star rating
2034,8/3/2013,My favorite part of the experience was getting to experience the decor inside of the magic castle! The magicians seemed to be hit or miss the night we went. There were two that were excellent and the others were just ok. I was dissapointed that most of the magicians were only doing card tricks. It would have been more exciting to see more dynamic acts.,3 star rating
2035,7/21/2012,"LOVE IT!!!We went to this place yesterday to check it out. We got an invitation more 2 years ago but all of our friend who went there told us that this place is ""alot of noise out of nothing"", that this place is overpriced and customer service is bad. That's why we didnt want to spoil any evening and never went there. But yesterday we did and  it was on of the greatest experiences in Los Angeles.First of all, the reservation over the phone was not very warm: We needed  to give them all our information and the information of the member of the club who invited us and also our credit card #. And ""sweet"" girl warned us if we will not show us they would charge us $15.  (I read several reviews about mistreatment  - and the reservation part was a little scary)But After we went inside everything was just great!The diner was wonderful. my caprese salad and stake with mushed potatoes were phenomenal! wine was great.Surprisingly, the prices were very  cheep. all appetizers were $6 only (I read some reviews claiming food here was overpriced  - really?? Mcdolands prices for high end organic food!)After the dinner we went to look around. I found the design of this place was really interesting. It feels claustrophobic  - all rooms and stairs are small but if dont think about fire or shooting, it is more cozy then creepy.  There were plenty of magicians who were entertaining the public in every room: downstairs, upstairs everywhere we went to.Also we got tickets to the main show - Great! my bf didnt like it he said they had cheep tricks - but I was really amazed by he guy with pigeons. I also was invited to the stage - we were sitting in the first row.  - now I can put on Facebook what I was performing on the stage in Hollywood - kidding.The guys with cards was pretty awesome too. It was a show of two Portuguese performers - they music taste is wonderful (I just fall in love in one song  - need to find it somewhere). The music and the light and the show were so natural that it feels like the magic is everywhere.And also we checked another show with the guy who put a nail in his nose. Pretty exiting too.The lesson I learn from my yesterday's experience: Never read the reviews with 1-2 stars - these people either cheep or just angry at everybody.Try every place you want to go and make your own opinion first! DOnt read other people's reviews, specially if they are less then 3 stars.This place is ""a must"" to try in LA.LOVE IT!",5 star rating
2036,8/27/2008,"My visit to Magic Castle was one of the most interesting dining experiences I have ever had.My friend's friend works there and invited us (it is invitation only or membership). The castle is amazing, it is like stepping into a different dimension, some of the portraits on the walls have moving eyes. It seems easy to get lost in. I saw 2 acts, one was a card magician, very good with a Vincent Price feel. The other was a bit strange and over-done with disappearing acts and such, picking members from the crowd. Still, I enjoyed it.The food, meh at best. I had a seafood special and it was pretty standard. The service was excellent, though, from the minute we stepped in until leaving. It's not really about the food here, though. The ambiance and magic are the spotlight. It is a true Hollywood treasure. If you get invited, do not miss the opportunity.",5 star rating
2037,11/5/2009,"I first became a member of the Magic Castle in 1981.  I was a regular performer up there working the Parlour of Prestadigitation (which incidently is French for ""Last room in the back)  I moved away from Los Angeles in 1989 (smartest move) to Nor Cal.I have come back to visit about 3 times a year now.The Castle to me is home away from home.  My fellow compers are just as willing to show their latest feat of close up magic now as they were then.   The restaurant:  OK, I am not a food snob.   I was very happy with everything I have eaten at the club.  One visit, I was told to try the Beef Wellington.  Man, it was YUMMY!!!  And appitizers and sides were equally dellicious.  Try the Sweet Potato Gratan side dish.  It is something to be shared.  There are also ways to keep the food bill down.  My last visit, I had the Caprese Salad (the Italian one with the tomatoes and Mozzarella and Basil) and the lobster bisque soup with garlic bread.  total bill under 20.00 and you still get the ""ticket"" to the Palace Show.  I do not drink alcohol, so I opted for the Ice Tea.  It is a unsweetened tropical flavor and really complimented the meal.  Dessert, try the creme brule.Dont drink?  you can always go to the Owl Bar and order the Iced Tea.  The other bars dont stock it.Even though the staff has changed, there are still a couple bartenders who have been there going on 30 years.  It is nice to go to a bar where they remember your name even though you only visit 2 or 3 times a year!!",5 star rating
2038,6/13/2010,"My boyfriend and I were visiting LA from NY and we got the chance to go to the magic castle. We both really enjoyed our selves. The magic shows were entertaining and not cheesy. Another cool thing about this place is that not only are the magic shows going out but there are magicians everywhere. Some of them just do tricks at the bar. Even when you are just sitting down having a drink they have a ""ghost"" piano player that takes requests.We had dinner here and the food was pretty good. Both of us enjoyed our meal. I read a lot of reviews about the food not being good and I was definitely pleasantly surprised. Although its more about the experience then the food.

2041,1/22/2013,"Let's start with the highlights. More bars in one place than I've ever seen in my life (and fun to look at ones at that, which I'll call ""Titanic chic""). Magicians that blow your mind and also have a pretty incredible sense of humor at the same time. Friendly castle ""knights"" wandering around to give you more cool facts than you could find anywhere (they wear pins and will sense you're a beginner and steer you in the right direction). Small museum type areas where you can learn about the history of magic, the castle, a ghost piano player, and ... OMG, NPH just sat down next to my boyfriend and I in a suave tan suit sipping the fanciest cocktail I've ever seen making wonderfully witty jokes NEXT TO US! Jaw drops.The food to me was just okay, but you're not here for the food, you're here for the magic! Only one vegetarian entree (but you can order the Penne Vodka dish with veggies - just ask). I'd recommend getting there a few minutes before your reservation so you can take in the wonder of this place. It's sort of like magical speakeasy meets Disneyland meets every other awesome thing I can think of. With your dinner, you get two tickets to the main show, but if you can duck out of dinner quickly enough like we did, you can catch a show or two beforehand (my favorite room by far was the Parlour of Prestidigation, which seats about sixty and has a cozy intimate feel without being right on top of the people next to you). Near the Parlour, there's another staircase to a basement area which has the bar from Hello Dolly and Houdini's fish tank. By the entrance, be sure and visit Irma's piano, because she takes requests.According to one of the knights we met, it's best to go Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday (which I believe is member night) because it gets crowded on weekends. As for the magic ... I won't ruin anything - I'll just tell you it's awesome and I can totally see why Gob wasn't accepted into the Magician's Alliance. And okay, because of NPH, I would give this place 6 stars if I could.",5 star rating
2042,8/29/2011,"I've been to the Magic Castle about 5 times and have never written a review.  If you have an opportunity to get in, GO!!!!!!!!   The only catch is you need to know someone to get it. This is a private club not open to the public.  You need to know a member of the Magic Castle or a Magician.  It's an old castle on the hill next to Yamashiro restaurant.  They do have a restaurant you can make a reservation at and the food is so-so and  on the expensive side for what you get but the whole point is the honor of getting an  invite anyway. There is a cover charge to get in, I think it was about $30?!?  So it does end up being an expensive night if you buy dinner and drinks (they have bars all over the Castle).  The interior is phenomenal.  It's a bit scary because it has the whole ""magic"" theme with dark rooms and hidden areas and you are free to roam up and down the stairs and try to see every inch of the castle.  In various rooms they have magicians performing.  It could be a card magic table next to the bar, a small room of about 20 people in the up and close gallery or a much bigger room with a big david copperfield type magic show with the pretty female assistance, swords, lights and all the glam.  Everyone I've taken here has enjoyed it.  You have to dress up as  they have a pretty strict dress code - guys have to wear suit/tie and women must have a dress or pants suit on.  It is 21 y/o and over except for Sunday brunch.",5 star rating

You also have to wait in line for shows even though you are not guaranteed a seat.Food was overpriced for what you got. On a positive note, their cocktails were nice and strong.

2047,6/3/2012,"i had such a freaking fabulous time here. it's basically just a crazy fun house to run around. there are secrets and mysteries hiding in every corner, just waiting for you to be amazed. i had no concept of where i was, what floor i was on, or what room would be around the corner, which definitely added to the magical feeling. our party of 8 dined before hitting the shows. the food is generally average and way too expensive. i would avoid eating here - but the one perk is that after your meal they give you a special pass that lets you bypass the lines for some of the shows. after we were sufficiently fed and wine'd up, we started zigzaging through the castle and found ourselves in one of the main rooms where we were dazzled with a brother-sister act, comedy, ventriloquists, birds popping out of thin air. that show lasted about 45 minutes. we then roamed to find some smaller shows, all of which left me completely mystified. i was picked in two shows to be the magician's assistant! definitely try to be a volunteer or audience participant, it makes it much more fun. this was definitely a memorable night. i would say that you don't even have to be a fan of magic to enjoy it - just go for the experience and the allure of being befuddled!",5 star rating
2048,2/8/2011,"I loved the Magic Castle.I went on a Monday night, and unfortunately there were only about 50 people in attendance that night. The good side of this, was that my date and I had great one-on-one encounters with the magicians. The bad side of this, was that all of the shows after midnight were canceled- and the evening ended a few hours before I had hoped and planned. It's less expensive to get in on a weeknight ($20 or $25, versus I've heard  a $75 cover per person). But more of the castle is open on Friday and Saturday, so you'll get more bang for your buck in that regard (as well as there will be a full evening of shows to enjoy).",4 star rating
2049,5/27/2011,"The Magic Castle is a truly spectacular experience.  From the outside it is hard to imagine what you will find within.  Felt a bit like a theme park for grownups (21+ only) with a childish logo on a light-up sign, and looked pretty small from the outside.Once you enter, you realize that this isn't your typical night out.  ""Open Sesame"" opens the bookcase that allows you to enter a speakeasy-style bar and lounge.  There is something (or someone) interesting around every corner.  In one room you'll find a piano that plays what you ask it to. In the show rooms you'll be greeted with humor and amazing slight of hand.  The main show last night included doves flying out of fire balls tossed over the audience.If you're lucky (like we were) you'll be invited to a private show by a magician member that's looking to get in some practice and have some fun.  Sitting two feet from a man that can shake a deck of cards to organize it by color is pretty awesome.  And comedy seems to be a part of every show.Make sure to check the dress code on their website before you go.  It's pretty strict and annoying when you're getting ready to go out, but once you're there it's awesome to see everyone looking so snazzy.I hear that it's usually pretty crowded on the weekends and the occasional Thursday night.  You'll get the same shows every night of a week (I think), so if you want things a little less hectic, go on a week night.  I think the acts change on a weekly basis.The negatives are: you need a member to get in, or you have to be a guest at the hotel (and membership is about $1K/year I think).  The drinks are a bit pricey, but it's LA.  You can't save seats in the show rooms, so don't run off to use the restroom while your friends are in line! Mandatory valet parking, but it's only $8.Overall an amazing place that you shouldn't leave LA without experiencing.",5 star rating
2050,11/21/2013,"Absolutely horrible dinner experience at The Magic Castle. Lets get this out of the way, I myself am a restaurant manager but this was never known to The Magic Castle. This was a first time experience at The Magic Castle at the advice of my  partner.  In the mind of being on a nice romantic date, We Ordered a bottle of white wine for 2 people and was not given an ice bucket.  We received bread and then ordered an appetizer then entrees soon after.  Our server along with bussers walked by constantly never clearing any dirty finished plates.  By the time were were completely finished with our entrees we still had our now warm wine, dirty bread dishes, finished bread bowl, dirty appetizer plate and now our dirty entrée plates and still no one to take them away from our tiny 2 top table.  I had to get up and go to the host and ask for a manager, she said she was actually a manager. I explained what was happening and she had the nerve to tell a customer that it was ""because of a new busser"",  Anyone in the restaurant business knows you never place blame on others, you accept it and fix it, especially as a manager.  After a dinner bill of approx $80 a person she comp'ed a $8 creme brûlée and nothing more.  Our server then dropped the bill and never returned, I once again had to get up and go to the host desk to try and pay our $160 bill for a horrible dining experience.  The quality of the food was amazing and delicious, luckily for the restaurants sake the magicians were awesome and took some sort of attention off of the sub par dinner experience, for such a highly prestigious name as The Magic Castle this is terribly unacceptable.

2053,12/27/2011,"Magic Castle is, well, a magical experience... if you can get it.  After wanting to go for a few years, I finally met someone who knew someone who got me in.  The Magic Castle is a private club and strictly members and members + guests only.  In addition to that, there is also a strict dress code: coat and tie for the men and cocktail dresses for the ladies.  The dress code, in my opinion, added to the evening.  It added a formalness to the experience and harkened back to an earlier era which sets the tone for the evening.Onto the magic.  I was able to see 4 different shows, ranging from pretty darn cool to F-ing amazing.  The two shows at the top of my list (and must sees if you are able to get in) are The Close Up Gallery and The Parlour of Prestidigitation.  The Close Up Gallery is a small room seating around 20 people around a single Magician.  The show harkens to the name, as the audience watches a magician perform amazing slight of hand a couple feet from you.  The front row is literally 2-3 feet away.  Wonderful experience.  The Parlour of Prestidigitation is the big show in the large room up stairs.  It seats probably 200 and consists of 3 magicians performing one after the other.  The shows here are much larger in scope and do involve a bit of pyrotechnics.  The other two shows I saw were good, but not at the same level.  One was in the basement and was another close up slight of hand show.  There were about 10 of us huddled around his table.  The show was good but I thought the magician was a little cheesy and over the top.  Same goes for the other show we sat it on at a table in the corner of the top floor.  The performance was good but it wasn't anything I hadn't seen before on TV or at shows in other places.The Magic Castle is a great place to visit as its filled with wonderful detail and trickery throughout from the book case you need to say ""Open Sesame"" to enter to Irma the invisible piano player who you can make song requests to and she'll play.  Also lining the walls are photos of performers from through the years... I do have to say I was pretty surprised to see the photo of Cary Grant in action (wish I could have snapped a picture of that).",5 star rating

2057,4/21/2012,"First of all I can tell that the way they handle guests is very poorly managed.  Its more like a cattle call than a fine dining experience with a show. A lot of the guests are friends of magicians or entertainers themselves so you have to deal with that sort of arrogance while waiting.  The wait staff was pleasant and the food although COLD was decent. The pricing is very high for what you get. The prime rib was flavourful but cold and on the tough side.  The lobster mac n cheese was cold and dry and so was the regular mac and cheese. I can usually put up with some minor inconveniences but for the price, it should have been much better. This place needs to treat their clients and guests with a better overall experience.  It was more like a Bar/ restaurant with some card tricks thrown in.  I am sorry but a dress code for this place is unnecessary since you are treated like cattle and not a guest. The seating for the main show is cramped and more akin to a Jr High play. While we were waiting for the main show we wandered through some of the smaller rooms to enjoy the close up magic.  I was sorely disappointed as the performers seem to have a ""what do you want from me"" atitude.  We grabbed some coffee as it was getting late and we wanted to be alert for the performance.  The coffee was cold and stale.  They do not seem to lack guests as it is a very busy venue.  The high pricing does not justify how guests are handled.  I doubt that I will go back.",2 star rating

The magicians were awesome - I'd gladly give them a billion stars if I could! I'm still amazed by the guy who tore up a newspaper right in front of our eyes, then blew on the pieces and held up a complete newspaper once again. Mind-boggling, I tell you! Aside from the super-cool magic shows, nice bartenders, and the knowledge that you're in some exclusive ""castle"", however, I can't say that I'm a fan. Words that come to my mind when I think of the Magic Castle are ""pretentious"", ""prissy"", and ""please just calm the f*ck down"". Guys, you can't even take your jacket off when going to the bathroom, or someone will scold you and tell you to put it back on. Also, don't have too much fun, lest you raise your voice...I'm sorry - I think my memory of our evening has been tainted by our server, who was unnecessarily condescending throughout our entire dinner. Yes, we only ordered appetizers and sides as opposed to three-course meals, but it was because we had been forewarned that the food was sub-par! I don't mind paying high prices for guaranteed deliciousness, but this place is known for magic, not food. (On that note: don't order the lobster bisque - sodium overload!) For the most part, I ignored the snide remarks and the eyeball-rolling of our server, but what really made me upset was when he brought out our bottle of wine along with 6 glasses, then asked, ""Will everyone be having wine?"" When I replied yes, he gives me a look and asks, ""You know that a bottle of wine only serves 4 people, right?"" ...WHY DID YOU EVEN BOTHER BRINGING 6 GLASSES THEN? And isn't it really up to us to decide how many people a bottle of wine will serve? We each just wanted a little wine to toast the birthday boy with! Oh, and here's the icing on the cake: When my friend told him that it was his birthday, our server replied, ""Good for you!"" and walked away.Whew...it feels good to finally let that out.

2060,2/2/2015,"Been wanting to come here for years, finally made it.  Stayed at the Magic Castle hotel next door (highly recommend - friendly and convenient). We got there at 6:00 for 8:00 dinner reservations and it was just about the perfect amount of time to wander around at a leisurely pace and see most of it. We got in two shows before dinner, then the main show, then the magic piano afterwards, always with a drink in hand. Small shows were intimate and quirky.  Everywhere we wandered there were friendly staff and beautiful old bars, it was a very relaxing and fun evening. Husband found the suit and tie requirement annoying - it's not his usual t-shirt/cargo shorts crowd for sure, and the dinner was overpriced and beautiful as expected but tables were crowded together very tight and food was disappointingly mediocre (excellent: crab coconut soup, honey citrus cheesecake, lamb was OK, lobster was dry and overcooked, side dishes all forgettable).  I found it annoying that I couldn't order the salad I wanted for dinner and had to go with a meat entrée (entree purchase required, no veggie options except pasta).  The server was very friendly but he never did produce the promised rolls and they would have been quite welcome with the soup.  The building is beautiful and I had fun dressing up for the occasion, we had a good time but it was quite expensive for the evening as a whole, don't feel the need to go back again.",4 star rating

2062,5/20/2011,"I was fortunate enough to have a friend who is a member who invited a group of friends for the dinner and show.  Overall, it is a very unique place and definitely a place that has been on my list for a while.  Before I delve into my review, I admit that we all had a good time and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Very few places in LA can compete with the ambiance and experience that Magic Castle provides. We started off with the dinner followed by the magic show.  From what my friend told me, the magic show can be a hit or miss depending on when you go and who is performing.  I also think that there is a strong correlation with the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream.Foodwise, the cheesy garlic bread was fantastic.  One of the best garlic cheese breads I have ever had.  Nice buttery flavor with pronounced garlic and super cheesy.  I think I could have eaten this forever.  I loved it so much I wanted to marry it.  The deviled eggs with truffle oil were also delicious with a wonderfully creamy texture.  I was surprised that I could even taste the truffle in it.  Tempura fries consisted of thick slices of portabello.  Not too bad, but definitely outshone by the other appetizers.  I had the prime rib which was something like 24 oz post cooking weight.  So being the fatty that I am, I didn't think it was too big since I had put away up to 40 oz at other steakhouses - yes that is a magic show in itself.  But this is usually a precooked weight.  So the prime rib was much larger than I expected. It looked so beautiful on my plate with all of its pink glory yearning to be ravaged by my mouth.  Wow, that sounded like a really cheesy line from a Harlequin romance novel. Unfortunately, it ended up being like many a tempting mistress - after the first couple of hits, it became tough and chewy and difficult to swallow.  Isn't prime rib supposed to be uber tender?  I think that they were anticipating a big event that night and cut the cooking time a bit short. So much for low and slow. My wife's fish (halibut) was sadly, fishy.  I could smell her dish from across the table.  I took a bite and afterward, it felt like I had just made out with the Little Mermaid.  I was expecting some great food, but didn't think that it was terrible - just average.Since I had a couple of drinks the magic show was pretty decent.  If I was sober it probably would have sucked. It's funny how I can be impressed by the smallest things when I'm drunk.  Speaking from experience, this can lead to disappointment when hooking up at nightclubs - by both parties.But the critic in me took the night off that evening and I still ended up enjoying myself.  So despite the mediocre magicians and meal, the overall experience of just being at Magic Castle has some value to it.  They will even hold your leftovers at the front reception for you as long as you label your food.  I suggest using the name ""Big Wiener"", so when the hostess asks you which one is yours, you can reply "" I'm the one with the Big Wiener!""",3 star rating
2063,4/1/2012,"The 5-stars applies to the whole experience, not particularly to dinner. Magic Castle is a strange melding of a Moose Lodge, roadside attraction, dinner theater, bar, and tourist restaurant. (with a jacket and tie dress code) Entrance is restricted to members and guests (ask your concierge). The food was way over priced, even for Hollywood. But the atmosphere and entertainment saves the evening. Do see: close-up magic, the piano, the stage show, (and once restored from the fire) the museum. Get your friend to sit in the second bar-stool from the left (you'll see). And, if you are into that sort of thing, keep an eye open for the occasional celebrity.",5 star rating
2064,6/10/2008,"I've been waiting forever to visit the illustrious Magic Castle. I finally got to go thanks to Steph W! She's an amazing artist who was showcasing her artwork along with others at the Magic Castle. First off, this place is not for bums or hobos. Valet is $8 for non-members. Admission is $25 per person for non-members. And this is with an invitation! Need I say ouch?Walking into the small lobby. I was impressed by the decor, it was Victorian-esque.  The first cool thing was saying ""open sesame"" and having the faux book shelf wall open up. People oooed and ahhed. We walked in and went right for the bar. I had the special ""Harvey Wallbanger"". It was tasty! We reviewed the magic show schedule and was hoping to see a show before our 8p dinner reservation. Little did we know that you had to get in line early and get a numbered ticket! So our little sad clown feet wandered around until we found the art gallery. We met up with Steph and Curtis. She was showcasing some very lovely lotus blossoms that had real gold leafing. We were impressed! The rest of the show had an eclectic mix of art. The mod matrix-styled clothing was a hoot! The duck themed stuff had us quackin! (Yes, I went there)Time for dinner at the swanky restaurant. We were seated and while perusing our menus, we were forgotten. Seriously, the waiter went around to the all tables around us like we were invisible. I was annoyed by the time he got to us. But I let it go because I didn't want to be in a mood at a nice place. But again, we were forgotten like the red-headed bastard step-child. After 30 mins or so, our food finally arrived. So my mood was teetering when I tasted the food and it fell. The steak was awful. It was dry and tasteless! Luckily we ordered the mac and four cheese. At least that was good. My guy had the prime rib and he enjoyed it. After shuffling my food around for a bit, we asked for the check. It seemed like everything took forever. I was very ready to leave. We skipped dessert since we didn't want to stay in the restaurant all night. --- The restaurant has this policy of holding your leftovers until you're ready to leave their place. What they don't tell you is they only pack the meats and nothing else! If we're paying for a fancy meal and have leftovers, I dang well want all my leftovers. I was pretty pissed off since it was the first time a restaurant has ever done this to me. Of course I didn't discover this until the next day. I was really looking forward to having some mac and cheese. I hate the restaurant!Now the fun part, the magic shows! Those were the best! We laughed and were flabbergasted! It made the awful dinner forgotten. We got to see the main show because we had dinner there. Then got to see another show before it got too late. Seriously magic is so amazing! The restaurant overpriced food and service deserves one star but the magic shows redeems it. Word of advice, skip the food and just go for the magic shows!",2 star rating
2065,1/22/2012,"If you know someone that can get you invited to it, by all means beg, lie and steal to go.  Did you know that head of the magical arts is none other then NPH? (Neil Patrick Harris). Per our waiter, he is usually there on Tuesdays, NPH! After you check in, you will walk toward a book shelf and say ""open sesame"" it will open and lead you into one of the bars. It's what I would think an eccentric magician's home would look like.I had the NY strip, while it's not listed on the menu, I'm fairly sure it's prime beef, I mean the grade of beef is not listed. When I first got it, I thought ""where is the steak sauce?"" After I had a first bite, I was glad there was no steak sauce. It was juicy, tender.. and while it sounds weird to write, it was ""beefy."" It had garlic mashed potatoes. I wish there was more garlic, but I'm a garlic man. The grilled asparagus were tender and surprisingly sweet. I'm considering getting a 1 month temporary membership just to have their steaks, they are very good.The magic castle, while an awesome steakhouse also offers more magic shows then you can see in one day. There are several magicians just hanging around everywhere willing to show you tricks and have a chat. No matter how old you are, you will feel like you are 5 years old again as you walk around. A lot of the magicians specialize in close up magic. I took part in some card tricks that I still don't know how they pull them off. I had the cards in my hands.. I shuffled them, all by myself. I cut the deck, all by myself. Then the magic happened.update for 4/1. This was the after party for the 44th Annual Academy of Magic Arts award. In no particular order. I got to talk to Jason Alexander and Neil Patrick Harris. I ate dinner with one of the award nominees and one of the winners. They showed me how to do a coin trick. I got to meet so many magicians and comedians. My head is still spinning. My guide was Steve ""the ventriloquist"" which is one of the most enthusiastic and nicest guys I've ever met. I'm a huge fan of Neil Patrick Harris (NPH!), so that alone made my night. The food for the night was a buffet, there were 3 stations. One for dinner, one for appetizers and one for deserts. I ate way too much, and all was very good. They had a mango gaspacho shooter. I would like to know how they make it, this is an awesome drink for summer. They do take pride in their food. I'm not a fan of salmon, but the baked salmon was very good, flaky and moist. My original statement stays ""lie, steal, cheat to get an invitation."" Steve, the guy that invited us, said that when you see someone with a gold lapel pin, they are magicians and will show you magic if you ask. They don't force it onto you, so you have to ask. If this doesn't bring your inner child, then nothing will. Close up magic is so trippy.. you are 2 ft in front of the trick, you don't blink... you are laser focus on the hands and BAM! you don't know how it was done... again, inner child.",5 star rating

2067,11/15/2010,"yeah, hey, this was kinda cool i guess. really nostalgic and i love anything that has ripley's believe it or not wallpaper (reminds me of Wendy's decor from when i was a kid). i was really expecting something spectacular like david copperfield or maybe a little more glittery like sigfried and roy - minus the mauling. but hey, it was cute for an evening out.  the food. really dated and has that mass produced feel to it. i mean it was edible, don't get me wrong, but it was more along the lines of airplane fare...the apps were pretty lame. french fries, sprinkled with parsley served upright in a cone, and cheesy bread. the fries were congealed goo, not crispy and not salty. the bread was cheesy but not very good. just filler food.the lamb was decent, but the horseradish it came with was a cheap sauce and not real horseradish. minus 1-. the accompanying risotto, borderline inedible. accompanying veggies i could've cooked better at home. filet mignon was decent, potato au gratin was not. very 1970's a la hamburger helper. came with a bearnaise sauce that didn't blow me away. i really get the feeling this place could use a new head chef to revamp the menu.  everything was just so underwhelming and had a cafeteria flare to it. but hey i guess when you're in the mood for magic, food doesn't really matter so much.PLEASE do NOT order the red velvet cake at all costs. cuz it be from costco. pure nastiness. the chocolate souflee w/ice cream was a little better but not much, so next time i'd make the dessert ""disappear into thin air"" from my bill, boyo. the wait staff was very nice, professional and adequate but my advice: STICK TO THE SIMPLE FARE - BURGERS AND FRIES ONLY.the magic show: 1st guy a little painful when he tried to memorize and recite 20 people's names, 2nd guy lots of birds. one was PINK! neat. i have to say i really like the little side shows. Bill Joslin was an adorable old-timer that kept talking about Frank Sinatra see? and ended all his sentences with ""see"" a la jimmy cagney. loved him, could've listened to him for hours. i dig old people especially cool ones.we were too tired to watch any more than 1 show and kind of annoyed by having to wait for the show to start.  they pack you into the room 20 min before the show starts and it is so absolutely unnecessary to wait that long. we really just could've been drinking at the bar or whatnot. so by the time the show started our group was hella rowdy and started heckling.... that was kinda funny but i also felt bad for the performers so i did not partake, being a fellow artiste and all.",4 star rating
2068,5/28/2012,While visiting my sister a few years back in LA we came here for Sunday Brunch. The place was packed in no time. The brunch was buffet style and it was simply delicious!!!

2069,4/5/2010,"When my boyfriend was younger, he wanted to be a traveling magician. This was a dream that would never become reality for him (at least not yet) but his love for magic never faded. So, with our 6 month anniversary approaching, I wanted to take him somewhere special where he would get to experience a night of top notch magic. Through some work connections, I scored a pass to the castle and made a reservation for dinner on Friday April 2nd. When I called the staff was nice enough and they quickly locked us in for 8pm. So I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was thrilled. I warned him about the dress code as a full suit is not what he normally packs for one of our weekends together. So the evening arrived and we got all decked out in our finest evening wear and headed over to The Magic Castle. We arrived around 7pm so that we could check out a show and some drinks prior to dinner. The valet took our car, we paid the cover and shouted the words ""Open Sesame"" at the bookcase, opening the doors to the famed Hollywood club. Wow, is the building spectacular. Hidden rooms all over, clever vintage decor though out the building, there is nothing like it. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by a woman who suggested we get in line for the next close-up show as the room fills up fast. It was 45 minutes before, but the room only fits 20 people or so, so getting in line early was key. We took our seats and she sent the cocktail waitress over to us to get our drink orders. The cocktail waitress was back in a flash with our drinks and before we knew it, we were seated in the tiny Close Up Gallery watching some awesome close up card tricks. After we finished the show, it was time for our dinner, so we walked right up to the host's stand and were seated immediately. The restaurant is pretty large and there were huge tables celebrating birthdays and special occasions everywhere. The service was consistently good throughout the night and though I see the mixed reviews on the food, our food was pretty fantastic. First up we had the portobello mushroom fries. Strips of mushroom fried in tempura batter and served with a spicy ponzu sauce. They are a great way to start a meal! Next up I had the fish special which was yellowtail served seared with a sesame crust, wasabi mashed potatoes and shitake mushrooms. The fish was great, and really high quality, which is necessary if you are serving it rare like that. However, my fish was a tad bit cold, so I think they should try storing it at slightly lower temperatures. I loved the mashed potatoes too. I had to try the lobster mac and cheese and though I did see some reviews noting the lack of cheese in this dish, I have to say I preferred it that way, it let you really taste the lobster chunks. Too much cheese would have eliminated the flavors completely. Since I am a dessert-aholic, there was no way I was leaving without dessert. I was tempted to go with my standard... creme brulee, but I decided to try something different and went with the banana cream pie. Oh my! The crust was made with crushed nutter butter cookies, and the filling was creamy. They finished off the plate with a banana that had a hard crunchy sugar crust on them... sooooooooo good. The dinner was surprisingly better than I had hoped for, and the price was not nearly as terrible as I thought it would be. The service was helpful and relatively quick considering the number of tables that they were serving at the time. At the end of our meal, we were given tickets for the big show and were sent on our way. We managed to squeeze in 3 shows total after dinner, including one where I got picked to go on stage!!! Somehow the magician got my $5 bill into a lemon, and when he cut it, it was all citrusy smelling!!! That was one of the coolest tricks I have ever seen! For the people who said that the magic is not as impressive as Chris Angel, and other Vegas acts, well NO SHIT, this is a small venue with magic, not huge illusions. Were you really expecting to see a multi-million dollar Vegas production at a small magic club in Hollywood. I mean really?!?As we left our final show around 12:45am, we walked into the main bar to find the place packed with guests and magicians everywhere!!! Thank you Magic Castle for making it such a wonderful anniversary for me and my boyfriend, it was a great time for both of us, and as long as I still know someone that can get me in, I will be coming back again and again.",5 star rating
2070,1/28/2008,"Magicians are hot!  You can do magic  (oh yes you can Mr Magician)You can have anything, that you desire (5 stars for you baby)Magic... (yes, give me more) and you know, You're the one who can put out the fire (porque? me gusto fuego papi!!)This place definitely deserves 5 stars (and I'm stingy with my stars), because only in America and only in LA can you find a place like this.  I have been wanting to check out the infamous Magic Castle for a long time now, and with a little magic conjured up by Kelly H, I had one of the best times in a house full of booze and mystery!Friends and I went on a Sunday night (day before MLK Monday) and it was a full house (haha, ok lame joke).  Ladies, be sure to wear comfortable shoes because you will be doing a lot of standing/walking and you might want to bring a shawl because it can get chilly in certain areas.  I recommend going with a member since they can explain the history of the place, fill you in on magician bios, and show you the secrets of the mansion without doing the whole tour thing.  It's easy to strike up conversation with anyone as guests and staff in the house are genuinely friendly (except the bartender in the main foyer who was being mr. meanface).  Like Judy H said, be sure to stand in line for one of the shows early enough so you don't miss out.  We got to see the performers: Lincoln, Pop Hayden, Eric Evans, Mystina, Christopher Hart, and Tom Ogden.  The shows were all entertaining and left you scratching your head on your way out.We didn't do the dinner, but from what I could see it looked like regular steakhouse style fare.  It smelled all right? *shrug*But I did get to try their appetizers: potato wedges and onion rings, and those were pretty tasty.  Drinks are pricey at $12 for Grey Goose, so naturally I did what any vodka loving lady would do... I asked for it straight up :o)Magic used to be dorky with overly exaggerated hang gestures, abracadabras, and pouffy haired assistants covered with sequins and feathers.  How times have changed!  These days magic is sexy and magicians are hotter!  I hope I will get another chance to visit the Magic Castle again... and maybe next time I'll get to work my hocus pocus on a cute magician? :: poof ::  *running away as a white rabbit*",5 star rating
2071,2/15/2011,"Went here for Valentines day with a party of 8, was insulted and treated incredibly rudely when the two women working the admittance desk, Ally and Stephanie, realized that one of our party members had forgotten his ID. I requested to speak to a manager so we could find a way to  admit my friend with the forgotten ID who had drove 45 miles to be there-Ally was rude, acted annoyed and at her wits end with us, and treated us like we were street urchin invalids. After awkwardly standing in the entry way waiting for a manager for 10 minutes, Jim a senior manager came to our rescue and agreed to our solution of letting our friend in with the exception that he would not drink for the evening. Thank you JIM!!! Ally and Stephanie continued to act huffy and snotty as they checked our IDs and took our money, until things really got extremely offensive and borderline abusive when Stephanie(her job was to run the register) let me know that she was friends with the Magician who had given us our passes to be admitted into the Castle and that she would be writing him a letter hearing from her about the fact that his guests arrived with a patron who had forgotten their ID.NOW that's when I got mad, along with my husband who was fuming but keeping his cool.....I told her in a very calm manner how rude of her it was to lay a guilt trip on us and make something that should be business, a personal thing.Alas, i believe these two young women treated us like the dirt on their shoes because we were young happy couples coming in to the Magic Castle with our Husbands to have a great night, when they both obviously were without positivity or love for anyone that night....We enjoyed everything else that night tremendously!!!!If you happen to go to the Magic Castle, don't forget your ID, otherwise you will be treated like a piece of crap by my new favorite people, Ally and Stephanie.",2 star rating

2073,5/31/2009,"One of the things you have to put on your ""List of LA Stuff to Do"". I don't even know where to start- first of all, this is a really cool private club in which you have to be invited by a member ( magical or non-magical) to go. I have received tickets before, where you pay a $20 entrance fee. Either way, it is an awesome experience and worth every penny.Walk in- valet the car, give your name at the counter, and slip inside via a bookcase with a secret entrance. (Classic) There are two Harry Potter books in the bookcase. Classic. Waltz inside the main bar- men in suits and women in dresses and even elbow -length gloves, drinking and watching magicians doing tricks up close.If you are lucky enough to be invited by a member, they'll give you the grand tour. If you aren't, you can find the Castle Knight. It's no Hogwarts, but this magical castle of 20,000 square feet winds around parlours, bars, a restaurant and some medium and large sized rooms with a stage. I love how cozy it feels, lots of pictures, cartoons, photographs on the walls. Hollywood eclectic mixes with East Coast charm. Here's the breakdown- there are about 2 main shows, you have to be there on time or earlier to get in because only 20 people can watch per show. It's in the main parlour. If you're early or missed the show, no worries, there are plenty of magicians wandering around and stationed in bars and parlours doing intimate and non-structured magic tricks on and off all night. Certain parlours have a start time where you get in line and wait for the next show. Obviously, you buy drinks and that's how the castle makes their money. That's why there are magicians doing tricks right behind the bar, and waitresses are every where asking if you'd like a drink. Go ahead, don't be shy. I ordered some calamari and the waitress came in the little room in the middle of the show to serve me. Awesome. They'll sometimes throw in 'anyone want to order drinks?' in between tricks. Don't be fazed- magicians gotta earn their dough too.As I missed the main show, I saw alot of smaller ones with card tricks, coin tricks, and a medium sized show with a fifty people audience with some sexy juggling/pantomine and an old school magic show. ( pulling scarves, making things appear and disappear) I saw Doc Eason, who is one of the world's best magicians. He is witty and absolutely hilarious. I was literally 1 foot from him at the bar and I kept forgetting to look and see when he was slipping cards under his glass ( he kept getting the right card..under his drink) Probably the highlight of the night. If you dine, you get certain privileges, such as getting into a show earlier. A word on the dress code- you don't have to be ballroom fancy, but something elegant and simple will do. I saw a lady with a ballgown, gloves, and a shiny rhinestone purse, and I saw a lady with a purple skirt / suit. You don't have to go nuts, just don't show up in pants unless it's part of a cool girly suit. Pretty sandals are cool, definitely no flip flops. Guys...the whole suit goes, although I saw a dude with just a dress shirt. ( just one guy)  I'm probably going back there...this week.  ; )",5 star rating

2075,2/25/2011,"Wingardium Leviosa! Not Levios-O! Don't ask why I know this. Let's see...  What do I remember? Funny close up tricks. 2 stiff drinks that got the ladies a little rambunctious. 1 tasty entree of beef wellington. Amazing cheesy, garlic bread. Another one of my epic nights in LA. Such a good time. The last time I came here was in 2002 when I dated a magician who was a member. Not much has changed since then. It still has its old Hollywood charm, which is something to appreciate because much of old Hollywood is disappearing these days.Things to note: - If you have an invite, cover is $15 and dinner is required ($$$$) if you don't walk in with a member- Plan on staying 2 hours outside of your dinner service- Drinks are stiff and expensive, but at least it's not watered down- Catch as many as the close up acts as you can - these are more engaging and I even got a souvenir out of itThe only thing to keep in mind is just enjoy the night. Sure, you may come across some lame tricks you're going to criticize, but the experience of the Castle has always been fun for me. Explore the many rooms if you can. There are plenty of dark corners for an exciting/adventurous makeout session. Not that I have experienced that.

2076,9/9/2008,"The classic but quirky Magic Castle is a fun place to go if you can actually get an invite!  This historical landmark is somewhat on the ""exclusive"" side, only catering to members and guests of members.  Many of these members are actual magicians and magic industry folk!  I was lucky enough to be invited by a vendor our company does work with...so go figure!What you get at Magic Castle:1.  ""Victorian style dinner"" served under those cool metal covers (...""Dinner....is SERVED..."") - They gave me the choice of prime rib, chicken, or a veggie pasta, but check out the online menu - it's much more extensive.  I figured it might be the type of place with just average food (as you mostly go for the show), but my prime rib was moist and tender, and cooked perfectly.  They didn't skimp on the horse radish either!  Also, the chocolate souffle cake was delicious!2.  Magic Show by some of worlds greatest - FYI, the room is small and seats maybe 75 people or so.  You really get up close to the action, and btw, they take volunteers!  I tried to spot the birds up the sleeve, lady being cut in half, and disappearing cat but no game!  3.  To hang out at the castle - they've got multiple full bars, Haunted-Mansion style decor, Dark and velvet paneled rooms...this place is amazing, quirky, and makes for great photo opps.Overall, worth the trip through the neck of Hollywood.  Oh, and dress code is cocktail-style to dressy - I wore a black cocktail dress and my patent pumps and fit in just fine.  Guys must wear a suit.  Oddly, they will not let women have coats with zippers.  My mom had a long raincoat with a concealed zipper, and they made her check the thing.  But they let me in with my pea coat...",4 star rating

2081,2/11/2011,"My friends booked our reservation for last Saturday back in November. I guess this place tries to remain really ""exclusive"", so if you really want to go, become BFFs with a member so you can get invited!We arrived around 5:30 and got a brief introduction/card show before our 6:00 dinner. We were told beforehand that it's a minimum of $15 per person for dinner (not including drinks). So, you basically have to spend at least $40 to come here because it's $25 to get in. Nothing on the menu really appealed to us, so we opted for the cheapest choices haha. My boyfriend ordered the Roasted Half Chicken, and I ordered Deviled Eggs and Portobello Fries. The chicken was the cheapest entree (other than the vegetarian dish), and it was actually pretty decent and juicy. The portion was good enough for two people to share. The dish came with a rosemary lemon jus that was also pretty good, but just don't use too much otherwise it gets a little sour and overwhelming. The chicken entree also came with risotto and sauteed spinach. The spinach was alright, you can't really mess up this vegetable. The risotto, on the other hand, really fell short. It was undercooked and still hard. And according to the judges on Top Chef, risotto is supposed to be runny! Isn't that why Tre got elimated!? (Btw, Tre, you're still the winner of Top Chef in our hearts!) Haha but I digress..The Deviled Eggs came with caviar and a white truffle oil. I'm not sure what it was, but there was a strange and unpleasant odor coming from the eggs. Although they didn't necessarily taste bad, the smell itself was just really unappetizing, so we didn't finish these. The Portobello Fries were just okay.. too much batter in my opinion. They came out looking like chicken wings.I'd say the only good thing about dining at the Magic Castle is the bar near the restaurant area (there are several other bars as well). The bartender made my Henny & Coke pretty strong. Maybe he knew how much Asians love Hennessey? I don't know, but strong drinks are an A+ in my book. Thanks, guy! :)The magic shows were pretty cool. We saw a lot of card tricks and one main show with illusions, loud music, lasers, and whatnot. Overall, the magicians were entertaining and they try to include some comedy and audience participation into their tricks as well. I'd say 4 out of 5.I'm going to base this review mainly on the food, so it's probably a 3-3.5. If this was just a restaurant, I wouldn't come back or recommend it.Recommendation: Valet only, so bring cash. Eat before you come and try to spend as little as possible because the food isn't cheap, nor is it good. Save your money for drinks at the bar!",3 star rating
2082,3/9/2009,"The finale for my big birthday week...Sitting high atop a hill in the heart of Hollywood, Magic Castle is a world unto itself.  Mind you, it's not some big, flamboyant castle of medieval lore - it's more like a big converted house decorated with trellises and lights and other cute touches.  Yeah - the castle is CUTE more than GRAND.On the night of my shindig, there was a big event going on at the Castle.  Apparently, the entire downstairs was rented out to some bigwigs, with a lot of celebrities in attendance.  My friends spotted a couple, but as I'm celebrity-clueless, I didn't see anyone that I recognized.  Either way, valet filled up pretty quickly, so half of our group had to wait outside for nearly an hour as the rest of the group drove around looking for alternate parking spaces in Yamashiro and Hollywood/Highland plaza.Magic Mike, a truly awesome dude, totally hooked it up for me and 25ish of my greatest friends.  Eventually, we all got inside and with a giggly ""OPEN SESAME!"" we entered the hallowed halls of magic.  We had a blast during our private show (he and his friends are so freaking hilarious!), and despite the crowds, it was nice that we got a little tour of the castle itself.  It gave everyone a chance to see the castle in its entirety.After our private show, we broke off into smaller groups (this is not a good place to try to do everything as a large group) and explored various magic acts.  Of course, I couldn't be in 10 places at once, but the magicians I saw were funny, personable, and very old-school.  I personally LOVED the old-school vibe of some of the magicians (I felt like we went back in time), so that's where I parked my butt.  Others explored the larger shows and whatnot, and the boys were practically plastered by the bar.  The upstairs bar was DEFINITELY less crowded than the downstairs bar (which isn't saying much, as the place was so crowded it was practically a fire hazard), but the best place to be was.. outside.  There are many concurrent shows here and there throughout the joint, but the lines were long, and the hallways were crowded.  We were entertained by random people who were just standing in the halls, though, ready and eager to show us some of their magic.  Every corner, there's something to look at, something to do...Apparently, they charge a cake cutting fee here - so instead, we just did my cake outside on the benches (we're ghetto like that!  Haha!).  I didn't drink any alcohol, but I was told by the waitress that my Coke had free refills.  I doubt that the same rule applies for alcohol (you wish! haha!).  I've dined here before, and the food was just BLEH.  That's why we ended up having dinner elsewhere (which was equally BLEH).  There IS a mandatory dress code - which they are pretty anal about.  Some might find it stuffy, but I think it's great!  It just adds another touch of class to the whole World of Magic experience.  The boys all had to wear suits with ties (one friend took off his tie once he got inside and straight up got a TONGUE LASHING!), and the girls just had to look pretty.  We wore full on gowns, only because it was my birthday and I thought it would be fun to go all out, but hey - so long as it's a nice pantsuit or cocktail dress, I think girls will be fine.All in all, it was a wonderfully special way to celebrate my big 27th birthday.  Everyone had a blast (as most of them were Magic Castle virgins prior to this weekend), and we're already planning a repeat!Yay for Magic Castle!",4 star rating
2083,7/19/2013,"I'm torn between three and four stars.  The concept is unique and fun....like an adult Disneyland. You get wined and dined, you get magic, and everyone is dressed appropriately.  The entertainment is actually GOOD and you are in an exclusive fun environment.  You can enjoy it with family, with a date, or with friends.  The negatives are as follows:  The food is overpriced for what it is.  It could and likely should be better.  Its not expensive.  But it just doesn't fit the mold. The exclusivity is no longer what it once was.  I have been several times, and one time a group of 21 year olds were celebrating a birthday and well....young kids with new alcohol....had to interrupt two shows and cause a scene.  That is EXACTLY what people avoid by coming to a venue like this.  If we wanted drunk obnoxious 21 year olds, you drive two blocks down Hollywood and not up the Castle hill.  Lastly, and what made this a three star rating is service.  Before, the service was top notch.  Lately, its turned into upselling.  The waiter is not happy unless your table orders endless alcohol appetizers and deserts.  He actually will ignore you and tend to the more 'lucrative' table.  I know business is business, but the experience is not what it once was.",3 star rating
2084,8/27/2007,"definitely an experience and i'm glad i went.  the good:1.  it's different.  cheesy at first, but fun after the first drink.2.  close-up gallery: AWESOME.  worth the 45-min. wait in the cramped, stuffy hall with the ""warm-up"" magician that wasn't funny.  once you get in, it's very intimate and the guy was great.  some of the shit he pulled made my jaw drop, and i was 10 feet away.  sorry, can't remember his name.3.  my friend's filet mignon was pretty damn good, and the garlic green beans were very tasty, though overall everything was very very overpriced.the bad:1.  suit and tie for guys is required -- fine.  but don't have that dress code and not turn on the air conditioning.2.  don't tell me to show up at 5:30 and not have a show 'til 7pm.3.  don't charge me $30 for mediocre salmon with potato fingerlings that are dry and unseasoned.4.  don't have one bartender serving 50 people that have to wait around for an hour and a half.5.  the main stage show was BAD.  the first five minutes consisted of a large woman (that looked like a freakish, goth David Bowie) whipping umbrellas out of her flowing robe with gigantic sleeves, and making faces that read ""ooooooohhh, what'd you think of THAT umbrella?!""  and i SAW her take the bird out of her friggin' pocket later in the show.  i give her credit for getting up and performing, but it was all lighting and bad music; really not entertaining, especially compared to the close-up gallery.",3 star rating
2085,12/22/2011,"I write this review understanding fully well that The Castle is operating at limited capacity after a Fire closed the majority of its facility. That being said. Let me say. The Magic is Fantastic!! The food is like your worst Vegas buffet and then take it down a notch. No waiters or waitress, just busboys. No soft drinks included, No water at the table, bad banquet linen, chairs and table. Strange contrast to the fancy dress code requirements. In addition, no decent seating to eat and enjoy. Ever try eating at a two top cocktail table with four people? Does not work. Staff informs you at the buffet line that you can take your plate upstairs where there is additional seating. Now imagine carrying a plate of food 50 yards away up a flight of stairs to an area with just as bad seating. Its like the Food and Beverage Manager never worked in a functioning restaurant before. Look I get things are screwed up because of the fire, and that the coolest parts of the castle are not accessible, so at least make people happy and fill them full of food and drink. Not the case, Carving station very stingy. Cold food, watered down coffee. You enter the facility through the service entrance. The lighting in the dining room is painfully bright (No, im not a 70 year old). Here is some free advice. Your trying to keep it open and make $$ while the fire damage is being restored. Your NOT capable of serving a meal that properly represents your image. So dont do it. Sell people a few glasses of wine and some passed appetizers. Let them eat before they come. That way you all know what to expect. I have been to the magic castle last year at the same time. I gave it 5 stars. The magic saved this review form being negative stars. It was truly amazing. No problems there. Long story short, save your money. Come back when they have reopened everything and fired the Food and Beverage Manager. You will have a great time.",2 star rating
2086,8/1/2011,"What's all the hype about?  This place is old, outdated, cramped and overpriced.  Better hope you're never trapped in that place during a fire. The admission and brunch will set you back $70 bucks a head for mediocre magic and so-so food.  You're better off watching Copperfield reruns and ordering pizza.",2 star rating
2087,10/23/2012,"This place is unreal, if you are lucky enough to get a chance to go you HAVE to go.  There really is something magical about it.  The food is fine (maybe a little overpriced) but the overall experience puts this place over top.  Every time I have gone I've seen something that absolutely blew my mind.  There is nowhere else on earth where you can see so many world class magicians in such a unique and historical venue.",5 star rating
2088,1/8/2013,"Too bad my date was such a db because Magic Castle could have been a truly ""magical"" evening.  Removing said db from the equation, this place is awesome.  I was definitely impressed because supposedly you have to know somebody to get in.  The food was a solid B+, the drinks were strong but didn't knock me over, and the space is really cool.  The acts we saw the other night were really top notch, especially the guy in the big room who did the traditional magic show.  Very fun.  Hope the next guy who invites me here is a keeper.",4 star rating
2089,1/2/2013,"Once I learned to stop trying to figure out how the magician's did their tricks, I really got laid back and started enjoying the magic for what it is, artistry and skill and stage presence pulling off a memorable performance (that is, when it's really good!). The Magic Castle does not disappoint. I have rarely seen the same show twice as they have a great rotation of shows and performers. And I do enjoy playing dress up, and sitting in a lounge with an old time player piano and requesting songs to be played by an accommodating ghost.  I don't go there for the food because quality can be spotty, it's just part of the fun, and you need to make dinner reservations to secure a seat for the main show. Enjoyed Koppertop's show in the WC Field's bar, i really like that spot in the Castle. Look forward to my next visit...",4 star rating
2090,7/24/2014,"I was able to experience the Magic Castle through my friend who provided my hubby and I guest tickets. We were thrilled to experience since we knew being invited to such a prestige and elite location and one LA's gem was through invitation only. The moment you drive up, you see this beautiful manor sitting on top of this hill. You have you car taken by valet and then you wait in line. You need to wait until the rest of your party arrives before entering. Once your parting arriving, the host will explain the itinerary for you and the show times. You walk into the lobby, just your party. Pay your admission and they explain the rule, no picture below that point. Perplexed by how to get since never being there before, we inquired and were told to say open sesame to the owl on the bookshelf. And Tada! Bookshelf open. You walk in and it's amazing! The decorated reminded of 1800s old brothel house, a fancy nice of the old west. It was beautiful. I caught two mini shows  one with Nexus, he has great! Then we saw, mark Gibson, the kid was awesome, we chatted with him before the show, he was very cool and his magic was too cool! We missed the last mini show because the photographer blocked our passage through the hallway to get through while talking a picture and caused us to be late and the sitting was full. Wha wha. We caught the main show which was okay...I suppose I expected a little more piazza but I still enjoyed. We hung out with Irma a lot, the resident ghost piano player. She plays the piano if you ask her nicely and tip her, placing tips in her bird cage. We keep asking her all sorts of requests, Irma knows what's up. She knows the modern music. One of the guest asked her for some Daft Punk. The food was good, I keep hearing from yelpers that it sucks, I enjoyed. The drinks probably made them more enjoyable. All and all, my experience at the Magic Castle was amazing. I was glad I was able to enjoy with my friend to celebrate her bday and my hubby.",4 star rating
2091,7/9/2013,"I've been to the Magic Castle several times over the past few years and have always had a great time. Unfortunately, after my last experience, I will not be back. I have never been treated so rudely in my life, not only by the door man but by our waiter and the valet. I will, however, say that the hostesses were very polite and friendly. The door man was the worst. He had the audacity to ask my friend if he'd looked in a mirror before he left the house and called him a mess. (Keep in mind my friend had put his tie on in the car and hadn't had time to button his top button.) The smaller magic shows in the individual rooms seemed tired and unprofessional. Quite the opposite from my previous visits. The only good part of the night, which warrants the one star, was the main magic show which was fun and entertaining. Otherwise, it was a greatly disappointing night.",1 star rating
2092,10/13/2012,A must do in LA if you can! A unique experience and fun to do with friends.  Be sure to get in line early because seats can run out fast and carpool because valet is the only way to park.,5 star rating

2096,3/8/2009,"Although I had the displeasure of going to Magic Castle, I have never yelped this place. I was only reminded of it when my friends went last night and told me of the wonderful time they had. I went with two friends almost 1 year ago. I remember my chicken partially raw when I cut into it, so I returned it and happily agreed for a new plate. The same plate with my cut-into chicken came back overdone, so I just didn't touch the plate. Because my friends were so scared of ""making a scene"", I left the plate and still payed WAY TOO MUCH for it. I was livid, hungry and now being dragged to a magic show. I was excited for it up until his first act, I saw exactly where he was hiding his ball. Then in his next act, I saw this piece of paper he made ""appear"" which came from behind him on the stage. This perplexed me even more since I was starving and watching a  pathetic excuse for magic. I turned to my friends, quietly said good night, had a friend pick me up and I swore to never return. I read all these wonderful reviews about these amazing magicians.. what the hell?!? Why was I jipped? I have been to child birthday parties with magicians more appealing. But remember, I only was unfortunate enough to see one ""magician"", not all the others that may be fabulous.",1 star rating
2097,8/30/2014,"What a great historical site in Hollywood, I have lived in Los Angeles all my life and I barely found out about this gem last week! Haha - this place is great for groups or a date. I went as a group, I heard it's really exclusive to get in, I didn't ask anyone in the group who knew someone in the Academy and how we got in so I am going to keep it a mystery! Lol any ways. $30 cover charge... I thought $30 was for dinning ha I was wrong. Food is pricey so be prepared to spend. Drinks were water down, I order a 7 on 7 and was not great at all. The group felt the same way. The magic acts are really good! True professionals. The atmosphere is great, everyone is dressed formal which does not feel touristy - you may bump into celebs, I did, won't say who. Love the fact that you CAN NOT take pictures, so there isn't a lot of people doing selfies lol but some of the ladies in the group saw that in the ladies restroom so go figure. I don't know if I would come back but it's really great place to have fun and lose yourself.",3 star rating

2099,6/29/2007,"18 years I have lived in LA and for 18 years I have unknowingly missed this unique experience.""Open Sesame"" is more than a trite reference to magical history at the venerable lodge. Open Sesame actually DOES open the door from the ante-room to the bar. Open Sesame indeed!After a cocktail at the bar, all the while listening to the ghost on the piano, we adjourned to a small room/theater. In here, we watched a card master ply his trade. (Don't you think they should be called cardiologists?)From here it was back to the bar (see a theme developing?) for a quickie. The dining room was next. While the food was OK, it was quite expensive. I think, though, that people have to remember that they are attending ""dinner and a show"" and not merely dinner.  If there were no ""show"",this restaurant would not continue to exist with those prices.  I did have, however, the hottest(!) horseradish that I ever remember having. Good times.The main stage was next (after a stop at the bar). We saw 3 comics. The first was an 18 year girl who was a Little weak in the ""magic"" but magical with yo-yo's. She was actually unbelievable, working dueling yo-yo's. I googled her today and it seems as if she has been a champion since before she was even a teenager. As someone whose skill was shattered after Around-the-World, Walk the Dog and a few other minor tricks, I was in awe of her. The second dude was odd looking but did some great dove tricks. Those little, white bastards were flying everywhere. The only thing that would have made this show better was if one of the doves crapped on the audience.The final group was a male/female comedy/magic group who used a Peking duck as their white bird. The woman assistant was a huge hit in that she exaggerated the moves of a normal assistant, in turn making a parody of  her own profession. Excellent.After another drink and a bathroom break, it was time to leave. Overall, a fun experience. As I stood outside waiting for my car, it occurred to me that I felt about Magic Castle as I feel towards comedy clubs. While I love them and always promise to ""do it"" again soon, alas, I never do. Maybe this time will be different.",4 star rating
2100,11/22/2007,"when was the last time you dined with aspiring wizards, sorcerers, necromancers, enchanters - you know, magicians? and, to top it off, in a place v.similar to the winchester mystery house. that, in itself, is worth the trip. ...but i wouldn't go for the food. i'll come back to that.you have to be invited to thee infamous magic castle. you are checked in, and then to your left, say 'open sesame' into an owl statue that 'magically' moves a bookcase aside as the entrance to a magicians parlor. while admiring the piano that plays itself, i overheard the conversation of mingling magicians referencing the perils and stereotypes they must face day to day. ""...if someone hears you are a magician, they joke, 'watch out for your wallet', and thats sad.""we get a little buzzing, blinking pass that will buzz and blink when our table is ready; just like at the cheesecake factory, which is one of my least favorite places. i cringe at that, but it freed us to look at another bar upstairs. btw, there are bars everywhere in this joint. i couldn't help but hiccup the saying ""boozewahzee"" by the time the night was over.the table was nice. the service was niiiice, as in nice waiters and timely. but, as it may, i never got a drink i ordered and had to have it stricken from the final bill, and the food came out misadvertised. on to the food: bleh.old people cuisine. i doubt the menu has never changed. i had joked before i got there, ""what should i expect? jalepeno poppers and fries?"" a little bit upscale from that. fried artichokes. and a crab dip with tortilla chips. no one else liked the crab dip. said it tasted funny. i was hungry, so i ate it. i don't know if it was old, or if it was canned, or if it was from the s.f. bay oil slick crab scandel - i couldn't go to work for two days from horrible stomach pains.you might be thinking maybe it was the liquor. i assure you i am a professional in the drink department. have a great reputation being a good time gal, actually. :"") i had no hang over the next day, but was in the fetal position clutching my stomach.it could have also been the steak, which, my fault, ordered rare. i do this at good restaurants. thought at $39 for a steak with bland sides, it would be a healthy cow. the steak was tough. couldn't finish it. my friends prime rib was tasty though. if ever to go back, i would avoid the totally unseasoned asparagus, milton steak combo, and go for the vegetarian ravoli (not on the menu) or regular cut prime rib. it was the safest to leave the kitchen. i suggest to the kitchen, though, get fancy at those prices! seriously boring menu.",3 star rating

2104,3/27/2011,"My husband and I purchased the Open Sesame 30-day Membership. We are now considering purchasing the full membership. This place rocks!Here is some information that all first-time visitors will find useful. There are 3 theaters, plus a 4th theater that they began opening recently. The shows start at 7 pm, and run until 11 pm -12 am. Most theaters have 2 performers, an early performer and a late performer. Each week, the performers change. The busiest time is Fridays and Saturdays, between 8 pm and 11 pm. Below is breakdown by theater.Close-up Gallery. This is the smallest theater; it only sits 20 people. It is on the 1st level, to the left of the entrance. The early performances begin at 7 pm. There are usually at least 4 of those. The late performances begin at 10 pm. There are at least 4 of those as well. Each show is approximately 20 minutes long. I would recommend getting in line at least 45 minutes in advance to get in. Parlour of Prestidigitation. This is a larger theater that sits 56 people.  Up the stairs, through the dining hall, and all the way to the back.  There are 3 early shows starting at 7:30 pm, and 3 late performances starting at 10:30 pm. Each show is about 20 minutes in duration. Get in line 30 minutes or so before the show, and you should be able to get in.Palace of Mystery. This is the largest theater. Up the stairs, through the dining hall, first theater you encounter. The performances start at 8:30 pm. The show runs about 40 minutes, and usually has 2 to 3 different performers in it. Dinner guests reserved tickets for this theater, so it is difficult to get in unless you are having dinner (see more on dinner reservations below). Get in line at least 45 minutes prior, but be prepared that you may not get in anyway. The Peller Project. This is the 4th theater I mentioned above. We have never been, so I cannot provide much information. There are 3 shows beginning at 8:30 pm. Bar magic. There is also bar magic, meaning there are featured performers in 2 bars, WG Fields Bar (8-10pm), and Hat & Hare Lounge (9-12pm). Occasionally, there are other magicians at other bars and impromptu rooms.  Dinner Reservations. Make dinner reservations 6-8 weeks ahead for Saturdays, 4-5 weeks for Fridays, and about 2 weeks for brunches. Weekdays dinners are easier to reserve - 1 week prior is usually enough. Dress Code. They are serious about dress code for dinners, but the brunch ""smart casual"" is basically ""whatever wear"". The dress code is also more relaxed for women than for men.Drinks. They are very strong. If you like mojitos though, the bars tend to run out of mint early on. There are 5 bars as well as waiters combing lines for drink orders. Service. It varies. The front desk people were very nice every time we visited. The waiters tend to get snappy at the night progresses, but one can hardly take it personally. After all, they have been on their feet for hours in a packed place accosted with an unending string of questions not all of which are what you may call ""intelligent"". Overall, the quality of shows is very high. The performers are top notch. If you have a chance to visit, take it - you will not regret it.",5 star rating

Zabrecky transported us back in time, and was an amazing performer and magician. While DelGaudio handled cards like nothing you could imagine, seriously. It was a night of wonderment and amazement. It was almost as if we stepped back in time to an era where life still had mystery and there was no google. We met a lot of great magicians who were waiting to see the shows at the castle, they were incredibly friendly and had fun tricks. We sang with Irma the ghost piano for over an hour, (things like bohemian rhapsody, and Elton John) with a large group of friendly strangers. It exceeded mine and my husbands expectations, truly an evening I will never forget.",5 star rating

We had the herb half chicken and prime rib. The banana cream pie was delicious. I think most people go there for the experience verses the food. The drinks start out stiff but end up weak towards the end of the night. It's fun to explore all the rooms and see the history of the place. Towards the end of the night we ended up in the larger basement room with the bar where a younger magician was doing a show. That was my favorite show because it was a little more intimate and personal. Sadly we only caught the tail end of it. This is one of those LA 'must go to sometime in your life' places. If the drinks hadn't gotten weak I'd probably give it 4.5 stars. ;)",4 star rating

We had the ghost piano playing our requests from Elton John to Britney Spears. Loved just walking around and looking at the history. Only suggestion is take the early dinner and early show. It gives you more time to explore more of the castle that you get access to after the dinner. We had dinner at 8 and wish we had a few more hours to see everything. Dinner was great and our server was fantastic! Worth every penny.",5 star rating
2112,4/28/2009,"Where do I begin? Well, it's an exclusive club, so in order to get in, you need to know a magician or be a member. So if you get the chance to go, take it! It cost us $25 just to get in. The parking is valet. Which is pretty intimidating because most people who drive up own Mercedes and Audis and high roller cars. While I would roll up with my 1997 Honda Accord. Haha. You also have to dress up pretty nice. No sneakers and jeans here. On to the food. The food was less than magical. For what you pay to get in, and what you HAVE to pay per person, you'd think the food would be at least decent. You HAVE to spend at least $15 per person in order to get tickets to get into the main show. But at least it guarantees you tickets into the main show. But the food was horrible! We ordered mainly appetizers and sides because we didn't feel like spending over 25 bucks for a meal since we already spent $25 to get in. Let me start with the chili. Apparently the LA Times made this the number 1 chili in all of LA. Really now? My mom makes better chili than this! The sweet potato fries weren't too bad but they were definitely lacking in additional flavor. The ones from Trader Joes taste better than those. The onion rings were pretty good. They're HUGE! So that's a plus. The sirloin tips weren't bad. A little on the salty side, but at least it had some flavor. The mac n cheese was the only thing worth eating from all the sides we ordered. So if you're gonna opt for sides, try the mac n cheese. It was the somewhat redeeming factor to the food.I could have gotten better food at Sizzler's and saved about 15 dollars. But since this place isn't about the food, I'll talk about the show itself.The main show was actually pretty cool. I guess from what I hear from my friend that goes pretty often, it's sometimes a hit or miss with the magician. The magicians we saw in the main show were definitely entertaining. But I wasn't blown away. I wasn't amazed at how they could pull off such great tricks! But their jokes were pretty hilarious. So I give them that.The second show we saw was amazing. Not only was the magician entertaining, his tricks were awesome! He is Sweden's champion in magic or something like. And he was really, really good. He was charming and funny and his presentation of the tricks was done very well! I also love how he involved the whole audience as part of his comedic act!The other magicians that were sitting around the castle were really cool too. They had their share of jokes and definitely made me laugh. Their card tricks were definitely entertaining!Overall, it was definitely a fun experience. The magic made up for their less than decent food. And I'd definitely want to go back and give the main show another chance. Even if I have to eat their food.",4 star rating

2117,5/5/2008,"Maybe I never really grew up, but I really had a lot of fun here. I had the occasion to visit California one spring, and one of our activities was Magic Castle. Magic Castle is a magician's club and it's member's only. That means unless you know a member from whom you can get tickets, the doors to Magic Castle will be magically sealed and bolted from you.Like most exclusive venues, the dress code required a tie and jacket for the gentlemen and a dress for the ladies. Do I enjoy getting fancied up? Usually no, but Magic Castle was one of those instances where wearing a jacket and tie and accompanying a group dressed in their finest adds to a night of magic and mystery.As you can imagine, Magic Castle is housed in a very Victorian-esque mansion in Hollywood. The flora and fauna are meticulously groomed and the dark imposing castle looms over the grounds. Traffic to the castle was pretty bad. Plan on leaving early. Parking is valet and there's a $20 entrance fee.The theatrics begin as soon as you enter. Take a moment to take a picture. With a whisper of 'open sesame', the bookcase slides open to reveal a hidden set of stairs. Walking up the grand staircase, you'll find yourself in the main dining area. This is where the main magic happens.. as in the magical disappearing bills. Dinner is on the expensive side, more so considering it isn't all that great. The ribs and steaks were mediocre, I'm told. The fish of the day, orange roughy, was pretty ok. It had a mild taste, neither outstanding nor offending.On to the shows! You can get lost walking around the Castle at the first pass, but it's really easy to get your bearings. The dining area is crowded, but once in the outer areas, navigating is much easier. There are two or three stages dedicated to guest magicians. I guess you can call these the featured acts. They appear at various scheduled times, so be sure to get in line quick! I had fun at all of them. There were a couple duplicate acts, but even still, the showmanship of the magician made the whole experience. Heck, I still think the finger movement thing is hilarious and anybody could do it. In addition to these featured acts, there are bars throughout the Castle. The bars are hosted by card carrying magicians.. as in they do card tricks, really really impressive card tricks. There was one British fellow at the basement Hat and Hare pub who was really outstanding. He would string trick along trick along trick along.. well you get the picture. We'd all think.. there's no way.. that's not possible! On the middle floor there was a more Victorian bar with pew seating that had an impressive card magician as well.Perhaps I am easily impressed and / or, at times, just really childish, but I really really liked the Magic Castle. The tricks, the showmanship, the near impossibility of it, I was impressed by it all. Sometimes, letting yourself get lost in a bit of pleasant fiction is magical in itself.review 5/5/2008I.M.Y.",5 star rating

My only complaints:1.  It took about 20 minutes to get inside the building because valet was so backed up so leave earlier then planned if you have a dinner RSVP;2. The waiter took about 15-20 minutes to take our drink order so be prepared to order your drink and meal;3. Because we ate dinner there, we received tickets to the main show.  Our waiter came at 7 minutes before the hour and said he needed to get us to our next show and rushed us out.  We didn't order dessert and we were the last to enter the show so we had bad seats.",4 star rating

2127,12/24/2013,"First of all generally speaking there are two ways to get into the Magic Castle: Become a member or be invited by a member. With that said this place is pretty special, I have been one time and invited 7 friends to go with me. You first begin with a nice dinner followed by magic shows. The dress code is very strict, jacket and tie is strictly enforced. There are main shows and small side shows or close magic that you can see. I would recommend going on a Friday or Saturday night just because more then likely there will be a good selection of magicians as well as some possible famous people in the audience. This is some of the best magic shows and close up magic that I have seen before. I highly enjoyed taking my family and a few friends to this great exclusive event. If you can go to the Magic Castle I would highly recommend it. It is an ""experience"" that you will not forget and is not a common thing. Have a few drinks and come with an open imagination for an unforgettable night!",4 star rating

Plus, you get to dress up! Which I know isn't exactly a perk for all men. Be careful with the dinner! Steaks are pretty safe bet, but never, ever, order the vegetarian special.

2133,4/20/2011,"Kind of ""magical"" in that it only exists in Los Angeles (unlike Skid Row Staph Infection - which also only exists in Los Angeles but is not quite as magical).Sure it's cheesy - in the same way you might never date a magician or someone who bends balloons for a living (but damn that sure is one nifty giraffe).  The interior is dark, dank and full of knick knacks - paintings and furniture that only adds to the experience of being in Liberace's basement (sans the whips, chains and assorted rhinestone codpieces).The kitchen -  I certainly would not venture near it but this is Los Angeles - - if you're a local it's not likely you will know the difference (oh I'm sorry - am I bashing the inferior tastes and expectations of Los Angeles area locals again - yes - yes I am - and from the sincerest small crevice in my otherwise vacant black heart - I'm sorry...).You will need to know someone to score an invite - although if you ask around I am sure someone you know will have some level of a connection (if not forget about scoring a ticket to the Magic Castle - you should be considering a new circle of friends).It's not cheap - so plan on making a night of it.I usually go post dinner - arriving somewhere around 10PM.Men are encouraged to wear a jacket and tie.  Ladies (and I use the term loosely) tend to come a bit overdressed but what's the harm - I often enjoy seeing the latest in Loz Feliz prom formal attire...The Myth:  That you must eat dinner to see the show.  No - if you eat dinner you will get top priority in seating for the big show - otherwise go a half hour early - be first in line - then once they seat the people who ate - they will seat you.The Fact:  The big room shows typically suck.What you want to do is go downstairs to the bar - cozy up to something simple (Jack and Ginger or the like - don't drink the wine - again unless you've had dinner there - then it won't really matter as again you'll most likely love the boxed vintage)  and be amazed by the close up sleight of hand coin and card tricks.  This is where the action is and where you will have the most fun.Yes it's super cheesy.Yes it's overpriced.Yes - it's a good time with the right person(s) and/or attitude.And yes - you should go at least once.",4 star rating
2134,12/27/2008,"This place is so overrated, old and smelly. I celebrated my b-day here last night and had the worst time of my life. We arrived 3 hours before dinner reservation. Waited in line for 2 or 3 different shows only to be told our possibility of getting in was slim to zero. We were finally given show tickets after dinner but it does not start until 2 hours later ( 11:15pm ) . By then we have been so tired of waiting around we just decided to leave. No Magic shows no matter how good is worth 5 hours of waiting in line. We paid the $25 entrance fee and did not even get to attend any of the shows. Their ticket and waiting in line system is an epic fail!  I am sorely disappointed and will never return consider coming back here.",1 star rating
2135,6/27/2016,"Came for a birthday celebration.  Had to come during the day as we had kids with us and wanted them to enjoy the show.  I seemed a little rushed.  We came during the holidays.  We came to the early brunch.  You need to come on time as the next seating was in a few hours.  There was time to see all the shows but you had to go right away as if the rooms were filled, you would have to wait.  I guess it seemed rushed as they were having kids things in one of the rooms with raffles and santa.  If you stayed too long down there, you would miss some of the shows so you had to spread your time between the kids and the shows.  The shows were brief and entertaining.  The rooms were cozy so you could see everything.  We wanted to see everything because this was our first time and probably only time as you need to know a member to come.  I would like to go again sometime in the evening for the adults only to see the difference.  Very enjoyable but wished we had more time.  It was a little pricey as there was a fee for parking, entrance and buffet.  Worth going at least once your life.",4 star rating
2136,8/5/2011,"Interesting place. Definitely recommend going if you have never been there before. Get there early to avoid the very long wait at the door. We arrived at 5:30 and walked right in. Had a few drinks at the bar and watched a couple of magicians do some very cool card tricks.  Our dinner reservation wasn't until 9:45 (sigh) so we just wandered around and saw a few shows.  The only thing you can order at the bars are beverages, so if you have a late dinner reservation, definitely eat something before you go.There are quite a few bars throughout the castle and when you are standing in line they come up and take drink orders. They  really push  the drinks here, but they are not obnoxious about it. If you don't drink, that's fine too. I don't and did not feel uncomfortable at all.Everyone was very friendly, magic shows were great. A few obnoxious drunks here and there, but the staff takes care of that very quickly and quietly. Plan on spending about $100 a person. Parking $8.00 valet (no other options)Cover charge $25/person on the weekend. (the pass just gets you in the front door). You still have to pay the cover charge.Alcoholic drinks $10-15 depending on what you order.  Non alcoholic around $3.00Dinner Entree $20-$50. The cheapest entree is vegetarian (grilled vegetables).  I had the prime rib regular cut for $33.00. comes with mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked medley of fresh vegetables. It also came with a salad which must be a relatively new addition since it doesn't say that on the menu. Our server was wonderful. Professional, personable, and very experienced. We did not have to wait long for our food or the bill. Probably the best service I have had in a while. Food is good. A little over priced for what you get but then so is the food at most of these types of entertainment venues.Optional : Photo- $20. The photographer will take a photo and if you buy the 8x10 for $20 you also get a pass to come back again. The pass is good for up to 8 people.

2138,4/22/2010,"All I can say is once you leave this place, you will have a little more respect for people like Harry Potter  =DI have been to this place twice and it was a magical experience each time.  The first time I went there I was blown away.  I have been to other magic shows before, but sat far far away from the stage.  I'm talking parking lot far.  At the Magic Castle you are right there in front of the magician doing all the magic tricks.  It is a very different experience.  This place has a strict dress code policy.  Make sure to check the website so you are properly dressed for the night.  The staff are very friendly.  The inside of castle is decorated with pictures of other magicians and display cases of magic material to view.  There are magicians that does all sorts of magic ranging from card tricks, sleight of hand, mind reading, and many more.  Right after each main show, the magician performer will be outside so you can meet and thank them personally for the wonderful magic show.  There are magicians all over the place.  You could be sitting at the bar and there are magicians drinking right next to you.  There are magicians in auditoriums, in the bar area, or small rooms.  No matter where you are in this castle, there will be magic happening all around you.  Be prepared for drunk folks.  A lady tumbled down the stairs while I was there.  She was just tore up from the floor up.  I guess its all apart of the magical experience.You can do valet parking at the Castle or park at a local public parking lot and walk up to the Castle.  Dinner was great too.  American style type of food.  I ordered the New York steak strip and it was damn good.  It was served with asparagus and mashed potatoes.  It was a wonderful meal.  The fried portobello mushroom was also out of the world good.  The batter they used was perfect.  Also they have the best complementary bread.  It is making my mouth water as I think of the bread while writing this review.  Someone pass me a napkin, now! It is soft, moist, sweet, and warm.  It was served with generous about of butter, not needed.  By far the best bread I have ever tasted.  I can't believe its complementary.  Do not hesitate to go here if you are lucky enough to get an invite.  It is an exclusive club and only club members or guests of club members can get into the Magic Castle.  Highly recommend it to people who likes magic + good food.  The visits inspired me.  Going to work on the ""get my GF to listen to me"" magic trick now.  Abra Cadabra and B00M!  Bon Appetit!",5 star rating
2139,12/25/2010,"The Magic Castle is in a once in a lifetime experience... for many reasons.-DRINKS: Really good. My party and I grabbed some drinks before taking a tour of the place. They were strong but delicious, made with top-shelf liquor. At $12, they were slightly pricey.-FOOD: Pretty good. The mushroom fries were okay, just simple tempura. The garlic bread was heaven. I heard the prime rib was good, though not as good as Lawry's. The beef Wellington could have been better- it wasn't seasoned, and was fairly bland and overcooked. For dessert, the crème brulee was average for a fine dining establishment. The banana cream pie, however, was quite nice, especially the crust. Main entrees were extremely overpriced, though not the desserts or appetizers.-SHOWS: Good. The main theater offered an excellent show. There was a great illusionist who did tricks with birds. There was also a ventriloquist, and a very funny magician who did simple, old school tricks. The smaller theater shows didn't compare. One magician did tricks that were so simple, I can't see why everyone was amazed, except that...-ATMOSPHERE: Bad. Everyone was drunk. It was Sunday night, but the place was full of people completely wasted. They yelled and screamed during the shows that came after 9 pm. They cut lines, shoved and stepped on people, and actually interrupted the shows. Also, the dress code isn't as strict as it's made to appear. The other clientele was not dressed elegantly. No coats for the men, and ripped fishnets and day dresses for the women. The size of the crowds was manageable, and we walked into many shows without having to wait, even though they were supposedly busy. However, the people in the crowds were not manageable, so we left before the unruly bar crowd grew. In summary: Go, but only go once, unless you're part of the aforementioned crowd. I'm sure the Magic Castle used to be a classy cool place, but I think it's lost some of that glamor.",3 star rating

I ordered the beef wellington.. which again, was salty.. the lamb was the best dish that we had that night.. the steak was too tough for the price we were paying for it.. the one major downside is that the seats fill up quickly so you do have to wait.. limiting the number of shows you can watch.. all in all a very fun experience.. if you get the chance.. go",4 star rating

Not great because you can see the magician mess up one of his acts.  He was suppose to pop a girl out from his cape but while he was walking around u can see her feet under his cape, but he gets an A for effort.  Other than that, the magic was pretty incredible!There was this one drunk annoying lady right behind me that kept disrupting the magic show by yelling out stupid things during the show and i wanted to turn around and punch her.  It was very unclassy and annoying.  Apparently after the show i wasn't the only one who thought so either, but the magician played it cool and would throw funny comments back at her so it became entertaining after a while.I would come here again, just much earlier than dinner time.

2150,2/21/2012,"I took my wife here last night for her birthday.  I hadn't been here since I was 12 years old (31 now) and she had never been before.  This is a private club so I took some of the other Yelpers advice and e-mailed all of the magicians performing on the day of the show for guest passes and one of them e-mailed some to me.  We arrived early on Monday evening and were the first people let in right at 5pm.  With guest passes, we still had to pay $20/person cover charge as well as the mandatory $8 valet parking. We had a 6pm dinner reservation, so we had to kill an hour before we ate.  Based on other reviews, I somehow expected the place to be a little bigger with lots of various wings to explore, but I guess certain parts of the mansion were closed off due to it being a Monday night, so exploration options were limited to pretty much the main hallway that leads to the various performance rooms.  Prior to coming, I was informed about the TRICK BARSTOOL in the main bar when you enter (it's the second one from the left).   When you sit on the stool, it slowly sinks and the person doesn't realize it until they've almost sunken to the floor.  I had my wife sit here and it was pretty funny when she finally realized what was happening.  Drinks were pricey but strong (wife ordered a martini-style drink for $11).Dinner is mandatory and each person must order an entrée.  For appetizers, we got the cheese bread and fried calamari, both were OK.  For entrees we got the Penne Shrimp and Lemon Chicken.  Both were OK (shrimp was a little better).  Total bill including tax and tip with no booze came to $90 for the 2 apps and 2 entrees.  VERY expensive for the average quality, but I came into this knowing I'd be gouged on the food prices so it wasn't a surprise.Since it was a Monday, it wasn't nearly as crowded as I hear it gets on weekends so we got to see plenty of magic.  We saw 4 shows in the various rooms and also got to sit with a random magician at a random table in the dining area, which was great (we saw a total of 7 magicians).  The most enjoyable experience of the night was CLOSE-UP magic room.  It only sits about 30 people and is very intimate.  It was also really cool to sit with the magician at the random table just because it felt so unofficial.  As for the magicians, most were pretty good.  A couple magicians did some VERY cliché' tricks that anyone who's ever done basic magic knows, like the 2 brass ring trick, rope trick and the cups/balls trick.  I would have liked them to pick some tricks that were a little less generic.  We also had Irma the invisible piano player do some tunes, which was fun.  To summarize:PROS-Atmosphere.   The place has a very elegant old-world Victorian look.-Friendly staff.-Magicians were entertaining and did good tricks for the most part.-Close-Up magic room.-Random magicians sitting around the Mansion doing tricks when you approach them.-Irma, the invisible piano player that takes requests.  You'd be surprised how many songs ""she"" knows.CONS-Dinner policy and pricing.  I really didn't like the ""mandatory dinner and mandatory entrée"" policy for non-members.  What if I don't want to eat their average-quality food?  I'd much rather they just did a drink minimum like most comedy clubs do.  Food was way too expensive for the quality received.  -Some outdated and cliché tricks from some of the magicians.  Good for newbies who've never seen ANY magic before, but some of this stuff was magic 101.Overall, it was a GREAT time and I definitely plan on coming back at least once a year from now on.",4 star rating
2151,4/27/2012,"I have been to the Magic Castle twice now.  It is a really fun evening out.  Allot of people will say that the food is not very good - well screw them, the menu is just ""outdated"".  The food is what would have been called ""continental"" in the past.  Also, it's not the food that you come for.  Anyway, if you can get an invitation, then you should go unless you are the type of person that is allergic to fun.",4 star rating

Even the bartender knew magic tricks! Very cool place to celebrate a birthday!",5 star rating
2154,9/2/2012,"Wow. The employees were so rude to us. We went for a birthday party and had eleven people in our group. Had a late reservation so didn't have a lot of time to spare between the overpriced dinner they force you to buy and the last magic show of the night. When dinner was over we asked for separate checks and the waiter snarled at us and told us no. We're a group of eleven 20 somethings, did he really think we were one big family? We got the check and had to depend of everyone to do their math correctly. We only had about 5 minutes before the final show was about to start. When everyone had their shot at figuring how much they owed, we paid our bill and found out we were still $30 short. At this point it was about showtime. I had never been here before and was so excited to experience the whole thing so I was really frustrated and angry with the waiter for being difficult and extremely unhelpful. One of the people in our group decided to eat the $30 so that we could be on our way. We get to the doors of the theater and the employees are yelling at us to ""hurry up! Get in! The show is about to start!"". I replied ""tell that to our waiter"" to which the employee replied, ""that's right, it's never your fault, is it?"". WOW! How rude can you be?!The dinner itself was pretty meh. Over priced and average. The fact that they make you buy a dinner is so weird. If this was a place you could hang out, have a drink, and enjoy yourself then it would be a much cooler place. The magic acts were also average. Nothing I hadn't seen before. I also didn't know ventriloquism was considered magic.Overall, I had a pretty terrible experience between the employees, the stress, and the cruise ship entertainment. I wouldn't go back even if they invited me.Harsh review you say? That's how little fun I had that night. For $250, you'd think I would've had some fun.",1 star rating
2155,7/23/2010,"We were invited by a friend (thanks Cat!) who is friends with a member/magician - Randy. Randy was very affable and genuine, as was the rest of the magicians here, and he was kind enough to give us a small tour. I even got to meet and shake hands with the 2 founders of this place (1960s), one of them being the architect. Very cool.- Facility: From the outside entrance from valet parking area (8$), the place seems to be small. While scoping the place out during the tour, I began to realize that it was huge, with some rooms being smaller with more up & close shows and others have the more flashy and main epic shows. The entire place is like a historic venue, its been around since 1910, and redesigned for the magic purposes in 1960. And since then, it seems as if time stood still. All the bars, doors, walls, ceilings, etc have a story behind them on how they've acquired the materials & designs for them - ask a member to give you a tour if you really want to have an appreciation for the build of this place. There's 5 bars; one main bar at the front (the bartender here was the only employee of this entire establishment that we weren't too fond of), and the rest scattered everywhere. Plenty of drinks for the night to be had! Behind the main bar there's Irma, the ghost & owl who plays piano songs by request. She played most songs everyone requested, but didn't deliver on john legend =( but regardless, it was pretty cool.- Magic shows/tricks: I don't wanna be like the other reviewers of this place and get into detail about any of the tricks - that's for you to experience & find out, if you get the chance that is. I think half the fun of viewing a magic trick is not knowing what tricks to expect. All I gotta say is that even though I've never been a huge fanatic about magic & all, I was thoroughly entertained. Before dinner we watched a funny& charming magician from Venezuela, now residing in Spain, perform some nifty card tricks. Our main show after dinner was a guy who used to perform in Vegas (Jones?). I found myself quite engaged with each magician's tricks and their personality & flavor they added. My favorite in particular was the final magician. He was much younger than most the others and performed in something like more than 1000+ shows. His tricks were cool, but what got me was his confident swagger & edgy humor/attitude. Kinda reminded me of Stifler from American Pie. I wouldn't have minded if he just did stand up comedy with no magic tricks at all actually.- Dinner: The 9 of us were given our own separate room & sat at a round table. The room also has a back story and is a tribute to Houdini, which has actual real stuff of his on display. The gf & I shared the prime beef which I thought was eh, but the Portobello fries & lobster mac & cheese I thought was quite delicious. I also got a black & coke - for all this it came out to be 68$ before tax & tip. Overall I'd rate the dinner meal a 7/10, but the setting of the room and everything was top notch.All in all, this place is very awesome & fun and welllll worth a visit. If the opportunity comes to give this place a visit, do it!!*No pictures allowed in the entire place. They have professional photographers who you can pay to have an 8x10 developed at the end (20$), which comes with a free guest pass.**You really do have to get dressed up, almost to the max - one notch short of wearing a tux for guys. I didn't see a single male without a suit jacket & tie.***Wait 30-40 minutes prior to the start of any show you wanna see to get front row seating - it's worth it. You have guaranteed seating for the main magic show event if you eat dinner here.",5 star rating

Expect to pay $100-150 per person for the night. What disappointed me the most was the night we went was some sort of ""youth week"" and there was no warning about this. We were not told in advance. And these were literally teenagers who had been practicing maybe 5 years tops. And as much as they tried, they weren't very good. There were a lot of mistakes all night and a lot of starting over and dropping things. And certainly no ""magic."" For $150 I wanted to see REAL magicians and impressive work. For this ""youth week"" there should have been major discounts or dinner should not have been required. At the least, we should have been told so we could have made our reservations for a different night. What a disappointment.",1 star rating
2158,12/3/2012,"The absolute worst experience I have ever had!!!! Came here for my bachelorette party and was told I can not order the  lobster mac & cheese unless I'm ordering an entree- which was a weird requirement and did not appeal to me, the menu was awful and needs to be updated desperately. I ordered the lamb just so I could see the show with my bridal party (show wad equally as disappointing as the food, none of us were even able to sit next to eachother). I ordered it med - came out rare just like every other table that I noticed around me. Chef seems to think he knows what's best, and same with the rest of the staff. My bridesmaid and I were speaking (not yelling) in OUR room that we paid too much for, we were interrupted by an adjoining​ room by pounding on the door at 11pm on a Saturday to keep it down. What a disappointing bachelorette party, I feel bad that my bridesmaids had to pay for such a terrible experience. Now they are planning an amazing party in Santa Barbara, where customer service actually matters to them. I received an extremely rude and unapologetic response from the restaurant manager stating ""he doesn't even know who I am"" and they are not responsible for the rooms. EVERYTHING about this was terrible, and I don't know who he is either!

2159,4/7/2012,This is one of my favorite places in the world. I've always had a good meal but haven't eaten there recently. The quality of the magic does vary a bit.  Always good but a real treat on those nights where it is outstanding.  Performers change each week.  Friday and Saturday nights are very busy and can make it hard to see all the shows. I prefer to go during the week when I can.  I love magic so I am a bit biased but my friends that have gone either with me or on a pass always have a good time.,5 star rating
2160,1/20/2015,"I have been to The Magic Castle several times but had not been in about 5 years. Well we went last night and it certainly not the same. Although the food is quite good it is severely overpriced $175 for 2 people. The entrance fee was $20 per person plus a $13 valet fee. we also had 2 drinks and 2 cokes totaling $36. The Castle was so crowded that all we got to see was one show and we waited in line for 3 others but were told they were full. They had one magician doing tricks in the basement but we only saw about 2 minutes of his show. It seems that the Magic Castle has turned into a money making machine and doesn't really care about the quality of what they are turning out or the quality of the guest experience. As for this being an exclusive club, the magicians were handing out guest passes like they were water. Its very sad to see this happening to a once great club. If you are into overcrowded spaces and drinks and not seeing more than one  show, then this is the place for you.",2 star rating
2161,9/17/2013,"MAGICAL!!!     I've been to this place twice now. Second time around I knew that is worth your while to get there a few hours before your dinner reservations. Otherwise you will not have enough time to check out all the magic shows happening in different rooms.  Not going to get too detailed as I don't want to spoil your experience. Just know that there are tons of bars through out the place. You have to check out the piano area.  GO TO EACH room if you can as all the magic shows are jaw dropping. Food is delish too I'm very pleased with their prime rib. The service is excellent throughout the whole establishment. Not only are the magicians entertaining you'll get some of the drunk guests who think they've figured out the trick & make a fool out of themselves...so funny.   I've been told that there are other ways to be able to make a reservation. However, the only way I know is to get invited by someone affiliated with the castle. Then when you have dinner with them someone will come to ask you if you'd like to take a photo.  Just purchase the photo as it comes with an invitation good for 6 people to return. That way you don't have to wait to get invited by someone again.",5 star rating

Suit and tie for the gentlemen and cocktail dresses for the ladies. I enjoyed dressing up for the evening. Multiple theaters and impromptu demonstrations throughout the castle make for a great evening. You'll see masters showcasing their specialties, magicians fine tuning their acts for the road, and others just practicing and furthering their mastery of the craft.

2168,1/14/2007,"Eclectic, off-beat; nothing in the world like it.  Sometimes great, sometimes not so much.  Some folks get it, and some don't.  The nice thing is, those that don't, don't come back.  (Apparently, they go and review Target stores.)  And good riddance.L.A. is known for ripping down old palaces, and I've been watching it happen for more than thirty years.  From Tiny's, Schwab's and Ship's, to Ciro's, Perino's, and the Coconut Grove - shabby to chic, anything that's got history ends up with a target on it.  Sure stuff gets saved - but would you feel better if they killed off most of your family just because they let some of 'em live?  Save it.Unlike most of the old timers in town who need fund-raisers and low benchmarks to keep the doors open, the Magic Castle has never become cheap and easy, though it's going on forty-five years as the most famous and successful private magician's club in the world. You've got to know someone to get in, either as the personal guest of a member or by getting an invitation from one.  But let's assume you don't hob-knob with illusionists, card sharps or Shimshi, who might bring you in as their guest.   An invitiation will get you and up to seven of your best friends in, for a cover charge of twenty bucks each.  Buying dinner is part of the deal, and that'll run you thirty to fifty each, depending on your taste in beverages and desserts. The food is great (despite what fussy mouths say) but if you're looking for a spectacular, fine dining experience, you're already missing the point of the Castle, so skip it.    Enjoying an evening at the Magic Castle means being able to appreciate the incredible, dimly lit, Victorian-esque labyrinth itself as much as taking in the entertainment.   The Castle features a minimum of six or seven different entertainers seven nights a week, with additional, unscheduled performers appearing from time to time throughout it's many chambers. And the lineup changes every week of the year.  You'll have to step lively to catch all of the week's performers in one night.  Avoid the busy crowd of Fridays and Saturdays if you can, but if that's when you have to go, Do It.  Ask to be shown to the W.C. Fields bar, for some of the most amazing close-up fun you'll ever have.    Five bars and quick, winsome servers will keep you plied with beverages throughout your visit, though, yeah - the booze is overpriced.  (But if you're just looking to drink, try the Bigfoot Lodge. Seriously, Carol and her crew pour 'em stiff over there...  mmm.  Right, then, I'm off.)So if you can wrangle an invite, use it.  Like I said, nothing lasts forever, especially in this town.

2176,11/24/2010,"this is a tough call for me because i'm rating two things here.i give 5 stars to the magicians and the atmosphere of the magic castle experience.the magicalness starts from the moment you walk in and have to say 'open sesame' in order to get from the lobby to anywhere. from there your journey begins. depending on the time you get there, you may be seated for your meal, which we were and i'll discuss later. but the entire dinner we were super excited talking about previous magic shows we'd seen or getting amped up to what we were going to see. once we got into the shows, they blew my mind. it was really awesome and i really want to go to a comedy/magic show sometime again in the future. in between every show, there's other stuff you can do there.you have to check out the magical piano. the piano is so freaking awesome. it can play 97% of songs out there. my personal favorite was 'baby got back' by sir mixalot. hahahai give 1 star to the food and dining experience. the food was pretty average for ""fine dining"". it was pricey, but the food left me kinda eh. not still hungry, but unsatisfied. it's kind of an awkward combination when one thing is so awesome and a second thing is underwhelming. it's like when you watch heroes season one and it was one of the most perfect seasons of television and then you watch season two. it's just.....awkward and you don't have the best taste in your mouth after it's all done. like the steak at magic castle:\",3 star rating
2177,5/24/2011,"Apparently this is a pretty exclusive place and the only way to get in is by invitation only OR if you're a member.You walk in and are greeted by two hostesses' who are pretty nice.  This is the line of defense you have to get through if you think you may be out of dress code OR the last line of defense if you're trying to get out of the Castle with your glass of wine and let me tell you, they are good, so just come in dress code and drink inside.  I didn't read the dress code so I didn't have a suit jacket, they provided one thou, Velvet, sweet.So to get in you have to say the secret password in order to make the bookshelf slide open and allow you entrance into the MAGIC CASTLE, magic!The place is really nice, decorations are awesome and there are a lot of little somewhat 'hidden' corridors that lead to other rooms, really cool.  Everyone is dressed up, suits and dresses, even a cape or two.  Bar area is classic, drinks are expensive but in a place like this you have to expect that, they're strong though.  It can get a little crowded so don't expect to start waltzing in the center of the room.  Oh one thing that is pretty cool is the Ghost Pianist Irma, she takes request for songs to play and acknowledges you when you say thank you, very cool.The people: Mixed crowd for sure, well when it comes to AGE group it's mixed, that's about it.  Everyone kinda keeps to their own group for the most part.  There are some people there with a wealth of knowledge about the Magic Castle, there is a lot of history here, and they have no problem sharing it with you.Dinner: Dinner was ok, I wasn't blown away.  I had the rotisserie chicken; it wasn't like it was bad it was just ok.  Dinner was pretty pricy, and I don't mind that because like the drinks, in a place like this it's expected, but the thing that was annoying was that you HAD to purchase a main dish, HAVE to purchase a main dish?  How many girls don't order main dishes because they don't want to eat that much? Personally I wasn't that hungry because I ate earlier.  Eh, that just rubbed me wrong.The Show:  We only went to one show, Parlour of Prestidigitation.  The show was comprised of one female performer and one gentleman.  The female performer opened the show, now as nice as this lady was, the show was super corny, corny to the 3rd power, CORNY.  The music, her magic tricks, were talkin' a floating ball that traveled up, down and around, to and fro, high and low and some of those magic rings, the ones you click together, as well as magically appearing umbrellas, ugh.  Very spiritual in her performance, which isn't bad, but she had these funny 'dramatic' looks she would shoot at the audience, lets add 'saucy' to describe those looks, put a shake weight in her hand and you have a commercial.  The guy was hilarious, Farrell Dillon!  Comedic magician and very active with the crowd, he even told these drunk girls talking in the back to shut their mouths, in a funny way of course.  Good show so definitely look for him, he only had a small performance, which was lame but still enough to redeem the show.  He had a thimble bit, very good, you could probably look him up.All in all it was a pretty interesting experience.  I don't know if I would ever go back, but it was cool to experience a place like that once.  Oh, there is valet, and probably the easiest thing to do in the way of parking, only $8 but you pay it forward so make sure you're on that guest list otherwise you just paid to have your car driven in a circle Cheers!",3 star rating
2178,2/4/2010,"i could go on for paragraphs about the amazing decor -- the victorian mansion was converted in the '60s and every inch of wall-space decked out with Magic & Magician collectables, every time i go i notice more stuff i hadn't noticed the last time i was there, all of it awesome! i'm kind of sad that i see they've just changed their menu, i'm not sure why people always complain about the food here, but just like when at Canter's you shouldn't order the enchiladas, but get what they specialize in (i.e. Jewish deli food, like the pastrami...), when at an old-timey steakhouse you should order the surf n turf (which was delicious and cooked to perfection) instead of going for one of the menu's attempts to foray into more ""modern"" or ""healthy"" options... and they better still make the chocolate martini!!",5 star rating

2180,1/9/2011,"I had such a blast here! I came here for a company holiday party and the owner is a lifetime member so our group lucked out! Parking is valet, and just like everyone else's previous reviews said, you have to say the password ""open sesame"" at the door to get in through the sliding bookcase door. The decor has an old fashioned victorian/hollywood/saloon feel to it. Very interesting and a lot of different paintings & drawings to admire. The entire place is like one big maze. There's magicians stationed at different areas at card tables... kind of like at a casino and there's crowds gathered around them. I noticed that wherever there was a bar, there was a magician stationed close by. One bar had a magician in the middle of the bar! We had a private room upstairs in the dining hall and the waiters listed the dinner options to us so no menus which I thought was very nice and personable. The bread they bring out at first is this really tasty flaky bun. The garlic bread they brought out shortly after wards though was A-freakin-MAZING!! It was cheesy, garlicky, warm & soft. I savored each bite I took & even after dinner when they took it away I was sad but couldn't possibly fit another one in my stomach. For dinner I chose to eat the salmon with artichoke hearts and risotto. Yum! & for dessert I ordered the chocolate souffle. I was surprised that they had souffle and listed it right at dessert time. Usually they mention that at the beginning because a traditional souffle takes about 30 minutes to prepare since it's so delicate. No wonder because it wasn't like other souffle's I've had before... The entire cake was soft (it was flour less) but it didn't have that oozing middle that I love. It was delicious and my overstuffed tummy managed to fit that.. along with the some red velvet cake and cheesecake. hehe! What can I say, I can be completely stuffed but once I see sweets my mind wills my stomach to find the room. :) Dinner was fabulous; I had a couple glasses of Riesling, water, & coffee. We were advised to head to our showroom 30 minutes prior to the start time to make sure to get good seating since it's first come first serve. Luckily, the theater we went to was smaller (meant for about 30-35 people with seats and others had to stand). Our group had 25 or so - so it was perfect for us. We saw The Peller Project show with David Hughes and Rob Zabrecky. Their act was hilarious and so entertaining! I sat in the front so I had the pleasure of participating in one of their acts. SO GOOD!! I wish the show could have went on longer in fact. They have more smaller magic side shows that go on until 1AM I think. We went back to the bar and then stopped by another side show downstairs in the basement before we left. I had such a magical time! :) There are no pictures allowed after the lobby, and it's a very tiny lobby so you can basically get a picture in front of the open sesame bookcase door at the beginning. They also don't let you use your cell phones, which is fine because if you have ATT&T like me, you won't get any reception whatsoever. Valet is $8. I can't tell you about the pricing since all our expenses were paid for by our company YES! but I'm assuming it's on the pricier side. Anyway, I had a fantastic time, so despite the price; if you ever have the opportunity to come to The World Famous Magic Castle, DO COME!",5 star rating

Although it borders on being quite cheesy, and reminds me of the Haunted House at Disneyland.The shows themselves are entertaining, pretty decent magicians.The show rooms are interesting - some small, a couple larger ones.The food was surprisingly very good.  Much better than I had anticipated:  The beef wellington was excellent as well as the crab cakes.  The wine selection is decent as well.Service was great, our waiter made a nice birthday surprise for my boyfriend.The meal in total for us, with a bottle of Pinot, appetizer and main came to about $140.Drinks throughout the night that we had were mainly Crown and 7 and that came to $11 for each drink.The only REAL negative, is that CERTAIN other guests there, especially if they are members or have been there before, feel a sense of entitlement to do whatever they want.  At the last show, the night was ruined by a group of douchebags who felt they were privileged enough to unhook the velvet ropes that mark off the waiting line and subsequently bring in 6 more of their friends ahead of everyone else waiting in line.  And then the leader of this tool pack had the audacity to say to me: ""lemme guess, first time at the castle?"" because, APPARENTLY, if it's not your first time at the castle, it gives you the right to be a jerk.",3 star rating

2190,6/16/2009,"Truly Magical Place! The shows here are amazing, you can't find a better place in the world for Magic shows that you can experience in an up close environment. I have visited the castle for many years and still think it is one of the best places to be in LA, but not the cheapest. The food is not too bad, well it's actually pretty good but not worth the price by on its own you're paying for the experience of being at the castle. As a guest to the castle you are required to pay for dinner so, I would recommend the lamb.  I would also recommend going during the week to avoid the crowds. Weekend the shows are the same as the shows during the week except for the morning brunch on Saturdays. Saturday brunch is the only time kids are permitted in the castle and the only casual day which is a ton of fun for kids and adults. Say ""hi"" to Norma for me (she will play any song you ask.).",5 star rating
2191,1/23/2011,It's quite incredible how awesome the magicians are in this place. They are world class. Better than the magicians in vegas. But this place is hard to get in since you must get invited and you have to dress up in formal wear. I was here one night and got lost alone in the building and it got creepy since it was really late and no one was around. Very old style house. Very cool vibe. It has a self-playing piano in the main bar area. There are a ton of nooks and crannies to hang out in. I think I saw 4 or 5 magic shows that night and there are more to see than that.,5 star rating

2193,8/26/2007,"I took my boyfriend here for his birthday. In order to get in to the castle, we stayed at the hotel (the only way one gains admission without being a member or scoring a guest pass from a member). Since we were not members, we had to have dinner here as part of the event. The food is not good...at all. I had seafood linguini & my boyfriend had chicken marsala. Both were around $25, and both tasted very generic.The atmosphere is really cool. Trap doors, a ghost that plays the piano, and a selection of magic shows to view. Also, there are 4 or 5 bars within the house so that you can get good & liquored up; the best way to enjoy magic. The Magic Castle is a great place to go for a very original date or with a group of friends. It combines childhood excitement with a sophisticated evening, but be prepared to spend a lot of money!! Charging a $20 door fee and forcing visitors to eat an overpriced/tasteless dinner is why I knocked off  a star. Otherwise, I love this place!",4 star rating

2199,3/25/2013,"My single star is for the food in the main restaurant.  I had planned on ordering an appetizer and a small salad, but our waiter informed us that we were REQUIRED to order one entree per person, which start at $24 and go up to $42+.  Now in a facility that requires formal dress and charges this much for entrees, I expected the food to be decent.  I ordered the Penne Pasta with Chicken, described as cooked with ""Vodka cream, pancetta and fresh basil"".  When I received the entree, it was barely warm.  The pasta was fairly chewy and clearly had not been cooked to order.  The chicken was cut into tiny cubes and there were only 4 dice - sized cubes in the whole dish.  It was completely bland, cooked with a generic tomato sauce; no vodka cream, pancetta or fresh basil whatsoever.  It tasted like something that would be served at a cheap buffet restaurant!  As presented, I doubt it cost them more than $1 to create this entree which they charge $24 for.  It was obviously cooked much earlier in the day in bulk and kept warm in serving trays somewhere.  The garlic cheese bread appetizer, in complete contrast, was fresh, hot and delicious.  The waiter did take my dish away and the manager took it off the bill which I appreciate because it was unacceptable.  In this formal environment and for those prices, they should be serving food that is up to par and respects their customers.The magic shows were entertaining:  The magicians ranged from good to outright amazing.  The magic shows made up for the shortcomings in the dining room.  I certainly hope they improve their food in the restaurant, especially since they require each guest to order an entree!",1 star rating

Before heading out here, make sure to check the website for times of the magic shows, so you can plan your night accordingly and not miss any of them...don't also forget to fully explore the joint, check out the basement areas, and visit the ""unique"" piano lounge by the entrance. If your interpersonal skills are also up to par that night, try chatting up any of the gentlemen lounging around, since many of them are aspiring/practicing magicians and would happily show off their much-practiced skills to you in a private show if asked nicely. There are also photographers who walk around the valet parking/dining room areas: STOP THEM.

And to get your bow-tie-wearing drink on. Aside from the portrait of Doug ""There's Always Room For Beauty In the World of Magic"" Henning, one of my favorite things about the Castle is the bar, because after a few drinks the evening become much more fun. Tip: getting into the Castle the first time is the hardest, but once you do, hang out in the cellar area, watch some close-up magic, then ask for some guest cards when they're done.

2204,9/17/2011,"A truly magical evening!!! I was blown away by the talent here. I ate before heading to the Magic Castle so no dinner was had. I first went to the Hat & Hare pub on the lower level where Magic Mike Jacobson was performing. He was AMAZING!!! Very witty and charismatic...one of the smoothest magicians I've seen up close and personal. The pub was an intimate setting so you really feel like you're a part of the magic. Since we didn't have dinner reservations, we didn't have tickets to any of the show so we waited. Our first stop was the Parlour of Prestidigitation. Luckily we got in after a 30 minute wait. We saw a mentalist who I forget the name of but he was very good. I've seen some of the tricks that he performed but I felt that the audience participants were truly amazed, hence so was I. I wish I had been picked to be a part of the act because that would've been awesome. For the last show we weaseled our way into, we waited over an hour...it was at the Close-Up Gallery and it was TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT!!! We saw Johnny Ace Palmer who I think is a phenom! I was totally flabbergasted by his magic!! He literally made my jaw drop by how fantastic his magic was. I was staring at his hands the whole time and could not see how he was making objects appear out of nowhere! He had the whole auditorium (about 20 people) on our feet and cheering. We even yelled for an encore not knowing he was already gone and out of the auditorium. I absolutely love Johnny Ace Palmer! The Magic Castle itself is an old hotel/saloon that has so much character. It reminds me of a murder mystery theater where there are doors disguised on walls and bookcases and the entire evening started perfectly by having to say ""open sesame"" so that a bookcase slides open and allows you to enter the place. The dress code is fancy...ladies in dresses and guys in suits so everything has a very classy feel to it.

The drinks are great and take a trip to listen to Erma the Ghost on the piano and remember to tip the birdy. I've been to the Magic Castle dozens of times and I always have a memorable time. Always!",5 star rating
2211,9/27/2010,"Perfect entertainment for anyone, especially ADD people, with nonstop magic performances of all kinds including close up with a small audience, big stage with props and one-on-one tricks.  The longest show is 45 minutes which is the big stage performance at 10pm, and most of the other performances are no longer than 20 minutes.  The castle is an amazing venue with many interesting rooms and features to explore and it is highly recommended that you find a Castle Knight (employee/guide) who can point these out, tell you about its history (which is actually interesting) and walk you through.  Close Up Gallery: Intimate magic show with a small audienceThis is a great way to start and end the evening  as it is a a small venue that limits its audience to 25 people.   Being so close to the performance just increases the wow factor when you are able to see every detail of their tricks.  Also, the magicians always incorporate humor and stories, making it all the more entertaining (and even more entertaining if you are enjoying cocktails).Palace of Mystery: Big Stage PerformanceThis usually involves 1-2 magicians doing tricks with elaborate props.  The magicians really engage the audience and kept the energy up throughout the show by being funny, entertaining and shocking all at once. Magic in the Salon: Best place for one-on-one magicThis is the best place to hang around and have a drink surrounded by tons of magicians, a lot of them being willing to do some one-on-one magic.  For me, this was the most fun part of the night as some of the tricks I saw were much better versions of anything I had seen on David Blaine and were truly mind-blowing (a lot of ""think of a card"" type tricks and making that card appear in the craziest of places).Dinner: Quite good given that food is not its core businessAs a guest you are required to eat dinner at the restaurant.  I recommend the steak, but probably best to stay away from the tuna tartar (clearly wasn't fresh as the tuna was fairly gray when it was served to us).",5 star rating
2212,10/9/2010,"If the walls could talk here...   But the bad economy made these magicians talk and share more tricks up close with ""real fans""; therefore, their acts are even better than the club's golden days.  Loved the blend of young and old... Hollywood is so about celebrating  youth, and here, even the older performers from the 1960's are treated like ""superstars"".  Love it!  The members who walk around can tell you really cool stories about their past careers in the magic business and beyond.  Especially, telling are the women, as there just aren't that many.  And any may even give you a future guest pass without getting a pricey photo taken.  You can NOT take photos inside, but in the lobby and outside.  The entrance management team will take great photos of you!   Seen many performers go from here to Las Vegas and beyond.  You get a time schedule of the various acts, and you can plan your route along the evening.  Don't get too trashed, as you really do look like an idiot if you say stupid stuff in front of great one on one performances. Can I repeat, if you can't hold your liquor, don't, just don't do it, save it for your days hanging out in front of the trailer!  The acts are pretty short, so you don't get board, if you are hyper like me. If you forget your jacket or tie, no fear, you will get to choose from a few stylish ones!  A basket of ties will be given to you, and you will even get help with the matchy matchy of the whole thing! The only reason for the missing star is the pricey ticket of even a guest pass.... It came to about $125 including drinks per person for the evening with tip, dinner, and whatnot.  But from 7pm to 1am, you can really have a good time with Irma the magically inclined invisible piano player.  Trixie the tragically encapsulated ticket taker by the downstair bar.  And the many stops along the way with mini videos from the past.  There is a gift store where you can take home $5 playing card packs.  We saw Jullian Penn on Friday night who was taking in a few shows or two.  Wow!  Was he tall and holding court about his upcoming tv appearance and renewals.  You can't help but listen if you are a pleeb.   And a couple of famous perfomers that I recall seeing when I was small, but couldn't remember their names.  I will say that my husband got a playing card thrown by a performer and autographed by him.  The funny thing was that his super slick JC Penny's suit with an 80's skinny tie made him look powerful enough to resemble a Hollywood power broker as the performer was curious enough to ask if he was.  Good taste on my part!  Love the on-going renovations, and it seems like a great haven for magicians to connect and build their presence in the entertainment industry.  Left most of the wacky fun... the safe that opens to what I think is the spooky underbelly of the building.  A bit dated carpet, but that can be updated easily, like the dinner menu and chairs have.  And the veggie option is ok.  But for the meaty eaters, you will be especially happy.  Great with friends. and loved being with the friends we were with as we looked and were cool!  Don't forget to ask any performer walking by to perhaps show you their skills. I thought they would be a bit stand offish from the past, but a young Japanese fellow Tigre going back to Japan next Monday gave us 3 amazing close-up card tricks in the hallway. We joked that he was performing ""Super Magic"".  It was!   Really!",4 star rating

Freshly prepared breakfast items - potatoes, sausage, scrambled eggs, extra light waffles (would come here just for that), smoked salmon, veggies, live carving station and desserts.

Saw Ruby Coby in the Palace Room, very enjoyable.  Saw Mike Kent in the basement room (its a very small, intimate room) and he was great.   For Dinner wife had strip steak, which was overcooked and the potatoes were bland.  I had chicken, which was really good (but wife said it was just okay, but she was probably bitter over his not good steak).  Had red velvet cake for dessert: not good.  But really its about the entertainment and ambiance and that is excellent.  Definitely give it a shot (although, still confused about how to get on the guest list)",4 star rating
2216,6/8/2011,"I was here last Friday night for a friends birthday. I honestly had no idea what to expect and I was certainly a little skeptical. I mean c'mon, Magic? How cheesy was it going to be! Well, to my surprise it was awesome. Dinner was a little pricey but the food was delicious. The shows were hilarious, the magicians were young and the tricks were fun and pretty original. I laughed my ass off for hours. Also, you can walk all over the castle with no pressure to go to any shows. The only downfall is that in the end, it's expensive. 25 bucks a head to get in, dinner is about 50 if you're drinking, and then drinks are about 10-12 each. If you're lucky though, a magician just might have cocktails magically appear for you!",5 star rating
2217,12/3/2009,"First time to the Magic Castle.The bar was a bit dingey and in general the decor feels tired and cheesy.  Not the classy place I had expected.The Maitre d' was overwhelmed with the 8 p.m. seating and we had to wait, standing for over 20 minutes.  The table we were assigned had been set for over 10 minutes before.  The servers missed cutlery for several of us, but gave one place setting 4 forks.There was an a-lister celebrity in the crowd, so maybe that set them all a twitter.  I'll be good and not mention who, as everyone was actually really kewl about it.The salad course was something you'd get at a Hilton Hotel conference.The main course was EXCEEDNIGLY late, over an hour of waiting.  I had beef wellington, which was cold, the pastry soggy and the vegetables flavorless.  The potatoe side dish was good, but cold like everything else.  A fellow diner had to ask for sauce for the beef wellington as his was drier than Arizona.The other meals were also cold and unappetizing.  The food was so late that two of our dinners were hurrying to get their last bites down so we could make the show.The server when pouring my wine spilled a small drop on my shirtsleeve.  To their credit, they knew our experience was less than enjoyable and discounted our meal by 25%.  But honestly, I'd rather have had a good experience and been delighted by service, hospitality and a good meal, than the compensation of a discounted invoice.The magic show was phenenomenal.  The crowd mostly single men in their 30s, with two remarkable transsexuals (male to female.)It was definitely a night I will NEVER forget, but not for the reasons we went there.",2 star rating

Yeah I'm snobby like that just because it's one place I can impress my dates before! This L.A. historical landmark was very close in shutting down, and replace for condos. Condos?! I would sign petitions, or yell at my Governor if this ever happens. The dinner is so, so if your looking for a great tasting prime rib, it would be magical if they can do that. Unfortunately magic can't help it but their service makes up for it. The magic shows are the best, and the entertainers loves to involve the audience in their acts.

2238,1/16/2009,"Last night, my first time.... I was invited along with my husband, by my inlaws who were special guests of The Magic Castles legendary magician John Calvert. We had the pleasure of watching his performance, then meet and great with him afterwards. He's 97 years old and still performs with agility and finess. For his 100th birthday, he is invited to perform at the Palladium in London. The magic was fun to watch. I've never been much of a fan of magic. I like it but it's not something I've always strived to watch. So this was indeed a treat.The magician we saw in the smaller room was equally entertaining. Phil Van Tee did his entire performance silent but it was just as effective. A graduate of Ringling Bros & Barnum and Bailey Clown College was quick with his fingers, kept me mezmerized and amazed me with each trick.I loved the interior designs of each room and how they reflected the art of many magicians who have entertained us throughout their magical careers.My husband and I were the first to arrive so we waited in ""Irma's"" mystery room. She wasn't in yet when we got there, but we had the pleasure of seeing her play later on in the evening. The food I must admit was not all that great. I had the chicken marsala which in my opinion was kind of bland and dry. My chicken marsala is 10 times better. The pasta that came with it was also bland, loaded with garlic and no zest.My husband had the filet. It looked pathetic sitting on that huge plate. It came with a tiny silver cup of au jus but my husband said it overpowered the flavor of the meat. I found it it to be slightly dry with no buttery taste, a filet should melt in your mouth.The lobster tail that my inlaws had was way over-spiced, it kind of killed the mild flavor of the lobster meat.For dessert I had the creme brulee. Now I know it's supposed to have the ""torched"" layer of sugar on top, but this was just burnt. I had to take that layer off to enjoy the creaminess underneath.My husband had the white chocolate bread pudding. I didn't like the texture or the flavor. My husband's bread pudding is much more satisfying and more flavorful.  Maybe they have the better chef working on the weekends? I sure hope they have a top chef. All in all I'd say it was a good visit and I will look forward to another return on a weekend night for sure.",5 star rating

It was a little difficult to know where to go.  You have to just kind of mill about and find shows and a line forms for dinner that you wouldn't know unless you asked.  The magic shows are good but kind of what you expect.  A lot of card tricks and the comedy got a couple of laughs but wasn't hilarious.  The black couple on the main stage with the doves and rabbits were pretty good.  The valet was horrible (took long and didnt open our doors) but was less than expected at $8.  Not something I will do again any time soon but glad I got to go.  Oh and they also dont allow zippered jackets for women which I thought was lame and selectively enforced.",3 star rating

It's never a bad night at the castle! Most of the people I have met there randomly are so friendly and interesting to talk to, the bars have great drinks, and the shows are never disappointing. Only negative thing I could think of, occasionally you'll bump into a member or guest there with a stank-ass ""better than thou"" attitude, which kind of kills it. It once took a lot out of me to refrain from taking off my high heel and smacking some dumb broad upside the head!

Six of us had to pay the $20 entrance fee and a dinner reservation was required. Apparently when she called for dinner reservations in mid-December, there were very limited options and the soonest 8pm dinner reservation on a Sunday-Wednesday night was Jan 2. Which was pretty amazing because you would have thought the place would be sold out on Founder's Day.The dinner was OK, the restaurant's ambiance was very nice but the quality of the food was only mediocre.  We had a wonderful evening. The magic performances here will just take your breath away, it's so much fun to watch. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the galleries, so I'd recommend the ones with shortest lines so you don't spend your whole evening waiting in line.",4 star rating
2253,9/21/2011,"If you have the opportunity to go here, you should DEFINITELY check it out!  It's fun to dress up, but yes, it does get pricey.  The food is expensive, but good.  I had the salmon which was fine, but my husband's steak was better.  The side of spinach was fantastic.  It's really fun to wander around the castle.  We've been there twice and both times saw magicians that definitely wowed us.  This last time the main show wasn't quite as good, but we stayed for the last show in the (I think) Hat and Hare Lounge where Tony ""the cardfather"" Picasso performed.  He's a bit creepy but his card tricks are insane.",5 star rating
2254,5/10/2007,"This place is more of an experience than a restaurant. The food is pricey and nothing you can't find at a good American restaurant. Although I must say they had a wonderful creme brulee. The joy of going to the Magic Castle resides in the fact that you must obtain a guest pass from a member and you enter via saying ""Open sesame"" to an owl on a bookcase. I find it enjoyable to go to a place where they still enforce a dress code forcing you into fun evening wear in a world that has gone slummy. Upon entrance you will find different rooms for different magic shows which you can watch as well as wandering magician members practicing their close up parlour tricks with you. A fun place to go for you magic lovers.",4 star rating

I have been fortunate enough to go several times and it is a little escape from reality. And shockingly enough, fewer people than I imagined know of it. If you can, it is a sweet date place always bringing home smiles. Do get there early if you go on the weekends as the place generally becomes super packed. And on a last note, it's really hard to go wrong with a castle. Especially a magical one.",5 star rating
2257,6/30/2010,"MAGIC CASTLE. This place sells itself. It's Magic, the piano plays songs you ask it to, the dress code is a fantastic thing, it adds class to the place. I've never had a bad time nor seen a bad show. The place has a mystic to it that Magic exist. Just walking around and looking at the decor is fun. Drinks not so bad, a great time.

2259,12/4/2010,"This place is fun for a novelty evening. We started with dinner and I was actually very impressed. I'm used to event-style places having terrible food (just think of Medieval Times). Great field greens salad, fresh salmon, tasty risotto and asparagus, chocolate souffle and ice cream. Delicious! We were there for a work party so we had free drink tickets. I stuck with Chardonnay. The service was really good. The magic shows were kind of corny, but fun. I'd say the best part of the night was the up-close card tricks with the magicians in the lobby area. That stuff will blow your mind. Word of warning: Don't go here unless you are planning to get very intoxicated (or, I guess, if you enjoy being around intoxicated people). It's like a grown-up fraternity party.",3 star rating

2266,12/31/2010,"open sesame! seriously. you need to tell the owl at the bookcase to open sesame in order to gain ingress to the goodies contained within the magic castle. once inside, you can hang out with irma, the ghost at the player piano, who will play pretty much any tune you call out to her. i say almost cuz she drew a blank with pink floyd's wish you were here, but knew everything else i tossed out--walkin' after midnight, rhinestone cowboy, ring of fire, lucille, suspicious minds, can you spare a dime?--and she got them all within a second or two delay. pretty cool! no idea how they do that...the shows, while definitely cheesy, were totally fun. i mean, who doesn't want to see a pretty girl neatly disassembled and then reconfigured correctly? of course, lots of the requisite ripping of paper, cards, etc. only to have them be as pristine at the end as when they started, lots of deft moves with balls and scarves. a mind reading show where the guy actually called up one of my dining companions, so i know it wasn't a plant. dinner was actually pretty damn good too! i was really NOT expecting anything much, seeing as how the whole thing is so gimmicky (plus i'm vegan and was anticipating nothing more than a plate of veggies), but honestly, my party was happily shocked. we ordered the tempura portobello mushroom french fries with a ponzu sauce, deviled eggs with truffle something or other, prime rib, lobster mac and cheese, roasted lamb, and the kitchen made me a lovely bowl of pasta with stewed tomatoes, mushrooms and eggplant (this was v. nice, since the only veggie option on the menu had dairy, so they kind of just threw something together for me). the portobello fries and my past0a were great, and the rest of my party concurred that their dishes were outstanding. the best deviled eggs i've ever had, stated the one and only incomparable ms. kim.could have done with some turn down on the volume with the christmas carolers assaulting the dining public, but overall, this was a totally fun, totally tasty experience!",5 star rating

2277,6/22/2009,"Let me get this right out of the way so you all know what you are dealing with here. I have been obsessed/enamored with the World Famous Magic Castle since I first heard of it on a TV magic special as a little girl in Nova Scotia. I never in a million years thought I would ever be able to go. I moved to LA to marry the man of my dreams and have no interest in being an actor or musician or any of that. MY Los Angeles dream was to go to the Magic Castle and be singled out to take part in a trick...AND IT HAPPENED! OMG!! Ok, so here's what happened. Through the wonder of the internet I met up with a friend I knew in high school back in Canada. He is here with his wonderful darling wife making his way in this crazy city. After finding out I LOVE the Magic Castle he goes home, checks some things and VOILA we are there but a week later. OMG again.I spend the days leading up to it freaking out over what to wear(settled on vintage black velvet elbow length gloves and pincurls in my hair), what to do, how to NOT hyperventilate when I go in. The day comes and as we drive up the steep curved driveway I squeal like a little kid. This is WAY better than Christmas! It's all turrets, placards and mood lighting. We meet the rest of our party, introductions all around and head in.First stop: coat check. FINALLY! I dont know if the rest of LA has heard of this but a coat check is a safe place for someone to store their coat while enjoying your place of business. Its pretty rad, you guys should look into it.(not you Melisse, you have it DOWN). We are also shown a sign that says no pics. boo, but it's OK! (hint, cell phones have no flash and the bathrooms have cool lighting)next up, heading in.you gotta know the password.I'm not telling you. *wink*The building itself is AWESOME. Replete with paintings with eyes that moves,dark wood carved everything, stairs that seem to lead to a different place everytime you go up them, a thousand little rooms to discover so many things.We had dinner which gave us tix to the big show. Totally worth it. The food was good, the servings are gigantic! and I have it on good authority the horseradish will make your 'face feel haunted'. The wine prices were not over the top and comes in bottles. heck yeah. We were a party of 7 and had our own little room. Love that.They don't call it the Magic Castle for nothing..there are people doing magic all over the place. On the main floor there are a few ticketed shows. you cant possibly make them all in one evening so dont even bother trying. it will only thwart your bigger plan which is to just soak up the atmosphere and prevent you from finding what may possibly be the coolest cowboy card trick guy ever, that you CAN shuffle cards with gloves on(me!), and sometimes it doesnt matter how close you are to it, a slight of hand will amaze you like a 3yr old all over again.We also saw Scott Baio, which has nothing to do with anything other than mbooth loves chachi too.SoDress up, my minions, a girl in a Sunday dress looked woefully out of place. Bring on the billionaires diamonds, the formal gowns and the tuxedos cuz I wanna head to the Magic Castle again.",5 star rating
2278,2/3/2010,The steak I had here was literally the best steak I have ever had. I highly recommend!The entertainment is best on a weeknight: same acts as the weekend without the crowd. Would not recommend brunch unless you have young children (the acts are geared down).,5 star rating

Our waiter was fantastic, he was doing all sorts of tricks while he was serving the dinner. If you watch closely you will see. If your not paying attention to the waiter you will miss a show meant for you. he did all sorts of cool glove tricks, it was awesome. There was some mingling and then off to the show, our tickets got us up close to the stage, and there were several performers, each had a different style, but really amazing. I was not at all disappointed. The food was good, not spectacular for the price you pay.

Girls must wear cocktail dresses or dress up and guys must wear sports jackets and a tie, no jeans allowed. Sometime they will loan the guy a jacket and tie if necessary.

No cameras, which sucked - they held mine at the front desk after I got in a couple of pic's, but I'd imagine that they wouldn't want anyone flashing during the magic shows, which I can understand. So, the magic shows - yes, you have to wait in line, but with a cocktail in hand and good company anything is fun. There's a magician who entertained us during our wait and he was great.  We made it into one of the small room shows (only fit 20 people, but they have a couple so you can make one before dinner if you pay attention to the times) and it was amazing. I may be a sucker for magic, but OMG - I've never been so amazed in my life. Then, we went to the larger magic room and watched a magic/entertainment show that was great. The magic was again, very good - but a more vegas-y feel. Dinner was great - I recommend the mac & cheese. I got the ribeye - cooked exactly how I wanted it (rare) and it tasted great. I tasted my mom's prime rib - YUM. My sister got the chicken - a little dry, but seasoned well. I thought the service was great. The whole place has such a buzz about it (and so did I) that I don't even remember how long everything took - we were enjoying our food, family, cocktails and conversations.  We were there for the whole experience, and didn't focus on the minor details.  The magic in the small rooms was flat out amazing. I must have said, NO WAY"" & you've got to be kidding me""! 50 times. It was unreal. I sat in the front row and got to help assist on a magic trick. I have NO idea how the guy made 2 coins appear under my hand, but he did - and I don't care to know the trick - I love the ""magic"" of it all. I thought I was on an acid trip.  This experience will go down as one of the best nights of my life. Maybe I was just lucky & got the perfect combo of great magicians, waiters and food, but I will recommend this place to everyone I know.  Don't go for the magic, don't go for the food, go for the experience of it all.  You can't pick it apart - it's old Hollywood, outstanding entertainment and a night to remember.",5 star rating
2305,8/30/2011,"Went there for a girls weekend celebration recently and stayed at on the property assigned as condos/apartments.  Newly renovated and let me tell you it was awesome. This was like staying in a fulling furnished condo, decorated with a chic young edge.  Full kitchen, bath, living room and bath.  The fluffy white beds were a dream to sleep in and plenty of closet space for clothes and storage.  We had booked two units and they kindly connected them so there was plenty of room for us 4 gals, turned into more like a tri-level floor plan.  They serve a continental breakfast, which is more than the usual you get a most hotels.  The service was wonderful, just a quick call and they were they with whatever you needed, also nice pool on site and sitting area to lounge around ~picture Melrose Place environment.  Just walking distance from Hollywood and Roosevelt Hotel and like I said Magic Castle was on the same property and the wonderful Yamashiro restaurant on the hill. We cannot wait to come back again and visit. Oh, and they also have gated sub terrainean secure garage parking.  Actually if you stay in that close proximity you don't even need a car!",5 star rating
2306,8/26/2012,"Magical place for a night out!  The Magic Castle is terrific for a special night out...the castle itself is a labyrinth of mystery! I've gone on week nights when it's relatively quiet and on weekends when the place is hopping. You must purchase dinner, which is pricey, but food very good. Magicians vary from fair to excellent; you never know. I do dislike that sometimes it is really hard to get into more than one show...you have to wait in line. BUT: there's a lot going on in the hallways and neat things to see, so it's still fun even if you only get into a couple of the theatre shows. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars just because I kinda wish one didn't HAVE to have dinner there. You could see more shows if you weren't forced to dine. It's a great place; particularly impressive to out of town friends!  Plan to spend at least $60-70pp for dinner and one beverage; bar drinks $10 and up.",4 star rating
2307,4/28/2009,"Got fleeced last weekend at the Magic Castle -- high cover price, watered-down drinks for $13 a pop, lots of line-standing, some rude staff and a few tired, depressing magicians. Saw one decent magician, a guy in the basement who was funny, and another psychic who was pretty good, but overall it DEFINITELY wasn't worth the trouble or the money. Too bad. Creepy too that they obviously have hidden cameras and microphones everywhere -- wonder what they do in the Ladies' room? Boo.",1 star rating

2309,1/30/2008,"The Magic Castle is a unique experience. There are few places like it and it has an incredible history. Usually admittence to the castle is only through invite by a member or a performer, unless you are attending a private function at the castle. If you are lucky enough to be invited, do not pass up the opportunity to go. So what exactly *is* the castle you ask? Imagine the most incredible mystery house you can conjure up in your mind...red velvet, shelves of old books, creaking stairways, secret passages....got it? Well, the Castle is actually much more amazing. The real attraction at the Castle are the performers themselves. Each week new magicians from all over the world are invited to the Castle to perform. It's quite an honor within the realm of magic to be invited. If you're the type who claims ""oh, magic isn't for me"", I guarantee the Castle will change your mind. The Castle has three main show areas, the close-up room, the parlour and the stage. The close-up room and the parlour both showcase two seperate performers each night while the main stage showcases a bigger 1 hour show. So you can see up to 5 different performances in an evening (plus bar magic). Inbetween shows guests are welcome to freely roam the castle which houses TONS of magic memorabilia and a few surprises. In the basement you'll find both a bar (where they perform yet more magic) and a small museum where you'll find oddities like the trick billiard table used by W.C. Fields in his Vaudeville act. You'll also find the dungeon area of the Castle where you're likely to find more magicians to entertain you, another bar, and yes, more curiosities. I was at the Castle for 6 hours and we didn't manage to see it all (Tip: Be sure to step inside the phone booth at the castle). There are actually a total of 5 bars within the castle as well as a full restaurant. Wine and mixed drinks run about $8.00 each. If you plan to eat dinner at the Castle be sure to call ahead for reservations. Try to get the earlier dinner seating so you have plenty of time to see all the shows. Entrees run about $30 each. Their lamb is noteworthy. While the food is good, it falls a bit short for a place as amazing as the Castle but service was EXCELLENT. One last note, you never know who you might see at the Castle. On any given night you might find yourself rubbing shoulders with Hollywood and Magic royalty. Come prepared to be amazed, the Castle is truly an unforgettable experience.",5 star rating
2310,6/29/2010,"My wife and i bought passes at a fundraiser recently for $200.  I decided to go when my dad and nephew were visiting us on summer break.  When we made the reservation i was informed that we could only attend the brunch shows because my nephew was only 13.  I was also informed that the brunch would cost $35 per person.  After it was all said and done we paid almost $400 dollars for 4 of us.  The show sucked.  It might be good for children under age 6.  I was fighting to stay awake during the magicians performance. It was the worst magic show i have ever seen!!   Also the other guests were rude and pushy, jockeying for position to get closer to the front of the line for each mini show that was offered. We saw the main show, 30 min.  and could not get in to any of the mini shows because it was too crowded. The brunch was delicious, and the waiters were nice, but it was like fighting off barbarians trying to go through the brunch line.   save your money, its a rip-off!!",1 star rating
2311,3/11/2012,"We were lucky to be invited by a magician and the cover charge was waived. He even gave us a tour of the castle along with interesting trivia. It's victorian, has many different rooms to explore and filled with history. Along the walls of the staircase there's posters of magicians from around the world. Downstairs they even have an antique machine that Walt Disney donated to the castle (apparently he's into magic too) and random magicians doing tricks thoughout the castle. We went on a Tuesday evening and saw NPH (he's president) at the bar! Way cool! and then a guy from Entourage. There are several bars throughout. Drinks are pricey and small. You have to make sure to time your dinner early enough so that you can make it to the main shows because they get packed. We only had time for the main show and it was very entertaining. The 2nd time my husband went he said the show was kinda boring, so make sure to check the performers before.Food was pricey but better than expected, since I had low expectations from the reviews. I had the ribs which was yummy and fell apart w/my fork. Not the best but good. It was fun dressing up. We wore cocktail dresses and men in suits. A few older women wore slacks/sweaters and some came in long prom dresses- which I would not recommend since the bathroom is old and stalls were tiny. Overall it was a very fun experience!",5 star rating
2312,6/18/2012,"It's all in the magic. Got a guest pass and had a very enjoyable evening. Entry fee $25. Valet parking $8. Had to have dinner. The cheese bread is a cardiac arrest waiting to happen. Normal American fare, nothing truly special. Side salad was a bit wilty, the fish special, yellowtail, was a bit overcooked for my taste, but the wasabi mash potatoes were excellent, lots of spice. The steak was tender with a tasty bernaise sauce. Try and find some magicians that just sit around practicing their art. Be sure to request the show you desire after you have dinner. The peller theather is much smaller, so it is better if you have passes for that one instead of the other theaters which hold more guest. Guimaraes and DelGaudio were the highlight, even though we waited 1.5 hours for the last show of the evening, they were the highlight of the whole night. Just mind blowing greatness. The whole evening is so much fun. If you get a chance, go.",4 star rating

I had the Salmon with Parmesan risotto and we pretty much ordered one of each appetizer cause we did not want to miss out! Our food came out super fast, at first we were disappointed our waiter forgot about our alcoholic drinks but he then came back with an apology and comped them! =) Soon after dinner, like super soon, we went to watch the main show with had 3 magicians...super funny and entertaining!

Doug ( castle Knight who assist the Castle to answer questions as give out details of long time magicians)  met us at the main lobby bar and explained the recent  renovation due to the fire late in 2011. As I look around you see magician doing cards tricks and making all of us laugh , Erma the talking piano will answer most questions with a song , pay close attention who is around you as they can be  the performers for your magical evening. Meet, greet,a cocktail and off to dinner. Our party of ten, we had the table chattering , rain ? presidential debates, who will vote to increase taxes? was the buzz. Shrimp cocktail to crab cakes and deviled eggs with cheese bread started out culinary adventure. Our group likes to come 3-4 times a year So the Salmon was ordered and another fish (special) Penni pasta and prime rib also the beef wellington (my favorite).My wife ordered her favorite, the rack of lamb, always excellent! Looking around All looked good and this night we had a new guest with his gorgeous wife , she had the Salmon and he had the Penni pasta it was late in the dish and I noticed the shrimp in the pasta was bay shrimp(very small), had I noticed i would of sent it back the shrimp cocktails were larger. one of our guest that ordered the fish (special) found some bones, so watch yourself . chocolate cake, creme brulee, tiramisu and 10 spoons we all swapped and tasted .Given our  first seating tickets and paying the bill we were off to the main theater. We were laughing so hard from the first performance it brought tears to our eyes. Bill the bird , oh  that poor bird......  we traveled tonight as far away as Germany with a great magician and the Host with the white tiger kept us laughing . Off to the second show and a cocktail on the way took us to the basement and another great performance , I promise next time to have a 100 dollar bill. Both performers kept us in smiles and laughter , next time I want to tie the knots in  that string tighter. For us our third show will be the last for the evening , this great illusionist would move the coins right in front of you , I think we had our eyes on the pretty assistant , the closing card trick we talked about on the way home .All and all , a great magical  evening but Some of the food was not up to par.",4 star rating

The magic shows were fun, lots of different shows going on simultaneously to keep you moving through the castle. The whole evening had an 80s feel to it- maybe it was the decor of the building, the magicians funny Andy Warhol style ties, or the Michael Jackson tribute during the Rudy Cody experiment? p.s the mini MJ show was the highlight of the evening for me.

Try not to do it too much because the poor bartender has to put up with people doing it for hours on end.) The magicians are nothing short of amazing and you can even get a celebrity sighting or two in (if you care about that sort of thing).  Some friends of mine from work had a membership which is exciting because the only way you can get in is by invitation from a member.  The food is good.  Pricey, but you don't have to eat there if you don't want to. The website makes it sound obligatory but it is really not.  Men must wear a jacket.  Show up early to stand in line for the shows on the weekend.  The parlours are small and space is limited.  They have a Houdini seance room where for some extra money you can watch a re-creation of a parlour room seance from the turn of the 20th Century.  So much to do, so much to see.  Definitely going back again!",4 star rating
2327,3/23/2010,"What can I say bad about the magic castle?  Nothing.  My girlfriend and I took two of our recently engaged friends visiting town to the castle for a special night out.  Not having been there, we were not prepared for what to expect outside of reading Yelp reviews, but the night was definitely magical.  The club is tucked into a hill, only 3 blocks behind Hollywood Blvd. on Franklin...Very easy to find.  It's important to remember the strict dress code--several people in front of us either did not wear a coat or tie or both and luckily the castle had some extras to help them out.  Anyway, after paying the $20 cover per person, you enter the castle through a fake bookcase that slides away when you say ""Open Sesame"" to the gold Owl in the case.  The Castle features 3 different showrooms and several bars (I counted a minimum 4) that constantly have something to offer.  The drinks are stiff...which is awesome.  The best part of the night for me was Irma, the ghost that plays the piano in first floor lounge.  ""She"" responds to requests for just about any song, including playing a few notes for just saying her name.  She can play nearly anything...we tried to stump her with a few random tunes, including the Ghostbusters theme.  She played them all.  Another party even came in and requested Lady Gaga while we were in the lounge and Irma belted out ""Poker Face"" without delay.  It's pretty amazing.  The shows themselves are standard magic fare, but all tricks appeared to have been done masterfully, as one could not detect any errors in execution of tricks.  All in all, for a magical night, the Magic Castle is a great place to get together for a decent dinner and fun entertainment and socialization.  Would go again in a heartbeat.",5 star rating
2328,2/27/2011,"I was craving for sushi and asked my friends to come join me.  One of them suggests to me to go to the Magic Castle at the behest of his magician friend instead.  I was dressed in casual clothes ready to go out for a night out on the town.  ""No, no, no"", says my friend.  I would have to dress classy tonight.  Dress shirt, tie, slacks, dress shoes atypical of my student clothing.  I asked if some other friends could join us and he asked how many.   The reason I found out was that the Magic Castle was pretty exclusive; either you pay a ridiculous sum(to most people) or you have the pleasure of being friends with a current member or magician.  We get to the place and right away, I notice the grandeur of the castle.  It was an old style building with stone fountains.  I remember waiting in line for the cashier and just looking around.  The decor definitely matched what I imagined in a castle.  Faux stone walls and all.  Oh, and the infamous owl.  Say ""open sesame"" pleasantly to the owl and the faux hidden passageway will open for you.  I'm pretty sure there's a guy on camera watching you, as I doubt the place is magical enough to have a recognition of a multitude of distinct voices preset.  Once you get on the inside, you are not allowed to have photography, so I will describe the gist of what I remember with the best of my abilities.  Everything is old style, carpeted floors and wood walls.  People holding drinks everywhere, which I have heard are really strong.  Although we were handed a schedule, we explored at our own leisure.  There were not that many rooms used the day I went.  Magicians rotated in and out of the same rooms.  Most of the magicians seemed to deal in card tricks with a few of them making objects disappear or doing mind reading.  Again, card tricks were in the majority.  I suppose that having said heavy drinks would have helped me enjoy the atmosphere better, but after a while it got boring.  I don't understand how people would pay lifetime or 30 day passes to this place.  For me, once was enough because of the repitition.  I do appreciate that the  magicians' dedication and composure.  In one show, there was an obnoxious kid who wanted to steal the thunder from the magician, but being a good entertainer, the magician played along.  Bravo to you Jheff with an H, I would I have slugged the kid.  True story.  I didn't have a chance to try the food.",3 star rating

It is a little confusing inside if you don't know your way around, but they have guides to give you a tour and it is a fascinating building. The dinner itself was quite good. I had the filet with came with grilled asparagus and cheesy au gratin potatoes. Hubs had the prime rib with garlic mashed potatoes and garden vegies. Both came with a standard type salad, but we also shared a bowl of lobster bisque which was excellent. After dinner we attended several shows in the different theater rooms (here is where local knowledge really would have helped to plan out the times, etc) and the entertainment was great. I highly recommend this place if you can get a member to get you in. Members must belong to one of two magician associations in order to be eligible for membership.

But, we hate paying the high prices to stay at the Magic Castle hotel which is decorated cheaply so next time we will email one of the magicians for complimentary passes.   The drinks at the Castle are quite expensive (in the $13 range for each one) and pretty mediocre.  Fortunately we brought our own wine for dinner which was a good deal! Dinner was overpriced and the food quality just average.   The prime rib was tasty enough and the filet of beef was tender but had no flavor. The chicken was nothing special, either. The salad dressing tasted like milk with a couple of flavorless chunks of ""blue cheese"" and the dessert (chocolate souffle - spongy in texture!)was just barely edible.   But, if you like magic, this is the place to be. Great magicians in a variety of settings (closeup and large stage) and they have wonderful roving magicians who will sit you down at a table and ""practice"" on you.  My 21 year old daughter was entranced by theshowmanship.  I wish we could go without having to eat a meal there!",2 star rating

In the entrance there was a big door and an owl-- an owl. Yes, an owl! As we checked in, they said to us: ""say open sesame"" all three of us looked to each other thinking, is this a joke? We were relieved when the door opened to our command. We had such an awesome time. The show was extremely funny. We really enjoyed ourselves. After the show we wandered away into our own little adventure. It was like going back to our childhood, and being curious exploring our way through this marvelous castle. We had couple drinks of wine. The bartender was really sweet, she let us try some of her favorite wine, while an owl kept talking back to us-- it was really funny. After, we discovered the secret button that was triggering him to do that. We had such a blast. Formal, formal, formal, it's a very classy place. At the end we got our own private magic show. We found a guy who had just done his show and was ready to go home. When he saw us, he said: ""ladies come here a minute.""  He did some fabulous card tricks with us, we were so amazed.
